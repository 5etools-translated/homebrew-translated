	"It currently is in the midst of a renaissance after hundreds of years of darkness following a terrible catastrophe that led to magic being made rare and unusual. Prior to the catastrophe magic was ubiquitous across cities and towns, and virtually every citizen had access to basic cantrips and common magical items that kept the wheels of civilisation turning. Without magic, the world entered a dark age. Cities splintered and old nations crumbled into isolated city states and tribes.": "在一场可怕的灾难导致魔法变得罕见和不寻常之后，经过数百年的黑暗，它目前正处于复兴之中。在这场灾难之前，魔法在城市和城镇中无处不在，几乎每个公民都能获得基本的咒语和普通的魔法物品，使文明的车轮不断转动。没有了魔法，世界进入了一个黑暗时代。城市四分五裂，古老的国家崩解成孤立的城邦和部落。",
	"What little magic was left became the stuff of fairytales and folklore. Hidden groves where magic still thrived were hidden away in nature, tended to by the few druids and {@class ranger|PHB|rangers} that were left in the world. {@class wizard|phb|Wizards} became a rare elite, and even the gods themselves could not escape the magical calamity. All were weakened, many disappeared entirely, and the few that were left had survived only by merging their portfolios together to safeguard civilisation.": "所剩无几的魔法成为童话和民间传说的素材。魔法仍然兴旺的隐蔽丛林被隐藏在自然界中，由世界上仅存的少数德鲁伊和（%0%）照顾着。{@class wizard|phb|Wizards}成为罕见的精英，甚至连神明本身也无法逃脱魔法的灾难。所有的人都被削弱了，许多人完全消失了，剩下的几个人只能通过合并他们的投资组合来保护文明而幸存下来。",
	"This devastating fall of magic led to the rise of new technologies. Ways of working metal and stone had to be developed once again, and currently the continent is comfortable in their use of bronze and iron. To the West, the newly formed {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} has revived the manufacture of steel, and it seems that the dark ages are near a close.": "这种毁灭性的魔法衰落导致了新技术的兴起。加工金属和石头的方法不得不再次被开发出来，目前该大陆对青铜和铁的使用很舒服。在西方，新成立的（%0%）已经恢复了钢铁的制造，看来黑暗时代已经接近尾声。",
	"War yet persists in the East, where dozens of city states vie for power. Instability creates opportunity, though. Several of the largest of them have risen up above the weaker cities in power. In the centre of the continent the valley of Kathkacha rolls in wealth from their mercantile deals with both the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} and the {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}. To the north, the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} benefit greatly from weakness in the south securing their borders.

	"It is a time where conflict and opportunity exist in equal supply. More than a few adventurers would throw themselves into these tumultuous times in search of gold and power. Others would hunt for the rare fragments of magic left in the world, as even something as simple as an ancient enchanted sword would give them a distinct edge. Others hunt down emerging instances of the supernatural that hide in the darkest corners of the world, hidden away from the watchful eyes of civilisation.": "这是一个冲突和机会并存的时代。不止几个冒险家会投身于这个动荡的时代，寻找黄金和权力。另一些人则会猎取留在世界上的罕见的魔法碎片，因为即使是像古代魔法剑这样简单的东西也会给他们带来明显的优势。还有人追捕隐藏在世界最黑暗角落里的新出现的超自然现象，远离文明的监视。",
	"It is into this strange land that you find yourself...": "正是在这片陌生的土地上，你发现自己......",
	"The continent itself has a long history, but before the collapse of magic only a small amount is known. Many ancient texts were lost following the collapse of the magic age, and what remains is found largely in the memories of the {@race elf|phb|elves} who were still alive in that period.": "大陆本身有着悠久的历史，但在魔法崩溃之前，人们只知道少量的内容。许多古老的文本在魔法时代崩溃后丢失了，剩下的主要是在那个时期还活着的（%0%）人的记忆中发现的。",
	"Before the collapse, there were many cities ruled by the most powerful wizard and priest class. Some were ruled well, whilst others were brutal dictatorships. There was also a massive variety of religion, featuring many deities familiar to other worlds, such as Tyr and Eredus, as well as gods native to the world of Gol, such as Aepoptosis, the primal god of violence, and Ukua, the goddess of civilisation.": "在崩溃之前，有许多城市被最强大的巫师和牧师阶层统治着。一些城市统治良好，而另一些则是残酷的独裁统治。宗教的种类也非常多，有许多其他世界熟悉的神灵，如泰尔（Tyr）和埃雷杜斯（Eredus），也有戈尔世界本土的神灵，如暴力的原始神Aepoptosis和文明的女神Ukua。",
	"In this time the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} did not exist, nor did the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} as we know them today.

	"The collapse occurred roughly five-hundred years ago. Cities like Kathkacha were abandoned in the chaos, and were only reclaimed later as the panic and terror subsided. Organisations formed to grant security to the people; most notable of these were the powerful {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} and the decentralised {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}. The Kathkacha valley was resettled by {@book Brasshand the Bold|BITCPI|8|Brasshand the Bold} after it abandoned its bloody ways worshipping the primal god of violence, Aepoptosis. {@book The Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} built themselves on the bones of the ancient mage-cities. Magic faded from prominence overnight, and in its place mercantilism and military might rose into newfound favour.": "崩溃发生在大约五百年前。像Kathkacha这样的城市在混乱中被遗弃，后来随着恐慌和恐怖的消退才被收回。形成了一些组织，给予人们安全感；其中最引人注目的是强大的（%0%）和分散的（%1%）。Kathkacha山谷在放弃了崇拜暴力原始神Aepoptosis的血腥方式后，被（%2%）重新安置。{@book The Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}在古老的魔法城市的骨架上建立了自己。魔法在一夜之间就淡出了人们的视线，取而代之的是重商主义和军事力量获得了新的青睐。",
	"Plunged into a technological dark age, many of the new civilisations were sent back into a proverbial stone age. Technology did not advance equally across all of the continent.

The rest of the world remains more comfortable with bronze and iron.": "陷入技术的黑暗时代，许多新的文明被送回传说中的石器时代。技术在整个大陆的发展并不均衡。{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}，争先恐后地夺回了古代文本和技术，蓬勃发展，并开始将钢铁重新引入他们的军队。世界其他地区仍然更喜欢使用青铜和铁。",
	"Today the status-quo between the civilisations of the Pevic Continent is stable. The {@book Aegan Empire's|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} expansion was halted by a sudden series of mysterious attacks along its coastline.

	"Perhaps the most powerful of the new world orders is the Aegan Empire.

	"Above all else, the Aegan Empire is obsessed with power. They are a military powerhouse, their martial prowess matched only by the {@book Helviti|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda}, but with the added advantage of size, a stronger and more reliable economy, and a prestigious navy. If left unchecked they might have invaded towards the centre of the continent, taking over {@book Kathkacha|BITCEH|1|Kathkacha} and penetrating into the {@book Eastern City States region|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}, and forming an Empire that spanned the width of the entire continent.": "最重要的是，伊根帝国对权力非常痴迷。他们是一个军事强国，他们的武功只有{@book Helviti|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda}可以比拟，但又有规模上的优势，有更强大、更可靠的经济，还有一支著名的海军。如果不加控制，他们可能会向大陆中心入侵，占领（%1%）并渗透到（%2%），形成一个横跨整个大陆的帝国。",
	"Their expanse was halted, however, as they found an enemy they never expected. Ships sent West, designed to explore the various islands and potentially discover new lands in the form of distant continents, returned as enemies. The seamen aboard their ships were driven mad, their bodies bearing signs of self-mutilation, and wreaked havoc across the Aegan coastline and island forts. More worrisome still were the ships they had {@i not} sent West that followed them. Ramshackle rafts carrying men and women of equal insanity, armed with crude but brutal weapons. They attacked with no mercy nor predictability, whooping and hollering as they disembarked upon the vulnerable shores. They killed and tormented without remorse, and this sudden string of attacks put the Aegan Empire on the defensive.": "然而，他们的扩张被阻止了，因为他们发现了一个他们从未料到的敌人。被派往西方的船只，旨在探索各个岛屿，并有可能发现遥远大陆形式的新土地，回来后却成了敌人。船上的海员被逼疯了，他们的身体上有自残的痕迹，并在伊甘海岸线和岛屿堡垒上造成了严重的破坏。更令人担忧的是，他们{@i not}派往西方的船只跟着他们。破旧的木筏上载着同样疯狂的男人和女人，装备着简陋而残忍的武器。他们毫不留情地攻击，也无法预测，在脆弱的海岸上登岸时大呼小叫。他们无怨无悔地杀戮和折磨，这一连串突如其来的攻击使伊耿帝国处于守势。",
	"Their focus became the formation of a deadly fleet and fortifying their coastal forts against attack. Never again would they allow themselves to be made vulnerable from the sea. The Aegan Fleet became the greatest in the world, but at the same time any hopes of conquest of the continent were dashed by the relentless naval attacks. To make matters worse, in a poorly judged moment of arrogance, their largest land army was devastated at the infamous {@book Battle of Looming Rock|BITCEH|1|The Battle at Looming Rock}. The formation of a fleet required coin and resources, and trade with the {@book East|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} provided both. Never again would the Aegan Empire pose a serious threat to the lands to the {@book East|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}.": "他们的重点是组建一支致命的舰队，并加固他们的沿海堡垒以抵御攻击。他们再也不允许自己从海上受到伤害。伊耿舰队成为世界上最伟大的舰队，但与此同时，任何征服大陆的希望都被无情的海军攻击所粉碎。更糟糕的是，在一个判断失误的傲慢时刻，他们最大的陆军在臭名昭著的{@book Battle of Looming Rock|BITCEH|1|The Battle at Looming Rock}被摧毁了。组建舰队需要钱币和资源，而与{@book East|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}的贸易提供了这两样东西。伊耿帝国再也不会对{@book East|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}的土地构成严重威胁了。",
	"The fear of attack from the sea allowed a powerful faction within the Aegan Empire to form: the {@book Steelmongers|BITCEH|2|Steelmongers}. This group pushed for the reclaiming of ancient arcane technology, and focussed much of their resources on advancing the military might of the Aegan Empire. Under their rule, the Aegan Empire became technologically advanced compared to the other nations in the Continent. Steel tips their magnificent {@object ballista} bolts, their {@vehicle warship|GoS|Warships} are twice the size of any other in the world, and magnificently engineered stone citadels dot the coast.": "对来自海上攻击的恐惧让伊耿帝国内部形成了一个强大的派别：（%0%）。这个团体推动了对古代奥术技术的回收，并将大部分资源集中在推进伊根帝国的军事力量上。在他们的统治下，与大陆上的其他国家相比，伊耿帝国的技术变得很先进。钢铁是他们宏伟的{@object ballista}螺栓，他们的{@vehicle warship|GoS|Warships}是世界上任何其他国家的两倍，宏伟的设计的石头城堡遍布海岸。",
	"In order to secure their rule, they entered into an alliance with the {@book Helviti Comanda|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda} in order to boost their control over the region.

	"There is little room for dissent under the rule of the {@book Steelmongers|BITCEH|2|Steelmongers}. Complete subservience to the Empire is mandatory. Despite their technological advances, the Aegan Empire is a brutal regime that cracks down on personal freedom in the name of securing its borders. In this, it is largely successful, though many chafe under its vicious rule. Whilst there are honourable and gentle members of the {@book Steelmonger|BITCEH|2|Steelmongers} ruling elite, most tend to be hard and cruel leaders focussed on amassing more power and military might.": "在{@book Steelmongers|BITCEH|2|Steelmongers}的统治下，几乎没有异议的空间。对帝国的完全顺从是强制性的。尽管技术先进，但伊耿帝国是一个残酷的政权，以确保边界安全为名，压制个人自由。在这一点上，它在很大程度上是成功的，尽管许多人在其恶毒的统治下感到不安。虽然在{@book Steelmonger|BITCEH|2|Steelmongers}的统治精英中也有可敬和温和的成员，但大多数人都是专注于积累更多权力和军事力量的强硬和残忍的领导人。",
	"The Aegan Empire entered into a brief war against the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} as it overstepped its bounds in the north. This war saw the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} as victors. After many years roaming the seas, the Empire was ill-prepared for a ground war against the rough barbaric tactics of the north, and their forces were decimated at the disaster that was the {@book Battle of Looming Rock|BITCEH|1|The Battle at Looming Rock} which saw them enter into conflict with their {@book Helviti|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda} allies.

	"Across the Pevic Continent, no land is more inhospitable than the dreaded Helviti Wastes. A land drenched in coarse sand, dirt, ash, vile gasses, and violent beasts. The wildlife is considered to be so hostile to civilised life that when the poisoned ash blows across the paths the Helviti consider it a blessing; at least when the poison gasses make it near impossible to breathe without wearing special masks the wildlife doesn't tend to attack. Except the devil vampire crabs. Nothing stops the devil vampire crabs. The only habitable spots (relatively speaking) are a small number of oases that dot the landscape. These oases are home to the most dangerous civilisation in terms of raw fighting prowess: the Helviti.": "在整个Pevic大陆上，没有哪块土地比可怕的Helviti荒原更荒凉。这片土地被粗沙、泥土、灰烬、邪恶的气体和凶猛的野兽所浸染。野生动物被认为对文明生活充满敌意，当有毒的灰烬吹过道路时，赫尔维蒂人认为这是一种祝福；至少当毒气使人在不戴特殊面具的情况下几乎无法呼吸时，野生动物并不倾向于攻击。除了恶魔吸血蟹。没有什么能阻止恶魔吸血蟹。唯一适合居住的地方（相对而言）是少量的绿洲，它们点缀着这片土地。这些绿洲是在原始战斗力方面最危险的文明的家园：赫维提人。",
	"The Helviti are a rough, violent people adjusted to living in the most dangerous land in the Continent. They are largely organised into groups known as {@book Comanda|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda}, which operate like clans, or a mercenary company. Each {@book Comanda|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda} has a name, and famous Comanda are legendary across the Continent.

For this reason, the Helviti found themselves in a uniquely profitable position.": "尽管荒原上有很多危险，包括脱水、迷失方向，以及在凶恶的巨型沙蜥、{@creature Winged Spider|BloodInTheCompany|winged spiders}和虫猫的胃里消化，但赫尔维蒂荒原是连接{@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}、卡斯卡查、{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}和{@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}的最快和最直接的路径，不需要在无情和险恶的山脉上行军或在海岸上航行。由于这个原因，赫尔维蒂人发现自己处于一个独特的有利地位。",
	"The Helviti Wastelanders don't have many defining battles due to their disparate clan-like nature. For this reason, the Battle of Looming Rock, also known as the battle of the Five Comanda, stands out. Serving the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, the Lion Comanda and the Devil Comanda both marched against an army from the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} alongside an Aegan force.

	"In order to protect their reputation and prevent similar breaches in contract from other nations, Lion and Devil Comanda both sent a call to the Topaz, Horsehair, and Whistle Comanda who were in the region.

	"Sensing defeat and dreading the complete loss of the Aegan army, the Aegan Commander at the time quickly ordered the Helviti to be paid in full.

	"The battle ended as a pyrrhic victory for the Aegan forces, who had lost such a substantial portion of their forces to Helviti harrying from the Horsehair and Whistle Comanda that their aspirations to march on the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} were irreparably halted. The Helviti had cemented their reputation as a force not to be crossed. The Devil Comanda continues to serve the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, who relies heavily on their service and continues to pay them handsomely to this day.": "这场战役对伊耿军队来说是一场不折不扣的胜利，他们在赫尔维蒂人从马鬃和哨子康达的骚扰下损失了大量的兵力，他们向(%)进军的愿望被无可挽回地停止了。赫尔维蒂人巩固了他们作为一支不可逾越的力量的声誉。恶魔科曼达继续为{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}服务，{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}非常依赖他们的服务，并继续向他们支付丰厚的报酬，直到今天。",

	"Taking this mentality of using their martial skills for profit, many of their Comanda export themselves to the rest of the world as mercenaries.

Kraken Comanda sails the seas alongside the Aegans to protect against the maddened sea-people, {@book Cobalt Comanda|BITCPI|4|Cobalt Comanda} guards the {@book Brass Palace|BITCPI|5|The Brass Palace} in Kathkach, and Wendigo Comanda spreads itself far and wide, individual members sending back their earnings to the homeland.": "带着这种以武会友的心态，他们中的许多人将自己作为雇佣兵出口到世界其他地方。由于赫尔维蒂人终生致力于战斗和暴力，并拥有一套高度专业化的技能，他们往往能够击败比自己规模大得多的军队，因此经常被买来作为{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}、{@book Kathkacha|BITCEH|1|Kathkacha}和{@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}中较富裕成员的护卫。Kraken Comanda与Aegans一起在海上航行，保护他们不受疯狂的海民的伤害，{@book Cobalt Comanda|BITCPI|4|Cobalt Comanda}在Kathkach守卫{@book Brass Palace|BITCPI|5|The Brass Palace}，而Wendigo Comanda则远近闻名，个别成员将其收入寄回故乡。",
	"Each Comanda follows a strict and complex code that involves not taking any action that would harm the homeland. They are even permitted to fight one another if so doing brings profit to the homeland and does not endanger their security at home.": "每个科曼达都遵循严格而复杂的准则，包括不采取任何会损害祖国的行动。他们甚至被允许相互争斗，如果这样做能给祖国带来利益，并且不危及他们在国内的安全。",
	"The image abroad of the Helviti is therefore one of violent barbarians and professional killers. At home, the truth is more nuanced. The towns around the oases are filled with civilians and even artists. These people are rougher than most due to their environment, but nonetheless it can be surprising for many outsiders to see this softer side of the Helviti Comanda.": "因此，赫尔维蒂人在国外的形象是暴力的野蛮人和职业杀手。在国内，事实则更加微妙。绿洲周围的城镇充满了平民，甚至是艺术家。由于所处的环境，这些人比大多数人都要粗暴，但尽管如此，许多外人看到赫尔维蒂人柔和的一面，也会感到惊讶。",
	"To a Helviti, one is only considered an adult if one joins and proves themselves to a Comanda. An adult is given a suit of armour to protect themselves, and these armours can vary in origin and type. Some are made abroad, some are passed down generations, and some are built to order for the individual Helviti. As there is a lack of resources in the Wastes, this results in a patchwork look to most warriors from this region. Children work in the Wastes to maintain food supplies, tend to homes, and other less violent tasks. They are offered protection by the powerful Comanda, though this protection is retracted if they leave the Wastes and cease contributing to their society.": "对赫尔维蒂人来说，只有当一个人加入并向科曼达证明自己是成年人时，才被认为是成年人。一个成年人会得到一套盔甲来保护自己，这些盔甲的来源和类型各不相同。有些是国外制造的，有些是世代相传的，有些则是为个人赫尔维蒂人量身定做的。由于荒原上缺乏资源，这导致这个地区的大多数战士看起来都是拼凑起来的。孩子们在荒原上工作，维持食物供应，照顾家庭，以及其他不太暴力的任务。他们得到了强大的科曼达（Comanda）的保护，但如果他们离开荒原，不再为社会做出贡献，这种保护就会被收回来。",
	"Also present in the Wastes are nomadic tribes that follow oral traditions. These groups live in harmony with the more civilised Comanda and often work alongside them during travels through the Wastes. These nomadic groups remember the times before the collapse, and train to hunt down magic and harness it through martial arts. These nomadic groups form the basis of many monastic orders, such as the influential Helviti Inquisition. Martial arts across the continent mostly stems from these nomadic tribes.": "荒原上还有一些遵循口头传统的游牧部落。这些群体与文明程度较高的科曼达人和谐相处，在穿越荒原时经常与他们一起工作。这些游牧群体记得崩溃前的时代，并通过武术训练来猎取魔法和驾驭它。这些游牧群体构成了许多修道会的基础，比如有影响力的赫尔维蒂宗教裁判所。整个大陆的武术大多源于这些游牧部落。",
	"Depending on what Comanda one might encounter, one's experience of the Helviti could be radically different. Whereas the {@book Chimera Comanda|BITCPI|4|Chimera Comanda} focus on cruelty, for instance, Gold Comanda are well reputed for their noble disposition.": "根据一个人可能遇到的科曼达，一个人对赫尔维蒂人的体验可能是完全不同的。例如，{@book Chimera Comanda|BITCPI|4|Chimera Comanda}的人注重残忍，而黄金科曼达则因其高贵的性情而享有盛誉。",

	"The Northern Kingdoms are a loose organisation of a half-dozen kings and queens who rule the cold, grassy hills to the north of the {@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes}.

They have been at peace for many years, with only small skirmishes against some {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} trying to march over the mountains into their land and one war against the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} that resulted in a win for the fearsome northern warriors.": "北部王国是一个由半打国王和女王组成的松散组织，他们统治着{@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes}北部寒冷的草丛山地。他们拥有丰富的资源，尽管他们有野蛮和落后的名声，但却令人惊讶地强大和安全。他们多年来一直处于和平状态，只对一些试图翻山越岭进入他们土地的（1%）进行过小规模的冲突，还有一次对（2%）的战争，结果是可怕的北方战士获胜。",
	"Contrary to the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, the Northern Kingdoms prefer ambush and guerilla tactics, and their strategies focus on mobility, camouflage, and quick daring strikes. In the hilly, grassy terrain they live in, they have plenty of cover to conceal themselves in and are far more mobile than large, slow columns that the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} prefers.": "与{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}相反，北方王国更喜欢伏击和游击战术，他们的战略重点是机动性、伪装和快速大胆的打击。在他们居住的丘陵、草丛地形中，他们有大量的掩体可以隐藏自己，而且比（1%）喜欢的大而慢的纵队要机动得多。",
	"Not only are the Northern Kingdoms well adjusted to their colder climate but they have a disproportionately high number of magical groves still present in their lands. This means that their society has a higher number of {@race elf|phb|elves}, {@class ranger|phb|rangers}, and {@class druid|phb|druids} than one might expect to see in other regions of the Pevic Continent. They are not so frequently seen to be considered common by any means, but in a world where magic is rare, it is a notable enough increase in magical power to be considered a strategic advantage. For this reason, many {@class wizard|phb|wizards} also pass through the Northern Kingdoms in order to visit and study some of the better known groves of this land.": "北方王国不仅很好地适应了他们的寒冷气候，而且他们的土地上还存在着不成比例的高数量的魔法丛林。这意味着他们的社会拥有的（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）的数量比人们在佩维克大陆其他地区看到的要多。他们的出现频率不高，无论如何也不会被认为是常见的，但在一个魔法罕见的世界里，魔法力量的显著增加足以被认为是一种战略优势。出于这个原因，许多人（3%）也会经过北方王国，以访问和研究这片土地上一些比较知名的丛林。",
	"The Northern Kingdoms have an extensive farming society, along with a lot of fishing and hunting. They are typically well fed and hearty, and are known for their sense of humour and welcoming attitude towards foreigners from the south. They trade their natural resources, mostly {@item iron|PHB}, {@item copper|PHB}, {@item silver|PHB}, and {@item wheat|PHB|grain} with the powerful city of {@book Kathkach|BITCPI|4} in the south through the {@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes}.": "北方王国有一个广泛的农业社会，同时还有大量的渔猎活动。他们通常食物充足，身体强健，以幽默感和对来自南方的外国人的欢迎态度而闻名。他们通过{@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes}与南方强大的{@book Kathkach|BITCPI|4}城市交易他们的自然资源，主要是{@item iron|PHB}、{@item copper|PHB}、{@item silver|PHB}和{@item wheat|PHB|grain}。",
	"After a series of skirmishes on their border, they employ the services of the Horse Comanda to protect their borders. Compared to other Comanda it is small, and primarily serves as a scouting unit to provide warning to the armies of barbaric soldiers waiting in scattered stone castles and forts.": "在他们的边界发生了一系列的小规模冲突后，他们雇佣了马队Comanda的服务来保护他们的边界。与其他科曼达相比，它的规模很小，主要是作为侦察部队，为在分散的石堡和要塞中等待的野蛮士兵的军队提供警告。",
	"Their rich homeland has allowed the Northern Kingdoms to be a kinder, softer land to live in. Art is encouraged, as is literature, and stories of heroic warriors and lovestruck paladins are sung by {@class bard|PHB|bards} across the land. Chivalry is a well-regarded ideal in the Northern Kingdoms, and the warriors of that region often try to live up to such lofty expectations.  They like bravery, honour, and valiance. They also admire beauty, skill, and poetry.": "他们丰富的故乡让北方王国成为一个更仁慈、更柔和的居住地。艺术受到鼓励，文学也是如此，英雄的战士和痴情的圣骑士的故事被{@class bard|PHB|bards}的人传唱于整个土地。骑士精神在北方王国是一个备受推崇的理想，而该地区的勇士们也经常试图实现这样崇高的期望。 他们喜欢勇敢、荣誉和英勇。他们也推崇美貌、技巧和诗歌。",
	"Korigvit is a small valley south of Dostym which would have been peaceful if not for a rebellion of peasants seeking to depose the local ruler. The King of Dostym famously quelled the rebellion by making a deal with the local Grovers, trapping the rebellion within a maze of thick brambles and trees. The time it took for the rebels to escape, Dostym had already scrambled its forces and cornered them.": "科里格维特是多斯特姆南部的一个小山谷，如果不是因为农民叛乱，试图推翻当地的统治者，这个山谷本来是很平静的。多斯特姆的国王通过与当地的格罗弗斯达成协议，将叛军困在一个由厚厚的荆棘和树木组成的迷宫中，从而平息了这场著名的叛乱。叛军逃跑的时候，多斯特姆已经争先恐后地把部队逼到了角落。",
	"The King took a relaxed view on the rebellion and withheld punishment... though he did scatter the rebels throughout the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}, rendering it almost impossible for them to organise again.": "国王对叛乱采取了宽松的态度，没有进行惩罚......尽管他确实将叛乱者分散到整个（%0%），使他们几乎不可能再次组织起来。",
	"All is not perfect in the land in the north, though. The same seamen raiders that plague the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} sometimes find their way north, and this often compels local kings nearer to the {@book Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} to work alongside the {@book Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} despite their at-times violent relationship. The cold winters also tend to put their lives on hold for months at a time, as regions can become nearly untraversable without well-equipped caravans. The groves are also sometimes a source of trouble. The {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} are one of the few places where some supernatural stories are taken seriously.": "不过，北方的土地上并非一切完美。困扰{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}的海员突袭者有时也会找到北方，这常常迫使靠近{@book Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}的当地国王与{@book Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}一起工作，尽管他们的关系有时很暴力。寒冷的冬天也往往使他们的生活一连几个月被搁置，因为如果没有装备精良的大篷车，这些地区几乎是无法通行的。丛林有时也是麻烦的来源。{@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}是少数几个认真对待一些超自然故事的地方之一。",
	"It is said that the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} is the home to the mysterious {@book Tower of Eyes|BITCEH|2|The Tower of Eyes}, an organisation aimed at investigating and controlling the supernatural in the Pevic Region. It is not known whether this is true or not as the {@book Tower of Eyes|BITCEH|2|The Tower of Eyes} guards its secrets well, but it is certainly true that a fair few of their agents can be found in the large cities of the Kingdoms, such as Dostym or Berovika.": "据说{@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}是神秘的{@book Tower of Eyes|BITCEH|2|The Tower of Eyes}的所在地，这个组织旨在调查和控制佩维奇地区的超自然现象。由于{@book Tower of Eyes|BITCEH|2|The Tower of Eyes}很好地保护了自己的秘密，所以不知道这是否是真的，但在王国的大城市，如多斯特姆或贝罗维卡，可以找到他们相当多的代理人，这是事实。",
	"Many of the northmen emigrate south in search of wealth and exploration. Many southerners also emigrate north to enjoy the lifestyle and peace that can be found there... if they can successfully traverse the {@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes}.": "许多北方人移居南方，寻找财富和探索。许多南方人也移民到北方，享受那里的生活方式和和平......如果他们能成功穿越（%0%）。",
	"It is not as simple to categorise the Eastern City States as one distinct bloc, as many of them have their own history, culture, and social identity. As a bloc, it is this disunity that ironically serves as a point of commonality. The traditions of each often conflict and contrast against one another, and whilst this gives them a patchwork make-up of social identities, there are some elements that are common to most of the City States.": "把东部城市国家归类为一个独特的集团并不那么简单，因为其中许多国家有自己的历史、文化和社会身份。作为一个集团，正是这种不统一性讽刺地成为一个共同点。每个国家的传统往往相互冲突和对比，虽然这使他们的社会身份拼凑起来，但有一些元素是大多数城市国家所共有的。",
	"The Eastern City States are widely regarded as being artistic and vibrant. Perhaps it is the clashes of culture that keeps their art, literature, and music rapidly evolving and complex. They are also rapidly evolving, and despite instability, are flexible and adaptable people who are as suited to war as they are to trade.": "东部城市州被广泛认为是具有艺术性和活力的。也许正是由于文化的冲突，使他们的艺术、文学和音乐保持快速发展和复杂。他们也在迅速发展，尽管不稳定，但他们是灵活和适应性强的民族，既适合战争，也适合贸易。",
	"Whilst there are dozens of city states in the Eastern region, there are three major cities that make up the balance of power in the region. Parche is a warlike city to the north, near the border of the great mountain ranges that separate them from the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}. More distant from the river Kacha compared to other cities, Parche is fiercely independent due to its difficulty trading with the rest of the world.": "虽然东部地区有几十个城邦，但有三个主要城市构成了该地区的权力平衡。帕尔切是北方的一个好战城市，靠近将他们与{@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}的大山脉的边界。与其他城市相比，帕尔什离卡察河更远，由于难以与世界其他地方进行贸易，因此帕尔什具有激烈的独立性。",
	"Yayoi rules over a large swathe of territory by the eastern coast and despite frequent raids and wars with its neighbours, still boasts extensive farmland and agriculture. It flipflops between trading with nearby Chineria and Parche and being at war with them. Some of its land begins to enter into the {@book treacherous jungles|BITCPI|7|The Untamed Jungles} to the south, and they are known for being a uniquely colourful people.": "Yayoi统治着东部沿海的大片领土，尽管经常遭到袭击并与邻国发生战争，但它仍然拥有广泛的农田和农业。它在与附近的奇尼亚和帕切进行贸易和与他们交战之间摇摆不定。它的一些土地开始进入南部的（%0%），他们以独特的色彩丰富的民族而闻名。",
	"Chineria is situated on the river Kacha and often acts as a gateway to the rest of the City States. It is unquestionably the richest of the City States, though it's wealth pales in comparison to that of {@book Kathkach|BITCPI|4} further down the Kacha.": "奇尼里亚位于卡察河上，经常充当通往其他城邦的门户。它无疑是城邦中最富有的，尽管它的财富与卡察河下游的（%0%）相比，相形见绌。",
	"The Eastern City States are also unique in that they maintain some of the old traditions from before the collapse of magic. Yayoi is still ruled by an arcane elite, though dramatically reduced in power compared to the days of old. Parche exports ancient reproductions of arcane texts, primarily to the distant {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, at great profit. Were the region not constantly unstable, they may well be the most powerful in the entire continent, but alas, they are unable to form a persistent alliance.": "东部城邦的独特之处在于，他们保持着魔法崩溃前的一些古老传统。Yayoi仍然被一个奥术精英统治着，尽管与过去的日子相比，权力大大减少。帕切出口古老的奥术文本复制品，主要是向远方（%0%）出口，利润巨大。如果不是这个地区一直不稳定，他们很可能是整个大陆上最强大的，但可惜的是，他们无法形成一个持久的联盟。",
	"Wars are fought in this region often by proxy. Smaller cities and fortified towns are given support by Parche, Chineria, or Yayoi to skirmish against one-another and secure small gains in control or territory to the larger city states. This is a status-quo that has persisted for close to two-hundred years now, and shows no sign of slowing down.": "在这个地区，战争往往是通过代理方式进行的。较小的城市和坚固的城镇得到帕切、奇尼亚或弥生的支持，彼此进行小规模冲突，并确保较大的城市国家在控制权或领土上获得小的收益。这是一个已经持续了近两百年的现状，并且没有减缓的迹象。",
	"As a result many emigrate from the Eastern City States. If one doesn't live in one of the three major cities, it's likely that life is hard and at times violent. Raids and pillaging are frequent. A significant number of refugees are found in Kathkacha, working in the {@book vineyards|BITCPI|5|The Wine Farms}, farmlands, or {@book copper mines|BITCPI|5|The Copper Mines of Coprun}. Many others seek refuge to the north, but reaching the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} past the treacherous mountains is risky and often fatal. Pursuing an escape through the {@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes} is either one of two things: expensive, or suicide.": "因此，许多人从东部城市国家移居到这里。如果不是住在三个主要城市之一，很可能生活很艰难，有时还很暴力。袭击和掠夺是经常发生的。相当数量的难民被发现在卡思卡查，在（%0%）、农田或（%1%）工作。还有许多人向北方寻求庇护，但经过险峻的山脉到达（%2%）是很危险的，而且往往是致命的。通过{@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes}寻求逃亡是两件事中的一件：昂贵，或自杀。",
	"Many in this region therefore explore the {@book jungles|BITCPI|7|The Untamed Jungles} to the south. Whilst uninhabited by any large civilisation, there is still a lot of land in the jungle. Many do not return, and communities there are often short-lived. For those that survive, however, profit can be immense. There are as-yet undiscovered resources in the jungles to the south, and it is a bounty that, whilst risky, some brave entrepreneurs would gladly explore...": "因此，这一地区的许多人都在探索南方的（%0%）。虽然没有任何大型文明的居住地，但丛林中仍有大量的土地。许多人没有回来，那里的社区往往是短命的。然而，对于那些生存下来的人来说，利润可能是巨大的。南方的丛林里有尚未被发现的资源，虽然风险很大，但一些勇敢的企业家还是很乐意去探索这些资源......",
	"Kathkach is an old city with a complex history. Its history is in fact the oldest of any city on the Pevic Continent, with records sourced from Parche's ancient libraries citing Kathkach as one of the first named cities to be built before the collapse. Kathkach sits on the banks of the river Kacha, and controls the valley named after it: Kathkacha.": "卡思卡奇是一座有着复杂历史的古老城市。它的历史实际上是佩维奇大陆上所有城市中最古老的，从帕切的古代图书馆中得到的记录显示，卡思卡赫是崩溃前最早被命名的城市之一。卡特卡奇坐落在卡夏河畔，控制着以它命名的山谷。卡特卡奇。",
	"Resettled in the new age by the prophetic figure, the {@book Dyvare|BITCPI|8|The Dyvare}, Kathkach is built in a fertile and rich valley where {@item fine wine (bottle)|PHB|wine} can easily be made, {@item copper|PHB} mined, and crops harvested.": "在新时代，由预言家{@book Dyvare|BITCPI|8|The Dyvare}重新安置的Kathkach建在一个肥沃富饶的山谷中，这里可以很容易地制造{@item fine wine (bottle)|PHB|wine}，开采{@item copper|PHB}，并收获农作物。",
	"The city once had a bloody history and under the rule of its arcane masters worshipped the god of violence, Aepoptosis, and frequently sacrificed slaves in his name in brutal fighting pits. This grim history was left behind after the collapse. With Aepoptosis gone and the new gods all that remained, Kathkach was abandoned for a hundred years until it was recaptured by the {@book Dyvare|BITCPI|8|The Dyvare} and turned towards a more profitable goal: mercantilism.": "这座城市曾经有一段血腥的历史，在其奥术师的统治下，崇拜暴力之神Aepoptosis，并经常以他的名义在残酷的战斗坑里牺牲奴隶。这段残酷的历史在崩塌后被留下了。随着Aepoptosis的消失和新神的出现，Kathkach被遗弃了一百年，直到它被{@book Dyvare|BITCPI|8|The Dyvare}夺回并转向一个更有利的目标：重商主义。",
	"Kathkacha is the wealthiest region in the known world. Whilst the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} might have more wealth over its vast territory and the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} might have more natural resources, Kathkacha's position south of the {@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes} and in-between the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} and the {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} have allowed it to thrive. More gold per-capita is found here than anywhere else, and it is of little surprise that society flourishes in such a bastion of wealth.": "Kathkacha是已知世界上最富有的地区。虽然{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}可能在其广阔的领土上拥有更多的财富，{@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}可能拥有更多的自然资源，但卡思卡查在{@book Helviti Wastes|BITCEH|1|The Helviti Wastes}南部和{@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}与{@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}之间的位置使其得以繁荣发展。在这里发现的人均黄金比其他任何地方都多，在这样一个财富堡垒中，社会繁荣也就不足为奇。",
	"It is therefore ironic that its military is somewhat behind those found in the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} and the {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}. Its armies still prefer bronze due to the valley's cheap access to it, and as it has been a very peaceful region the military sciences have not advanced at the same pace as the {@book Aegan Empire's|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} or the {@book Eastern City States'|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} has. Its manufacturing sciences, however, are second to none. Resources from the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} are often sent to Kathkacha to be worked into tools and other products.": "因此，具有讽刺意味的是，它的军队在某种程度上落后于（%0%）和（%1%）的军队。它的军队仍然喜欢使用青铜，因为山谷里可以廉价获得青铜，而且由于它一直是一个非常和平的地区，军事科学没有像{@book Aegan Empire's|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}或{@book Eastern City States'|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}那样快速发展。然而，它的制造科学是首屈一指的。来自{@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}的资源经常被送到Kathkacha，被加工成工具和其他产品。",

	"If magic is rare, then the influence of powerful magical entities is even rarer. It is more common for an {@class warlock|phb|archfey|Archfey} or archdevil to simply find an easier world to influence, so those that remain in Gol are either stubbornly persistent or immensely powerful.
