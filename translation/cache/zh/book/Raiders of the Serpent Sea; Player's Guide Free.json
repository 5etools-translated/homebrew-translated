	"Among every clan there might be wizards of both persuasions, though dreamers often hide their true nature. Not that it matters, for most raiders dislike any and all wizards, due to their association with the magic of Mirgal. Owing to this, most raider wizards are isolated and surly.

	"Writing is an uncommon practice for raiders and they often rely on oral traditions to pass knowledge from one generation to another. Wizards are among the few groups that use writing daily but given the limited access to writing material, primal wizards chose to ink their magic onto their very flesh.": "对突击队员来说，书写是一种不常见的做法，他们经常依靠口述传统来将知识代代相传。巫师是少数几个每天使用书写的群体之一，但鉴于获得书写材料的机会有限，原始巫师选择将他们的魔法涂在自己的肉体上。",

	"If anything, the tallfolk downplay their strength, walking hunched among other humanoids, and speaking quietly to avoid the startling effect their booming voices may otherwise have. Many tallfolk, as they age, also begin to hear whispers ... a faceless voice whose words are never heard clearly.

	"This is a fantasy world where you will encounter peoples, creatures, and gods that will be familiar to those who admire Norse mythology. But this world is a blend of high fantasy and what we imagine a darker world of grim seafaring raiders might look like. It is a new world, birthed by the destruction of a much older civilization. Creatures from our prehistoric past the saber-toothed tiger, bears the size of longships, and vast herds of mammoth coexist with fantastic sea serpents, grim giants, illusive dragons, and the world devourers, the Yoten. The raiding peoples of Grimnir live amongst these creatures in the unstable, primal world they all inhabit. No stretch of land, of forest, of sea is entirely safe.": "这是一个奇幻的世界，你会遇到那些欣赏北欧神话的人所熟悉的民族、生物和神灵。但这个世界融合了高级幻想和我们想象中的黑暗的航海突击队员的世界的样子。这是一个新的世界，由一个更古老的文明的毁灭所孕育。来自史前时代的生物，如剑齿虎、有长船那么大的熊、成群结队的猛犸象，与神奇的海蛇、狰狞的巨人、虚幻的龙，以及世界的吞噬者--约顿共存。格里姆尼尔的掠夺者在这些生物中生活，他们都居住在不稳定的原始世界。没有一片土地、森林和海洋是完全安全的。",
	"In your hands, your party will live the life of glory seeking Vikings. Their deeds may become the sagas of future generations, and if they live well and boldly (and survive) they may even become something akin to the gods and goddesses from those old stories and myths. Regardless, though their fate may seem determined, their actions and yours as gamemaster shall decide whether this world meets the fate of the one that came before it or if Grimnir finally breaks free from the eternal cycle we call Ragnarök.": "在你手中，你的队伍将过上追求荣耀的维京人的生活。他们的事迹可能会成为后世的传奇，如果他们活得好，活得大胆（活下来），他们甚至可能成为类似于那些古老故事和神话中的神灵。无论如何，尽管他们的命运似乎已经确定，但他们的行动和你作为游戏管理员的行动将决定这个世界是否会遇到之前的命运，或者Grimnir是否最终从我们称之为Ragnarök的永恒循环中挣脱出来。",
	"The stories of Vikings have always lived large in our imaginations and there are as many flavors of these stories as there are storytellers.

	"I have long been enamored with these people who sailed the seas of the hardy north. My initial interest perhaps stemmed from a different source than many others. It was a volcanic island that brought me to the Vikings. Surtsey surfaced in the 60s, south of Iceland in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. The idea that in our time (with the geography of the world feeling so static and unchanging to me) new masses of land might be created... that parts of the world could be formed before our eyes, was beyond fascinating. I began devouring the sagas, legends, and myths of Iceland and even wrote a few fantasy stories set in a mythical world inspired in part by what I learned. This was a long time ago!": "长期以来，我一直迷恋着这些在艰苦的北方海上航行的人们。我最初的兴趣也许来自与许多人不同的来源。是一个火山岛把我带到了维京人的身边。Surtsey是在60年代出现的，在冰岛南部的Vestmannaeyjar群岛。在我们这个时代（世界的地理环境对我来说是如此的静止和不变），新的土地可能被创造出来......世界的一部分可能在我们眼前形成，这个想法是非常迷人的。我开始吞噬冰岛的传奇故事、传说和神话，甚至写了一些以神话世界为背景的幻想故事，部分灵感来自我所学到的东西。这是很久以前的事了。",
	"A couple years past, I was finally able to travel to Iceland and explore it myself and though I never made it to Surtsey, I did stay on the island Heimaey. The rough, wave-tossed journey made me aware that I would be a rather pathetic Viking, but I was immediately enamored with that rugged, windy place! It was perhaps there that I first began to think about this book, specifically.": "几年过去了，我终于能够去冰岛旅行并亲自探索它，虽然我没有到过苏尔塞，但我确实在海马伊岛呆过。崎岖不平、波涛汹涌的旅程使我意识到我将是一个相当可怜的维京人，但我立即迷上了那个崎岖、多风的地方 也许正是在那里，我第一次开始具体思考这本书。",
	"Vikings are much beloved, from the early stories and myths, to their depictions in popular comics, and even to the (somewhat) more historically accurate shows streaming across all the popular platforms. We know a lot about them but there are also gaps in our knowledge: room enough for our imaginations to fill. It is only natural that the core themes exploration, bravery, sacrifice, and fate become the backbone of a roleplaying fantasy campaign.": "维京人备受喜爱，从早期的故事和神话，到流行漫画中对他们的描述，甚至到所有流行平台上流传的（有点）更符合历史的节目。我们对他们了解很多，但我们的知识也有差距：有足够的空间让我们的想象力来填补。核心主题探索、勇敢、牺牲和命运成为角色扮演的幻想活动的支柱，这是很自然的。",
	"It has been an exciting journey so far to build this fantasy world for the 5th edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game. Grimnir has many layers its core is set in the early myths of the Vikings, but it is also heavily inspired by all the various ways we have come to admire these peoples. There are even pieces of my own stories written and published over the decades and my earlier campaigns to be found herein.": "到目前为止，为世界上最伟大的角色扮演游戏的第五版建立这个奇幻世界是一个令人兴奋的旅程。Grimnir有很多层次，其核心是以维京人的早期神话为背景，但它也受到了我们对这些民族的各种崇拜的启发。这里甚至还有我自己几十年来写的和发表的故事以及我早期的战役的片段。",
	"Inspired by the stories told of Viking seafarers, and the myths and narratives important to those explorers, this book will help you build a rich Viking-themed world. Set in Grimnir, a world born from the destruction of the {@i Lost Lands}, the raiding clans compete against and exploit one another in their drive to survive amidst many deadly perils.": "本书的灵感来自于维京海员的故事，以及对这些探险家来说很重要的神话和叙事，将帮助你建立一个丰富的维京主题世界。本书的背景是Grimnir，一个从{@i Lost Lands}的毁灭中诞生的世界，在许多致命的危险中，突击部族为了生存而相互竞争、相互利用。",
	"The campaign is designed for the 5th Edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game. It starts with 4-6 heroes of 1st level and will take them on a journey across storm tossed seas, through haunted forests, ancient ruins, and into lands never explored by the living, as they journey to 10th level or higher. While sailing the Serpent Sea they may witness vast herds of furred beasts stampeding along icy coastlines, volcanoes rising unexpectedly to birth new islands before their eyes, or inland forests quivering and shaking as giants prepare raiding parties of their own.": "该活动是为世界上最伟大的角色扮演游戏的第五版设计的。它从4-6个1级的英雄开始，将带领他们穿越风暴翻滚的海洋，穿过闹鬼的森林、古老的废墟，进入从未被活人探索过的土地，他们的旅程将达到10级或以上。在蛇海航行时，他们可能会看到大量的毛皮动物沿着冰冷的海岸线奔跑，火山出乎意料地上升，在他们眼前诞生了新的岛屿，或者内陆森林在颤抖，巨人在准备自己的突击队。",
	"Raiders of the Serpent Sea has a primary epic narrative divided into four main acts but with numerous opportunities for players to build longships, conquer settlements, and even assemble their own clan to stand against their foes at the end of the world.": "蛇海攻略》有一个主要的史诗叙事，分为四个主要行为，但有许多机会让玩家建造长船，征服定居点，甚至组建自己的部族，在世界的尽头与敌人抗衡。",
	"In the beginning, a fate rune is cast by the raider seers (known as the völv) for every soul braving the world of Grimnir. Each hero must embrace that fate to save this world during the inevitable final battle even if the sacrifices they must make are cruel, unfair, and devastating. Heroes in Grimnir persevere against overwhelming odds and devastating setbacks. Only the bold shall succeed.": "在一开始，突袭者预言家（被称为völv）为每一个勇闯Grimnir世界的灵魂铸造了一个命运符文。在不可避免的最后一战中，每个英雄都必须接受这一命运以拯救这个世界，即使他们必须做出的牺牲是残酷的、不公平的和毁灭性的。Grimnir中的英雄们面对压倒性的困难和破坏性的挫折，坚持不懈。只有勇敢的人才能成功。",
	"And yet... even if the world is saved, {@i how} the heroes save it forever alters the future.": "然而......即使世界被拯救了，（%0%）英雄们的拯救也永远改变了未来。",
	"Centuries ago, upon a vast, beautiful, and wondrous world, a horde of shape changing fiends known as the Yoten warred with the heroic Vanir. The Yoten's leader, Boða, used might and treachery to force her way across those fabled lands till the Vanir were left defending a single settlement. All that remained of their culture and people made their stand within that walled city.": "几个世纪前，在一个辽阔、美丽、奇妙的世界上，一群被称为Yoten的变形魔鬼与英勇的瓦尼尔人发生战争。Yoten的领袖Boða利用强大的力量和背叛，强行穿越那些传说中的土地，直到瓦尼尔人只剩下守卫一个定居点。他们所有的文化和人民都在那座有围墙的城市里立足。",
	"At Boða's side stood Mirgal, whose earlier betrayals had already weakened his former Vanir allies. In exchange for the power Boða offered, Mirgal had become her consort and the architect of the Lost Land's utter destruction. At the bloody climax of the battle Mirgal's own creations a feral wolf the size of a longship, a sinewy serpent capable of disintegrating opponents with her poison, and many others joined the fray. Scores perished against these hordes as the beasts clambered over city walls and slaughtered innocents.": "在波扎的身边站着米尔加，他早先的背叛已经削弱了他以前的瓦尼尔盟友。为了换取波扎提供的权力，米尔加尔成为她的妃子，并成为失落之地彻底毁灭的设计师。在这场战斗的血腥高潮中，米尔加尔自己的创造物--有长船那么大的野狼、能用她的毒药瓦解对手的筋肉大蛇，以及其他许多人都加入了这场战斗。当这些野兽爬过城墙，屠杀无辜者时，有数十人在这些群狼面前丧生。",
	"I never realized then how far my uncle's blood would run, how deeply it would stain. It was not until after his world took my eye that I truly saw.": "我当时从未意识到我叔叔的血会流得多远，会染得多深。直到他的世界夺走我的眼睛后，我才真正看到。",
	"Seeing the inevitable, Aldyhn (the leader of the Vanir, and niece to Mirgal himself) surged through the enemy lines and challenged her uncle. They fought furiously but Aldyhn's sword arm was powered by her devotion to her people and she overwhelmed Mirgal. But his death was not enough to turn the battle as the Yoten swarmed, like locusts, around her. The end was inevitable.": "看到不可避免的情况，Aldyhn（瓦尼尔人的领袖，也是Mirgal本人的侄女）冲进敌阵，向她的叔叔挑战。他们展开了激烈的战斗，但阿尔迪恩的剑臂被她对人民的奉献精神所驱动，她压倒了米尔加尔。但他的死亡并不足以扭转战局，因为约顿人像蝗虫一样蜂拥而至，围绕着她。结局是不可避免的。",
	"So Aldyhn did the impossible.": "所以阿尔代恩做了不可能的事。",
	"As Mirgal dropped to his knees in defeat, Aldyhn took hold of his spear in one hand, her blade in the other. Within the spear surged the magic her uncle wielded so irresponsibly. She uttered words of conjuring and the world shook as a portal ripped violently open. Aldyhn then slit her uncle's throat with the spear's blade and uttered ancient words.": "当米尔加尔败下阵来时，阿尔迪恩一手握住他的长矛，另一只手握住她的刀。长矛里涌动着她叔叔不负责任地挥舞的魔法。她说出了魔法的话语，世界震动了，一个门户被猛烈地撕开了。然后阿尔迪恩用长矛的刀刃割开了她叔叔的喉咙，并说出了古老的话语。",
	"With these utterances, she sacrificed Mirgal to the forgotten gods that both the Yoten and Vanir worshipped. His dying breath, and the primal magic fueling the portal, birthed a new world. Though the magic seared her flesh, Aldyhn stood strong and ushered the last of the Vanir, and the innocents they protected, into these new lands even as rock and wind, tree and fire, were being formed and shaped before their eyes. As the last of the survivors fled the Lost Lands, Aldyhn did not look back as she stepped into Grimnir.": "通过这些话，她把米尔加尔献给了约顿人和瓦尼尔人都崇拜的被遗忘的神灵。他临死前的呼吸，以及助长传送门的原始魔法，孕育了一个新的世界。尽管魔法灼伤了她的肉体，但阿尔迪恩坚强地将最后的瓦尼尔人和他们所保护的无辜者带入这些新的土地，即使岩石和风、树木和火焰在他们眼前形成和塑造。当最后一批幸存者逃离失落之地时，Aldyhn没有回头，她踏上了Grimnir。",
	"Years pass.": "几年过去了。",
	"Grimnir is a hard land. The north is home to islands covered by ice and snow, battered continuously by frigid winds whereas the lands to the south are inundated with volcanoes and jagged plains of lava rock stretch endlessly. The Serpent Sea weaves between these two harsh extremities encircling the rough and tumble inner continents and an uncountable number of fractured islands. Grimnir was created from Mirgal's sacrifice and it is said that the wizard's guilt and anguish over his treachery and failure is why the world is so impossibly volatile.": "格里姆尼尔是一片艰苦的土地。北部是被冰雪覆盖的岛屿，不断受到寒风的侵袭，而南部的土地则被火山淹没，锯齿状的熔岩平原一望无际。蛇海在这两个严酷的极端之间穿梭，环绕着崎岖不平的内部大陆和难以计数的断裂岛屿。格里姆尼尔是由米尔加尔的牺牲创造出来的，据说这位巫师对自己的背叛和失败感到内疚和痛苦，这就是为什么这个世界如此不稳定的原因。",
	"After the Exodus, the hardy newcomers spread out and the Vanir eventually built their primary keep on the central continent, atop the mysterious mountain they named {@i Turnjfall}. Each year this mountain rises ever taller, still growing, as if determined to reach some point in the sky for reasons not even gods might fathom. At the mountain's summit the Vanir hid Mirgal's {@i rainbow spear}.": "在出埃及记之后，顽强的新移民们分散开来，瓦尼尔人最终在中央大陆上建立了他们的主要堡垒，在他们命名为（%0%）的神秘的山峰之上。每年这座山都在不断地升高，仍在不断地增长，仿佛决心要到达天空中的某个点，其原因连神明都无法理解。在山顶上，瓦尼尔人把米尔加的（%1%）藏了起来。",
	"Once a year, Aldyhn's son, Thonir, climbed the isolated and deadly valleys of Turnjfall to collect the amber apples that sustained the Vanir and provided them with their long lives. During those excursions, he once chanced upon a woman, and fell in love with her. Each year the couple would meet but one particularly cold spring morning, with winter's grip still tight on the land, the woman asked him to bring different apples to the Vanir. Blinded by love, he consented and took them from her to feed to his people.": "每年一次，Aldyhn的儿子Thonir爬上Turnjfall与世隔绝的致命山谷，采集维持Vanir人生命的琥珀苹果，并为他们提供长寿。在这些旅行中，他曾经偶然发现了一个女人，并爱上了她。每年，这对夫妇都会见面，但在一个特别寒冷的春天的早晨，冬天对土地的控制仍然很紧，这个女人要求他把不同的苹果带给瓦尼尔人。他被爱情蒙蔽了双眼，同意从她手中接过苹果，喂给他的人民。",
	"Upon biting into each apple, the other Vanir aged rapidly before Thonir's eyes. Only through the use of a powerful spell did they avert immediate death, but to keep alive, they had to become {@i something else}. Their flesh hardened as each Vanir transformed into a living statue, forever trapped where they took that ill-fated bite. In this form they have remained, for centuries.": "咬下每个苹果后，其他瓦尼尔人在索尼尔的眼前迅速衰老。只有通过使用强大的咒语，他们才避免了立即死亡，但为了保持生命力，他们不得不变得（%0%）。他们的肉体变硬了，每个瓦尼尔都变成了一个活生生的雕像，永远被困在了他们那命运多舛的一口地方。几个世纪以来，他们一直以这种形式存在。",
	"But this story was not yet finished.": "但这个故事还没有结束。",
	"Thonir remained lost in mourning, perhaps for days, until a cold winter's evening when his lover's body was dragged into the clearing and dropped into the snow at his feet. Then his eyes opened, widened in horror. Boða, the foul Yoten that had destroyed the Lost Lands, revealed herself with a hideous snarl. She seized the {@i rainbow spear}, intent on opening a portal to the Lost Lands, to bring her fellow Yoten into Grimnir.": "索尼尔一直迷失在哀悼中，也许有好几天，直到一个寒冷的冬天的晚上，他爱人的尸体被拖进空地，掉进他脚下的雪地里。然后他的眼睛睁开了，惊恐地睁大了。Boða，那个摧毁了失落之地的肮脏的Yoten，带着狰狞的咆哮显露出来。她抓住了{@i rainbow spear}，打算打开一个通往失落之地的入口，把她的同伴Yoten带到Grimnir。",
	"It was not to be.": "这是不可能的。",
	"The young warrior rose and took hold of a magical scythe as he leapt at Boða. There, before the blind gaze of his mother, his friends, his allies, he fought with a furious frenzy. Such a great blow did he land on the spear that he sundered the magical artifact into many pieces. Boða shrieked and flung herself at Thonir. The two, the last of the Vanir and the last of the Yoten, fought a final, epic battle that left both mortally wounded. They died together, their life blood staining the snowy fields of Grimnir.": "年轻的战士站了起来，握着一把神奇的镰刀，向博萨跃去。在他的母亲、朋友和盟友的盲目注视下，他狂热地战斗着。他对长矛进行了如此巨大的打击，以至于将这把神奇的神器打成了许多碎片。波扎尖叫着扑向索尼尔。这两个人，最后的瓦尼尔人和最后的约顿人，进行了最后的史诗般的战斗，使他们都受了致命的伤。他们同归于尽，他们的鲜血染红了格里姆尼尔的雪原。",
	"Upon both their deaths, a great storm of primal magic swept across Grimnir. The Vanir, though trapped in stone, were imbued with divinity, transformed into the gods now known as the Stone Court. Thonir's lover also changed rising from death but descending into the bowels of the world to become the caretaker of those that die from unjust means... the Lady of the Dead, a being that all raiders respect, but few worship.": "在他们两人死亡后，一场巨大的原始魔法风暴席卷了整个格里姆尼尔。瓦尼尔人虽然被困在石头里，却被赋予了神性，变成了现在被称为石庭的诸神。索尼尔的爱人也发生了变化，从死亡中站了起来，但降到了世界的深处，成为那些死于不公正手段的人的看护者......亡灵女士，一个所有突袭者都尊重的存在，但很少有人崇拜。",
	"And of Thonir himself?": "索尼尔本人呢？",
	"The raiders believe he sits in the fabled Halls of the Slain feasting, drinking, and training the bravest of raider warriors who have ever died in battle. He presides over the valkry, the winged warrior women who bring the worthy dead to the halls. When a new evil rises to threaten Grimnir, Thonir and the dead legends from the past, it is said, shall return to defend the people.": "突击队员们相信他坐在传说中的 \"死者大厅 \"里吃喝玩乐，并训练那些曾经死在战场上的最勇敢的突击队员们。他主持瓦尔克里的工作，这些长着翅膀的女战士将有价值的死者带到大厅里。当一个新的邪恶势力崛起，威胁到格里姆尼尔的时候，索尼尔和过去死去的传奇人物，据说会回来保卫人民。",
	"And so, it shall be.": "因此，它将是。",
	"I watched them die, so many of them. The Vanir, those great heroes, who bumped me on their knees, watched my first steps, and taught a stripling youth his first sword swings. The end of a legacy... no words quite capture the terribleness of it all. More than one world died that day.": "我看着他们死去，那么多的人。瓦尼尔人，那些伟大的英雄们，他们用膝盖撞我，看着我迈出第一步，并教一个初出茅庐的年轻人第一次挥剑。一个遗产的终结......没有任何语言能完全捕捉到这一切的可怕之处。那一天，不止一个世界死去。",
	"The pieces of the {@i rainbow spear} have been scattered, hidden, and protected by the raider clans since those early days. The völv have prophesied that if the spear were ever to be made whole again, it shall signal Grimnir's violent end. This has not deterred some from attempting the feat.": "从早期开始，{@i rainbow spear}的碎片就被分散、隐藏起来，并被突袭者家族所保护。沃尔夫人曾预言，如果长矛能够再次完整，那将预示着格里姆尼尔的暴力终结。这并没有阻止一些人去尝试这一壮举。",
	"The raiders are not the only mortal dominions in Grimnir. There are also the Baendur kingdoms. These peoples build their towns deep within the forests and hills of various islands dotting the Serpent Sea. They have learned not to invite the attention of the raiders and for the most part have kept to themselves. But not always.": "突袭者并不是格里姆尼尔唯一的凡人统治者。还有巴恩杜尔王国。这些人把他们的城镇建在森林深处和点缀在蛇海中的各个岛屿的山丘上。他们已经学会了不去招惹突袭者的注意，在大多数情况下，他们都保持着自我。但并非总是如此。",
	"Three centuries ago, a wanderer emerged from the ironwood forests that grow along the northern shores of Turnjfall. Giant-like in stature and covered completely in living armor harvested from those eldritch trees, he called himself the Witchking and forced the Baendur to bend their knee to him. He united them and waged war upon the raiders. It became clear that his intent was to recover the pieces of the rainbow spear and through many bloody skirmishes he claimed several.": "三个世纪前，一个流浪者从生长在Turnjfall北岸的铁木林中走出来。他身材魁梧，全身覆盖着从那些长生树上采来的活生生的盔甲，他自称是巫妖王，强迫巴恩杜尔人向他屈膝。他将他们联合起来，向突袭者发动了战争。很明显，他的目的是要收回彩虹长矛的碎片，通过许多血腥的小规模冲突，他夺取了一些碎片。",
	"Only by uniting, were the raider clans able to overthrow the Witchking and end his influence on the Baendur. In so doing they seriously diminished the power that those inner kingdoms once wielded. The raiders called this first coming together the Gathering. And though the clans are still at strife with one another into modern times, the Gathering is held every eighth year. It is one of the most important elements holding raider society together.": "只有通过联合，突袭者部族才能推翻巫妖王，结束他对巴恩杜尔的影响。这样一来，他们严重削弱了那些内部王国曾经拥有的权力。突击队员们把这第一次聚会称为 \"聚会\"。尽管进入现代，各部族之间仍有纷争，但集会每八年举行一次。它是维系突击队员社会的最重要因素之一。",

Over the centuries many have arrived, telling a tale of being drawn from their own world in a flash of light only to find themselves alone on a coast of jagged black rock, or stuck waist-deep in a snow dune, or suddenly fighting for their life in the waters of the frigid Serpent Sea. How many countless others have not lived long enough to tell this tale? Trapped in some desolate wilderness, lingering days, weeks, till the cold, the hunger, or the jagged teeth of a prowling beast, ends their miserable life? That is a story to worry any soul on a cold winter's evening.": "有些人是野兽，值得敬畏、战斗和杀戮；有些人是新来者。几个世纪以来，许多人来到这里，讲述了这样一个故事：他们在一束光中被从自己的世界吸引过来，却发现自己孤独地站在嶙峋的黑岩海岸上，或者被困在齐腰深的雪丘中，或者突然在寒冷的蛇海水域中为自己的生命而战。还有多少人没有活到足够长的时间来讲述这个故事？被困在某个荒凉的旷野中，徘徊数日，数周，直到寒冷，饥饿，或者游荡的野兽的锯齿，结束他们悲惨的生命？这是一个在寒冷的冬天的夜晚让人担心的故事。",

	"Thonir's lover of old is now known as Hel and she resides in the Underworld. She is worshipped by few (and feared by many). Yet she is not a cruel being, Hel simply hates to see suffering.

The more that join her in the Underworld, the less suffering remains in the mortal world.": "索尼尔以前的情人现在被称为赫尔，她居住在冥界。她受到少数人的崇拜（也有很多人害怕）。然而她并不是一个残忍的存在，赫尔只是讨厌看到痛苦。但她的同情心并不意味着她试图帮助活人。相反，她认为冥界是一个避难所，在那里没有人需要再感受到痛苦。在冥界加入她的人越多，凡间的痛苦就越少。",

	"Thonir, son of Aldyhn, was one of the Vanir. Though tricked into undermining the Stone Court, he redeemed himself by slaying Boða.

	"On an island in the center of a lake stand the statues of the gods, as well as an altar.

	"To die with a weapon in hand is the near zealous goal of every proud raider. It is known that those that are battle slain, and then offered to the night sky with the burning of a pyre, will be taken to the {@i Halls of the Slain}.

	"Raiders that die of natural causes or plague or the like are buried in the earth. It is believed that the Lady of the Dead claims those dead.

	"Warfare at sea comes with an additional risk. The worst of all deaths, the raiders believe, is to fall into the sea. The living will try hard to recover the bodies of their fallen allies from the frigid waters of the Serpent Sea, so that they may be honored properly. Otherwise they become corpsefood for the great serpent that lingers in the deepest waters of the sea and are denied an afterlife entirely. Instead they return as smaller sea snakes that are known to foul fisher nets or drag children from the seashore.": "海上的战争伴随着额外的风险。突击队员们认为，所有死亡中最糟糕的是坠入海中。活着的人将努力从蛇海冰冷的水中打捞出他们死去的盟友的尸体，以便他们可以得到适当的尊重。否则，他们就会成为徘徊在海的最深处的大蛇的尸体食物，完全被剥夺了来世。相反，他们会以较小的海蛇形式返回，众所周知，这些海蛇会弄脏渔民的渔网，或从海边拖走孩子。",
	"Among all peoples of Grimnir there is a belief in a magical world that exists just out of sight. Fey creatures are thought to occupy this parallel world and some spellcasters insist they draw their power from it.

Though their martial traditions are most important to them they also pride themselves on shipbuilding, farming, trading, and respecting their gods through their divine traditions.": "袭击者是务实的人，重视力量和勇敢。他们对自己的祖先--瓦尼尔人怀有极大的敬意。虽然他们的武术传统对他们来说是最重要的，但他们也以造船、耕作、贸易为荣，并通过神圣的传统尊重他们的神灵。",
	"Originally a unified people, as their populations grew the clans expanded, and with that expansion divisions and competition arose. The Hallharn, Tvar and Lutans were the first clans to form and from them, centuries later, sprang the Knattle and the Örn, as well as others that have since fallen or been folded back into existing clans. Additionally, several decades ago, the {@i tallfolk} formed a clan, called the Risa, along the southern coast of Turnjfall.": "原本是一个统一的民族，随着人口的增长，部族也在不断扩大，并随着扩大而产生了分裂和竞争。Hallharn、Tvar和Lutans是最早形成的部族，几个世纪后，从他们那里产生了Knattle和Örn，以及其他一些后来衰落或被折回现有部族的部族。此外，几十年前，{@i tallfolk}在Turnjfall的南岸形成了一个名为Risa的部族。",
	"Today, the raiders live in small and medium sized clans, primarily in wooden fortresses inhabiting the coastal fringe of the inner continents and surrounding islands. The clans are often in conflict, if not outright war with one another.": "今天，突击队员们生活在中小型部族中，主要是居住在内大陆和周围岛屿的沿海边缘的木制堡垒中。这些部族之间经常发生冲突，甚至是直接的战争。",
	"Their history is primarily passed orally from generation to generation, which grants much respect to their elders who are stewards of knowledge. Hence, the raiders value the words of the völv, who have taken a leading role in guiding the clans towards being a more cohesive whole.": "他们的历史主要是通过口头方式代代相传，这使他们对作为知识管理者的长者非常尊重。因此，突击队员们很重视沃尔夫人的言论，他们在指导各部族成为一个更有凝聚力的整体方面发挥了主导作用。",
	"Raiders live every day to its fullest. They eat, drink, and fight, with all they have. Celebration whether it is a victory, a birth, or an alliance is important. But even still, they are not wasteful or foolish. The chieftains, known as {@i jarls}, are cautious with the lives of their warriors. Each raider is highly trained, and their numbers are few; risks are weighed carefully.": "突击队员每天都过得很充实。他们吃喝玩乐，打打杀杀，倾其所有。庆祝活动无论是胜利、出生，还是结盟都很重要。但即使如此，他们也不浪费，不愚昧。被称为{@i jarls}的首领们对他们的战士的生命很谨慎。每个突击队员都受过严格的训练，他们的人数很少；风险被仔细权衡。",
	"Raiders relish gaining spoils their reward in the present life for their bravery in battle. These include weapons, armor, coins, as well as thralls. But most warriors are also farmers or fishers and look to expand their land holdings by acquiring new properties that they can farm or fish upon. Wealth takes many forms among the raiders.": "突击队员喜欢获得战利品，作为他们在战斗中的英勇表现在现世的回报。这些战利品包括武器、盔甲、钱币以及王室成员。但大多数战士也是农民或渔民，他们希望通过获得新的财产来扩大他们的土地持有量，以便他们可以在上面耕种或捕鱼。突击队员的财富有多种形式。",
	"Above all, joining their ancestors in the {@i Halls of the Slain} is their most valued prize.": "最重要的是，与他们的祖先一起参加（%0%）是他们最看重的奖品。",
	"Thralls are the prisoners the raiders capture after a battle  either from other clans or the Baendur. They become part of an individual warrior's household and are never permitted to touch a weapon unless the family adopts them formally. When this happens, the thrall becomes a member of the clan; their past (mostly) forgotten.": "鲛人是突袭者在战斗后从其他部族或巴恩杜尔人那里捕获的囚犯。他们成为单个战士家庭的一部分，除非家族正式收养他们，否则永远不允许接触武器。当这种情况发生时，被俘者就成为该部族的一员；他们的过去（大部分）被遗忘。",
	"This massive river separates the High North and the Fanged Sands from the inner continent and forms a complete loop with itself. Fed by the waterfalls that continuously pour down from the mountain, Turnjfall, the raiders have come to accept the Serpent Sea as a creature in its own right. For no reason other than avarice, the river has been known to change the direction of its flow, at times slowing a fleet of raider vessels and giving their raiding target time to prepare, at other times allowing an enemy to catch a fleeing longship that otherwise might have escaped.": "这条巨大的河流将北方高地和獠牙沙地与内部大陆分开，并与自己形成一个完整的循环。由Turnjfall山不断倾泻而下的瀑布提供水源，突击队员们已经接受了蛇海作为其自身的一种生物。除了贪婪之外，这条河流还经常改变其流向，有时会减缓突袭者船队的速度，让他们的突袭目标有时间准备，有时则会让敌人抓住一艘逃跑的长船，否则就会逃之夭夭。",
	"This Serpent Sea encircles a mass of land that rises vertically, with its highest peak in the east. Though the lowlands, known simply as the {@i Inner Lands}, are fertile and inhabited by many clans, the mountain, called Turnjfall is seldom explored. Visible from almost every other location in the world, Turnjfall's cliffs are sheer granite, unscalable, and the only upward passage is to ascend from the {@i Inner Lands}, along the western flank. Yet the daunting forests, and the creatures lurking within, discourage most from even dreaming of the attempt. That, and the many missing clans that have tried to settle deeper. No fewer than three are known to have perished. A few raiders tell tales of mysterious beasts living among those untouched forests, stalking any who stray into their woods. Some villages on the fringes of such forests even perform sacrifices to keep the beasts from straying from their woods.": "这片蛇海环绕着一片垂直上升的土地，其最高峰在东部。虽然低地，简单地称为（%0%），很肥沃，有很多部族居住，但被称为Turnjfall的山却很少有人去探索。从世界上几乎所有其他地方都可以看到，特恩瀑布的悬崖是纯粹的花岗岩，无法攀登，唯一的上升通道是从西侧的（%1%）上升。然而，令人生畏的森林和潜伏在其中的生物，使大多数人连做梦都不敢尝试。这一点，以及许多试图在更深处定居的失踪部族。已知有不少于三个部族已经灭亡。一些袭击者讲述了生活在那些未开发的森林中的神秘野兽的故事，它们跟踪任何误入森林的人。在这些森林边缘的一些村庄甚至进行祭祀，以防止野兽从他们的森林里走出来。",
	"Volcanoes occasionally erupt from the volatile strip of land that forms the world's southern edge. Lava rock has accumulated and stretches for miles, a vast plain of desolation. From this world's edge, the land slopes upwards, northward, until it reaches the lakes, rivers, and more fertile lands bordering the Serpent Sea.": "火山偶尔会从构成世界南部边缘的动荡地带喷发出来。熔岩堆积，绵延数英里，是一片广阔的荒凉平原。从这个世界的边缘，土地向上倾斜，向北延伸，直到到达湖泊、河流和与蛇海相邻的更肥沃的土地。",
	"The Tower of Kekkell is located on the coast of the Fanged Sands, and Nowhere, the largest community composed of lesser raiding clans, collectively known as the {@i varang} is in the south east.": "凯凯尔之塔位于獠牙沙地的海岸上，而由较小的突击部族组成的最大社区--无名氏，统称为（%0%）位于东南部。",
	"Visited the old Baendur kingdoms, before the Witchking, I did. Beautiful castles they had, but their ruins belong to the Lutan and Tvar now. Those raider lands were the Baendur homeland once, but they spread themselves thin, that is truth. Wars were lost and their middle faltered, kept only the appendages, if you understand.": "在巫妖王之前，我访问了旧的Baendur王国。他们有美丽的城堡，但他们的废墟现在属于卢坦人和特瓦人。那些突袭者的土地曾经是巴恩杜尔人的故乡，但他们把自己分散了，这就是事实。战争失败了，他们的中坚力量动摇了，只保留了附属物，如果你明白的话。",
	"Though not the dominant political force in the land, several dozen small kingdoms are scattered across the world. Loosely connected, more by philosophy than direct connections, the kingdoms should not be considered a single cohesive whole. There is only the occasional migration between them and the rare royal marriage of kingdoms situated geographically near one another.": "虽然不是这片土地上的主导政治力量，但有几十个小王国散布在世界各地。这些王国之间联系松散，更多的是通过哲学而非直接联系，不应该被认为是一个单一的凝聚整体。它们之间只有偶尔的迁徙，以及地理上彼此接近的王国之间罕见的皇家联姻。",
	"The closest to an axis of power that exists is Cenric Edgare's family. His bloodline is believed to have originated with the Witchking himself, but Edgare, like all Baendur, now realize it is important to avoid the raiders. Drawing their attention is to invite ruin. That is not to say there is never the occasional war between the kingdoms themselves; in the west there have been numerous conflicts even in recent years.": "最接近于权力轴心的存在是塞尼克-埃德加尔的家族。他的血统被认为起源于巫妖王本人，但埃德加尔和所有巴恩杜尔人一样，现在意识到避开突袭者很重要。引起他们的注意就是招致毁灭。这并不是说王国之间从来不会有偶尔的战争；在西部，甚至在最近几年也有许多冲突。",
	"Note. Baendur means, \"Sinks Fast\" in the dialect of the raiders.": "注意。在突击队员的方言中，Baendur的意思是 \"快速下沉\"。",
	"These fertile lands have remained in the Baendur's hands owing to the formidable defenses of the inner kingdoms, the natural fortifications provided by the Winefrost mountains, and the raiders lack of knowledge of the continent's geography.": "这些肥沃的土地一直在巴恩杜尔人手中，这是因为内部王国强大的防御力，温冻山脉提供的天然防御工事，以及袭击者缺乏对大陆地理的了解。",
	"The lava plains that dominate the southern and eastern stretches of the world give way to slightly more forested areas and some farmyard, though not as bountiful as the Western Shores. The kingdoms that exist here are poorer and less organized than in the west.": "主导世界南部和东部的熔岩平原让位于稍多的森林地区和一些农田，尽管不像西部海岸那样富饶。这里存在的王国比西部地区更贫穷，更没有组织。",
	"The borderlands in the north range from evergreen forests, with sufficient game to support clans such as the Whar (as well as some of the Baendur kingdoms) to vast plains of ice, upon which the hardy Knattle raiders eke out a brutalist existence, competing with, and exploiting the mammoth and wooly rhinoceros that roam there. A few northern temples, their former occupants unknown, are occasionally found by stalwart explorers.": "北方的边境地区从常绿森林到广阔的冰原，那里有足够的猎物来支持像沃尔（以及一些巴恩杜尔王国）这样的部族，在那里，坚韧的克纳特（Knattle）突击队员靠着野蛮的生存方式，与漫山遍野的猛犸象和毛犀牛竞争并加以利用。顽强的探险家们偶尔会发现一些北方的神庙，它们以前的居住者不详。",
	"My sister, Berghild, and I often snuck out of our farmhouse and waited in the fields, to watch the tomten take food from a plate we set out our ship mead from our mothers' thimbles. But always our eyelids became heavy and we fell asleep instead of seeing. Yet the food was gone, the mead drank, whenever we did wake.": "我的姐姐贝尔希尔德和我经常溜出我们的农舍，在田野里等着，看汤姆森从我们摆出的盘子里拿食物，我们从母亲的顶针里拿出船用蜂蜜酒。但我们的眼皮总是变得很沉重，我们没有看到，而是睡着了。然而，每当我们醒来的时候，食物就不见了，蜂蜜酒也喝了。",
	"And to watch our mothers at work, the two of them talking to the tomten, as if they truly were there, making the forge hammers strike harder. It is just respect, I guess, to speak to them. Just because we can't see them doesn't mean they are not there.": "看着我们的母亲在工作，她们两个人对着汤姆顿说话，好像她们真的在那里，让锻造锤子更用力地敲击。我想，对他们说话只是一种尊重。我们看不到他们，并不意味着他们不在那里。",
	"The Hallharn were one of the original clans, formed centuries ago, and their primary settlement, {@i Hallwik}, rests in the {@i Bay of Sighs}.

	"In general, a killing, outside of warfare, for no valid reason, can be tried by the jarl of either the victim or the aggressor.

	"Failure to take or honor the oath results in the transgressor suffering the curse of the exile.": "如果不宣誓或不履行誓言，违约者将遭受流亡的诅咒。",
	"In times of trouble even rival clans must come together. When needed, a group will swear fellowship to one another and promise to defend each other, share glory and spoils, and to never act against the other. At least while the terms of the fellowship are valid.": "在遇到困难的时候，即使是敌对的部族也必须走到一起。在需要的时候，一个团体会彼此宣誓结为兄弟，并承诺互相保卫，分享荣耀和战利品，并且永远不对对方采取行动。至少在团契条款有效的时候。",

	"When wronged, a raider's wrath knows no limits. A raider may declare a {@i bloodvow} against an enemy that has insulted or injured them. This is a ritual, but one undertaken by the wronged raider, alone. Often the ritual involves a long rest in the deep woods and an offering of their blood or flesh to Grimnir. The GM will decide the actual benefits and drawbacks of this oath, but the following provides examples:": "当受到委屈时，突击队员的愤怒是无止境的。突袭者可以对侮辱或伤害过他们的敌人宣布（%0%）。这是一种仪式，但却是由受委屈的突击队员单独进行的。通常情况下，这个仪式包括在深山老林中长期休息，并将他们的血液或肉体献给Grimnir。GM将决定这个誓言的实际好处和坏处，但下面提供了一些例子。",
	"{@b Words Have Power.} The more specific a vow, the more power it holds. Declaring, \"I shall slay every raider of the Tvar Clan\", might merit a +1 to all attack rolls against Tvar clansfolk. Uttering instead, \"I shall kill Gunthur of the Tvar\" might merit a +3 to all attack rolls against Gunthur. \"I shall kill Gunthur of the Tvar by the next full moon\" could merit +3 to attack rolls and +3 to damage against Gunthur himself.": "{@b Words Have Power.} 誓言越具体，它的力量就越大。宣称 \"我将杀死每一个特瓦尔家族的突袭者\"，可能会使所有针对特瓦尔家族成员的攻击卷得到+1。而宣称 \"我将杀死特瓦族的冈瑟\"，可能会使所有针对冈瑟的攻击卷得到+3。\"我将在下一个满月前杀死Tvar的Gunthur \"可能会使对Gunthur本人的攻击卷轴+3和伤害+3。",
	"{@b Flesh Has Power.} The benefit of the oath can be increased with a sacrifice of flesh. A finger or toe might grant advantage against the first attack against the targeted foe(s). A hand or eye might grant disadvantage to all attacks from the named enemy.": "{@b Flesh Has Power.} 誓约的好处可以通过牺牲肉体来增加。一根手指或脚趾可能对目标敌人的第一次攻击给予优势。一只手或眼睛可能会对来自指定敌人的所有攻击产生不利影响。",
	"{@b Retribution Knows No Rest.} Any exhaustion (no matter the source) during the fulfillment of the oath is ignored with a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw.": "{@b Retribution Knows No Rest.}在履行誓言的过程中，任何疲惫(不管是什么原因)都会被忽略，只要成功地进行DC12体质测试。",
	"{@b Time Has Limits.} There must be a time limit (no more than a year) and if that limit expires and vengeance has not been obtained, the raider suffers the curse of failed promises.": "{@b Time Has Limits.}必须有一个时间限制（不超过一年），如果这个时间限制过了，而复仇还没有得到，突袭者就会受到失败承诺的诅咒。",
	"As with oaths, some curses are enforced by mortals and others by the gods and powers of the world.": "与誓言一样，有些诅咒是由凡人执行的，有些则是由神和世界的力量执行的。",
	"This curse is enacted by other mortals. The cursed raider becomes marked by all other raiders, who must now ignore them. The cursed will be treated as if they have already died and no one will shelter, feed, or defend them. This curse guarantees exile or a death, albeit a slow one.": "这个诅咒是由其他凡人颁布的。被诅咒的突击队员会被所有其他突击队员标记，他们现在必须无视他们。被诅咒的人将被视为已经死亡，没有人会庇护、喂养或保护他们。这个诅咒保证流放或死亡，尽管是缓慢的死亡。",
	"A broken vow can often lead to the disapproval of the Stone Court itself. The cursed immediately suffers one permanent level of exhaustion (able to only be removed by the casting of a {@spell greater restoration|PHB} spell, on eight consecutive days) and a sacrifice of flesh no smaller than a finger. Unless removed, another level of exhaustion is gained every eight days. A character that dies of this curse arises as a {@b draugr} under the control of the game master.": "违背誓言往往会导致石器法庭本身的不认可。被诅咒的人立即遭受一个永久性的疲惫等级（只能通过连续八天施放（%0%）的咒语来消除）和一个不比手指小的肉体牺牲。除非消除，否则每八天就会获得另一级的疲惫。死于此诅咒的角色会在游戏主人的控制下变成一个（%1%）。",
	"Once there was a world, another world, what we call the Lost Lands. All know the story of Mirgal and his folly. His vanity, deviousness, and longing for power doomed the Lost Lands. Mirgal brought about the end. Yet Aldyhn, in her infinitely growing wisdom, understood how he might also become a beginning.": "曾经有一个世界，另一个世界，我们称之为失落之地。所有人都知道米尔加尔的故事和他的愚蠢行为。他的虚荣、狡诈和对权力的渴望注定了失落之地的毁灭。米格尔带来了灭顶之灾。然而，Aldyhn，以她无限增长的智慧，明白他也可能成为一个开始。",
	"As she conjured the magnificent rainbow portal, she pierced Mirgal again and again. Blood sprayed, covering her, the spear, and ultimately spilling into the void. That blood was transmogrified by the power of the portal and it proliferated. There, on the other side, it simmered and bubbled, a vast sea of crimson. Her next strokes were precise, bits of flesh that twisted, coiled, and grew, wrapping around, twisting against, that sea of blood. The two flesh and blood; land and sea fought the first wars between them, struggling to find a balance. The largest chunk of flesh became the Inner Lands, smaller bits the other continents, and the smallest flesh pieces became the uncountable islands of the Serpent Sea.": "当她幻化出宏伟的彩虹门户时，她一次又一次地刺穿米尔加尔。鲜血喷洒，覆盖了她和长矛，并最终洒向虚空。这些血被传送门的力量转化，并扩散开来。在那里，在另一边，它酝酿和冒泡，成为一片巨大的深红色海洋。她的下一步是精确的，肉体的碎片扭曲、盘绕、生长，缠绕在血海上，扭曲着。两个血肉之躯；陆地和海洋在它们之间进行了第一次战争，挣扎着寻找平衡。最大的一块肉变成了内陆，更小的肉变成了其他大陆，而最小的肉块则变成了蛇海中数不清的岛屿。",
	"And yet, despite these gruesome wounds, Mirgal still lived. His life light dimming in his eyes, she struck him again and again. His leg and arm bones became the great mountain Turnjfall. Other bones became smaller mountain ranges and his shattered teeth the numerous boulders dotting Grimnir. Her death stroke parted his head from his shoulders and all his body was cast through, torn and shredded and repurposed to become a living land to shelter those he had failed.": "然而，尽管有这些可怕的伤痕，米尔加尔仍然活着。他的生命之光在他的眼中渐渐黯淡，她一次又一次地打击着他。他的腿和胳膊的骨头变成了大山Turnjfall。其他的骨头变成了更小的山脉，而他破碎的牙齿则变成了点缀在格里姆尼尔的无数巨石。她的死亡一击将他的头和肩膀分开，他所有的身体都被抛了出去，被撕裂，被撕碎，被重新利用，成为一块活生生的土地，以庇护那些他所失败的人。",
	"Only his head did Aldyhn leave behind. For nothing could be gained, she reckoned, from bringing his cunning into this new world.": "Aldyhn只留下了他的头。她认为，把他的狡猾带到这个新的世界里，不会有任何收获。",
	"Though she had technically created the world, Aldyhn found it a strange place. The air she inhaled tasted of her uncle's breath and the touching of a tree or stone reminded her of when Mirgal used to rest his hand on her shoulder, offering comfort to a niece he once loved. Mirgal seemed a part of this new world and, at night, she suffered, plagued by dreams, by torments.": "虽然从技术上讲，她创造了这个世界，但Aldyhn发现这是个奇怪的地方。她吸入的空气有她叔叔呼吸的味道，触摸一棵树或一块石头都会让她想起米尔加尔曾经把手放在她的肩膀上，向他曾经爱过的侄女提供安慰。米尔格尔似乎是这个新世界的一部分，而在夜里，她受尽折磨，被梦境和折磨所困扰。",
	"After the early colonies were established, Aldyhn took her son Thonir, still not quite a man himself, and the two boarded a small boat called a faering. Her intention was to map some part of the world to better understand it. Maybe even to convince herself that it was not more than just her uncle's body living on after his death.": "早期殖民地建立后，阿尔迪恩带着她的儿子索尼尔，他自己还没有完全成年，两人登上了一艘叫做faering的小船。她的意图是绘制世界的某些部分，以便更好地了解它。也许甚至是为了说服自己，这不仅仅是她叔叔死后的身体在继续生存。",
	"Regardless, she and Thonir had several adventures as they sailed and rowed their way across the Serpent Sea and up many of the rivers feeding into it or siphoning from it. One such was when they discovered a passage into the mountains of Turnjfall and founded the Stone Court. But that is not this story.": "不管怎么说，她和索尼尔在航行和划船的过程中经历了几次冒险，他们穿越了蛇海，并沿着许多注入蛇海或从蛇海抽出的河流前进。其中一次是他们发现了一条进入特恩瀑布山脉的通道，并建立了石庭。但这并不是这个故事。",
	"Instead, on a cloudy day they headed east, but kept the coasts of the many scattered northern islands always in view. An island, no more remarkable than any other, nonetheless caught her attention and she drifted nearer it, ultimately landing to make camp for the night. Though spring was several weeks underway there was still snow covering the ground. Her campfire made short work of it (and the chill air) and underneath their sleeping furs, inside their hide tent, they slept.": "相反，在一个多云的日子里，他们向东走去，但始终保持着许多分散的北方岛屿的海岸线的视野。有一个岛屿，并不比其他任何岛屿更引人注目，但还是引起了她的注意，她渐渐靠近了它，最终登陆扎营过夜。虽然春天已经过去了几个星期，但地面上仍有积雪。她的篝火很快就解决了它（和寒冷的空气），在他们的皮毛下，在他们的皮帐篷里，他们睡着了。",
	"Yet Aldyhn woke to a moonless night sky, the stars crisp and twinkling above her.": "然而，Aldyhn在没有月亮的夜空中醒来，星星在她头上清脆地闪烁着。",
	"\"Aldyhn,\" her uncle's whisper traveled across the wind, startling her. His voice seemed to come from the north and she chased after it. She was after all Aldyhn of the Vanir; what else would such as she do in such a situation?": "\"Aldyhn，\"她叔叔的低语在风中穿梭，把她吓了一跳。他的声音似乎来自北方，她追了过去。她毕竟是瓦尼尔人的Aldyhn；在这种情况下，像她这样的人还能做什么？",
	"She found a trail into the hills and, at its end, a grove and a pool of water that was warm to her touch. Steam rose from it, forming land clouds that made it hard to see, made it hard for the outer world to intrude on the inner. She sat near the pool and her uncle's whispers drifted away. She stared into the waters.": "她发现了一条进入山丘的小路，在小路的尽头，有一片小树林和一池水，她摸起来很温暖。蒸汽从水中升起，形成陆地上的云，使人难以看清，使外部世界难以侵入内部。她坐在池边，她叔叔的低语渐渐远去。她凝视着水面。",
	"But she did not understand. She did not see. Hours passed and she never even worried about Thonir, her son asleep and alone in the wild. She did not think of the Lost Lands, not of her dead husband, or the many friends she had lost. She thought of nothing other than that she knew she was not really {@i seeing}.": "但她不明白。她没有看到。几个小时过去了，她甚至没有担心过索尼尔，她的儿子在野外孤独地睡着。她没有想到失落之地，没有想到她死去的丈夫，也没有想到她失去的许多朋友。她除了知道自己不是真的（%0%）之外，什么也没想过。",
	"The blindness frustrated her such that she drove her dagger into her own face and carved out her left eye. She gave it as an offering to the old gods that the Vanir were already beginning to forget. And when she did, she finally saw. Later, she would talk of it often, never the details, but the change. Losing her eye gave her a view of the past, the present, and the future.": "失明让她很沮丧，她把匕首刺进自己的脸，挖出了自己的左眼。她把它作为祭品献给瓦尼尔人已经开始遗忘的旧神。当她这样做时，她终于看到了。后来，她经常谈及此事，从不谈及细节，而是谈及变化。失去眼睛让她看到了过去、现在和未来。",
	"Aldyhn would revisit the island regularly over the years and eventually built a temple there. A temple that to this day is still inhabited by the völv, the order of seers of which Aldyhn was the first.": "多年来，Aldyhn会定期访问该岛，并最终在那里建立了一座寺庙。这座寺庙至今仍由沃尔夫人居住着，沃尔夫人是预言家协会的成员，而阿尔迪恩则是第一位。",
	"I woke in the midst of night to see a one-eyed stranger standing over me. Colored lightning flashed in the sky and she seemed of another world. And yet. She was my mother, Aldyhn. But not quite. Not quite ever the same. I vowed never to return to that island, never to visit that cursed Well of Wisdom.": "我在黑夜中醒来，看到一个独眼的陌生人站在我头上。彩色的闪电在天空中闪现，她似乎来自另一个世界。然而。她是我的母亲，Aldyhn。但不完全是。不太一样了。我发誓再也不回那个岛了，再也不去那个被诅咒的智慧之井了。",
	"This section describes how to build heroes for {@i Raiders of the Serpent Sea}. First decide where your hero is from. You have a couple choices. Heroes from other worlds have been brought to Grimnir many times over the centuries, but after a generation or two they tend to assimilate into the various cultures.

However, a hero from among the raiders has a stronger reason to save the world and may be more rewarding to play.": "本节介绍了如何为{@i Raiders of the Serpent Sea}建立英雄。首先决定你的英雄来自哪里。你有几个选择。几个世纪以来，来自其他世界的英雄多次被带到Grimnir，但经过一两代人的努力，他们往往会被各种文化同化。真正的新来者很少，但仍有可能。然而，来自突袭者中的英雄有更强的理由来拯救世界，可能会更有价值。",

Usually.": "人类、精灵、地精、半身人、半兽人、龙裔和铁弗林都是最初从失落之地来到Grimnir的定居者。经过几代人的努力，这些种族的其他人也找到了他们的方式，并加入了现有的社会。虽然部族倾向于以一个种族为主，但他们对大多数人都是开放的。一个人做什么比他是什么更重要。通常情况下。",

	"Family lineage within the raider clans is important. The raiders commonly provide given names to their children and the family name consists of the mother or father's name (whomever has the greater {@i glory} when the child is born). To this name the suffix {@i loke} is added until the child is of age to identify as male ({@i askr}) or female ({@i emb}). Many chose to retain {@i loke}.

	"Regardless, newcomers also must become familiar with the customs and oaths of their new lands.

	"The world of Grimnir is rich in many metals but the raiders lost much of their mining and smithing knowledge during the Exodus.

	"Glory is held by the individual and should be tracked by each player and the game master. However, if the {@i {@link Oath of Fellowship|https://5e.tools/book.html#rotsspgf,2,oath%20of%20fellowship} has been sworn, it reduces how low a heroes' glory can fall. When losing glory points, the hero cannot fall below the lowest glory level of the other party members. This makes wagering glory during a boast less risky. However... any time {@i any} party member loses any glory, all other party members lose one glory.": "荣耀是由个人持有的，应该由每个玩家和游戏主人跟踪。然而，如果{@i {@link Oath of Fellowship|https://5e.tools/book.html#rotsspgf,2,oath%20of%20fellowship}已经宣誓，它就会减少英雄的荣耀值可以下降的程度。当失去荣耀点时，英雄不能低于其他党派成员的最低荣耀水平。这使得在吹嘘期间赌注荣耀的风险降低。然而......任何时候{@i any}党员失去任何荣耀，所有其他党员都会失去一个荣耀。",
	"You are known by name at feasting halls near your first remarkable achievements.": "在你第一次取得显著成就附近的宴会厅里，你的名字被人所知。",
	"As long as you tell a story, any feasting hall associated with your clan will provide drink and food for free. However, your deeds annoy nonraiders and you have disadvantage on Intimidation or Persuasion attempts against the Baendur.": "只要你讲一个故事，任何与你的部族有关的宴会厅都会免费提供饮料和食物。然而，你的行为会惹恼非袭击者，你在对巴恩杜尔人进行恐吓或劝说的尝试中处于劣势。",

	"Your crew has composed a variety of poetic songs about your exploits. When performed in front of you, they are always uplifting... those they sing behind your back tend to favor your missteps. Regardless, you are beginning to become known as the \"Heroes of...\" (See Epithets, below)": "你的队员们为你的事迹创作了各种诗意的歌曲。在你面前表演时，它们总是令人振奋......而在你背后唱的则倾向于你的错误行为。不管怎么说，你们已经开始被称为\"......的英雄\"（见下文的称呼）。",

	"Glory we seek, isn't it so? We raiders, we take to the sea, we take our axe, our sword, in hand. We call it many things. But it is just the one thing, it is. It is so that \"they\" see us. They see what bravery we do in their name so that they know, when the world ends, that we are good enough to stand beside them. We do this for the Stone Court.": "我们追求的荣耀，难道不是这样吗？我们突击队员，我们出海，我们拿着我们的斧头，我们的剑，在手。我们称它为许多东西。但它只是一件事，它是。这是为了让 \"他们 \"看到我们。他们看到我们以他们的名义所做的勇敢行为，以便他们知道，当世界结束时，我们足以站在他们身边。我们这样做是为了石法院。",
	"During character creation, players may select one of the epic backgrounds for this campaign, instead of the standard backgrounds in the player's guide. These enhanced backgrounds connect to the main storyline and provide additional subplots for the heroes to explore. It is recommended that they are used instead of the standard backgrounds. Each player should choose one of the backgrounds described in this section. This influences the hero's mythic connection to Grimnir through the use of fate runes new runes (and powers) may be revealed at particular moments as the hero resolves the conflict underlying their background.": "在角色创建过程中，玩家可以选择本活动的史诗背景之一，而不是玩家指南中的标准背景。这些增强的背景与主要的故事情节相联系，并为英雄们提供了额外的次要情节来探索。建议使用这些背景，而不是标准背景。每个玩家都应该选择本节中描述的背景之一。这影响了英雄通过使用命运符文与格里姆尼尔的神话联系，当英雄解决其背景下的冲突时，新的符文（和力量）可能会在特定时刻显现。",
	"Each background has specific endeavors for the hero to complete. Heroic tasks will be completed by the end of the {@b Raiders of the Serpent Sea} campaign. Epic goals are longer term and may not be achieved within the campaign.": "每个背景都有特定的努力，供英雄完成。英雄的任务将在{@b Raiders of the Serpent Sea}活动结束时完成。史诗般的目标是更长期的，可能无法在运动中实现。",
	"Several races exist only in Grimnir. Regardless of how they came to be, each has a unique role in both the world, and the events to come.": "有几个种族只存在于Grimnir。无论他们是如何形成的，每个种族在这个世界和即将发生的事件中都有独特的作用。",
	"The wicker? If their sword swing is true and their shield never falters, then they are all right by me.": "筚路蓝缕？如果他们的剑挥舞得很真实，他们的盾牌也从不动摇，那么他们在我眼里都是正确的。",
	"I've stood against many raiders, I've even slain a jarl. But those giant kin of theirs, carry swords as big as trees. No servant of the kingdom can stand alone against such monsters as those.": "我对抗过许多突袭者，我甚至杀过一个爵士。但他们的那些巨人亲属，拿着像树一样大的剑。没有一个王国的仆人能独自对抗这样的怪物。",
	"Raiders of the Serpent Sea introduces several new class archetypes that suit the world of Grimnir. Some of the archetypes are associated with a specific raiding clan. Discuss with your GM if you would prefer to originate from a different clan in most cases this should be acceptable.": "蛇海突袭者》引入了几个适合格里姆尼尔世界的新等级原型。其中一些原型与特定的突袭部族有关。如果你喜欢来自不同的部族，请与你的GM讨论，在大多数情况下，这应该是可以接受的。",
	"Nothing is more inspiring than to stand upon a longship and hear our raider drums, our raider song-words raised to the skies. The music of battle powers the sword-arms and fighting hearts, of our raiders.": "没有什么比站在长船上听到我们的突击队鼓声，我们的突击队歌声响彻云霄更令人振奋。战斗的音乐为我们的突击队员的剑臂和战斗的心提供动力。",
	"Lived long, have I. Long enough to see many a clan rise... and fall. Yet this, a dead clan reborn? And astride creatures from the Lost Lands? This, I have not seen.": "我活了很久，足以看到许多家族的兴起... 和衰落。然而这，一个死去的部族重生了？还骑着来自失落之地的生物？这一点，我还没有见过。",
	"Those raiders be riding their feral beasts into battle, even on the vast icy plains. We've crossed sword and spear a few times, the past years... they grow ever bolder.": "那些突袭者骑着他们的野性野兽战斗，甚至在广阔的冰原上。在过去的几年里，我们已经用剑和矛交过几次手......他们变得越来越大胆。",
	"Wizards! Have we not learned from Mirgal's treachery? We, the völv, must continue our work, build upon the labors of those who precede us. No matter the power to be gained from a clan harnessing arcane magics, we must ensure that no jarl is ever seduced by a wizard's promises again. They are too dangerous. If only we could drown them all, our lands might yet be saved. This is no world for wizards.": "巫师们！难道我们没有从米尔加尔的背叛中吸取教训吗？我们，巫师，必须继续我们的工作，在我们之前的人的劳动基础上继续前进。无论从驾驭奥术魔法的部族中获得多少力量，我们都必须确保没有任何一个伯爵再被巫师的承诺所诱惑。他们太危险了。只要我们能把他们全部淹死，我们的土地就有可能被拯救。这不是一个适合巫师的世界。",
	"With the raiders spread across several small continents and numerous islands, the Serpent Sea is an essential lifeline: the waters provide food, trading opportunities, and the opportunity to capture enemy ships and treasure. The raiders take great pride in the longships they build to navigate those treacherous waters. Additionally and just as importantly longships can sail into the smaller rivers penetrating all the major land masses. This gives the raiders the ability to strike anywhere, even deep into enemy lands.": "由于突袭者分布在几个小大陆和众多岛屿上，蛇海是一条重要的生命线：这片水域提供食物、贸易机会，以及捕获敌方船只和财宝的机会。突击队员对他们建造的长船感到非常自豪，因为他们可以在这些险恶的水域中航行。此外，同样重要的是，长船可以驶入穿透所有主要陆地的小河。这使突击队员有能力在任何地方进行攻击，甚至深入到敌人的土地。",
	"Though the raiders are the most skilled sailors in this world, the Baendur also sail ships though usually no larger than explorer-class longships or bulky mercanskips. These are always at risk from the raiding clans.": "虽然袭击者是这个世界上最熟练的水手，但巴恩杜尔人也会开船，尽管通常不比探险家级别的长船或笨重的佣兵船大。这些船只总是面临着来自突击队的风险。",
	"There are a handful of standard ship designs, but each vessel is unique these are merely guidelines. A few coastal villages offer ship construction and customization services, and these will be found throughout the campaign and are indicated in the game master's rulebook.": "有一些标准的船只设计，但每艘船都是独一无二的，这些只是指南。一些沿海村庄提供船舶建造和定制服务，这些服务将在整个战役中被发现，并在游戏管理员的规则手册中注明。",
	"This is a four-oar rowing ship with a small sail. Though much smaller than a longship it can move a small party down most rivers and along the Serpent Sea itself, if they keep the coastline visible.": "这是一艘带小帆的四桨划船。虽然它比长船小得多，但如果他们能保持海岸线的可见度，它可以让一小队人马沿着大多数河流和蛇海本身前进。",
	"This is the smallest of the longships (usually no more than 60' long) and requires a crew of fourteen to row at full speed. Like all longships there is no lower deck or cabins so a crew must have the conviction (and patience) to sail long distances with one another on the open deck. It has oars for rowing as well as sails to increase speed when at sea. Given its lighter crew and faster speeds, it is often used as a scouting vessel.": "这是最小的长船（通常不超过60英尺长），需要14名船员来全速划船。像所有的长船一样，没有下层甲板或船舱，所以船员必须有信念（和耐心），在开放的甲板上互相航行很远的距离。它有用于划船的桨，也有用于提高海上速度的帆。鉴于其较轻的船员和较快的速度，它经常被用作侦察船。",
	"Chargers are larger than explorers, host a crew of around thirty, and boast additional cargo and passenger space. These are the standard longships used by established clans when raiding and they form the bulk of war fleets. Most young raiders grow up dreaming of owning such a vessel.": "充电船比探险船大，可容纳约30名船员，并拥有额外的货物和乘客空间。这些是成熟的部族在突袭时使用的标准长船，它们构成了战争舰队的主体。大多数年轻的突击队员在成长过程中都梦想着能拥有这样一艘船。",
	"This is the largest standard longship. Few carvers exist, given their expense to create and maintain, but those that do sail the Serpent Sea are fearsome, powerful vessels. Their length and width also accommodate the shipment of goods and the crew complement of sixty makes for a very well defended longship.": "这是最大的标准长船。鉴于其制作和维护的费用，很少有雕刻师存在，但那些在蛇海航行的船只是可怕的、强大的。它们的长度和宽度也能满足货物运输的需要，60名船员的编制使长船的防御能力非常强。",
	"Mercanskip is the raider name for the plump merchant vessels that the Baendur use to trade between their disparate kingdoms. Slow moving but heavily armored they are usually accompanied by numerous longships for protection. A few clans have kept mercanskips that they have plundered, making the ship an uncommon but not impossible sight amongst a raiding fleet as well. This is the only ship large enough to transport horses comfortably in lower holds.": "Mercanskip是Baendur人用来在他们不同的王国之间进行贸易的丰满商船的袭击者名称。它们移动缓慢，但装甲厚实，通常有许多长船相伴以提供保护。一些部族保留了他们所掠夺的商船，使得这种船在突击队中也是不常见的，但并非不可能。这是唯一一艘足够大的船，可以在下层舱中舒适地运输马匹。",
	"These large vessels are affectionately termed houseboats. Larger and spacious, they are also slow moving, and are never part of normal fleet operations. Most clans have one or two of these wooden vessels, usually docked at their primary village and set upon the Serpent Sea only to attend the Gathering at Drifthall every eight years.": "这些大型船只被亲切地称为房船。它们更大、更宽敞，但移动速度也很慢，而且从来不是正常舰队行动的一部分。大多数部族都有一到两艘这样的木船，通常停靠在他们的主要村庄，只在每八年一次的Drifthall聚会时才会出发到蛇海。",
	"In the complete player's book, additional sections will explain the basics of navigating the Serpent Sea, how to obtain and upgrade longships (and crew) as well as new naval rules and marine combat opportunities.": "在完整的玩家手册中，额外的部分将解释航行蛇海的基本知识，如何获得和升级长船（和船员），以及新的海军规则和海洋战斗机会。",
	"Grimnir is a primal world of islands spread across the winding Serpent Sea. The natives of Grimnir are the humans, elves, dwarves, and others that migrated here centuries again when their original world was destroyed by the {@i Yoten} a race of spell wielding giants. Over the years numerous creatures of other races have been brought to this world and many have joined clans and become Raiders of the Serpent Sea.": "Grimnir是一个原始的岛屿世界，分布在蜿蜒的蛇海中。格里姆尼尔的居民是人类、精灵、矮人和其他的人，当他们原来的世界被{@i Yoten}一个挥舞着法术的巨人的种族摧毁后，他们又迁移到这里几个世纪。多年来，无数其他种族的生物被带到了这个世界，许多人加入了氏族，成为蛇海的攻略者。",
	"{@b Ever Growing Mountain.} The inner peak, Turnjfall, still grows. It dominates the skyline from every corner of the world and from atop its peak the sky flashes with all the colors of the rainbow.": "{@b Ever Growing Mountain.}内峰特恩杰落仍在增长。它主宰着世界各个角落的天际线，从它的山顶上看，天空闪烁着彩虹的所有颜色。",
	"{@b A Primeval World.} The Serpent Sea is ringed by lava and volcanoes and earthquakes are commonplace. Islands rise and sink often. Such extreme landscapes bring with them massive creatures including great bears, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers. Even worse dwells in the forests of Turnjfall": "{@b A Primeval World.} 蛇海被熔岩环抱，火山和地震是常事。岛屿经常上升和下沉。这种极端的地貌带来了巨大的生物，包括大熊、猛犸象和剑齿虎。更可怕的是居住在Turnjfall的森林里。",
	"{@b The Long Winter.} Winter has not fully withdrawn its cold grip the past two years and all raiders are apprehensive as spring approaches. Will winter finally relent? If not, many are going to die of starvation or in battle over scarce resources.": "{@b The Long Winter.}在过去的两年里，冬天并没有完全收回它冰冷的手掌，随着春天的到来，所有的突击队员都很忐忑。冬天会不会最终缓和下来？如果没有，许多人将会死于饥饿或在争夺稀缺资源的战斗中。",
	"Heroes from the Lost Lands, known collectively as the Vanir, fought the Yoten but failed. They fled into Grimnir and eventually ruled all the lands settled by the raiders. But a Yoten, known as Boða, cursed them. The Vanir are now trapped as statues.": "来自失落之地的英雄们，被统称为瓦尼尔人，与约顿人作战，但失败了。他们逃到了格里姆尼尔，并最终统治了所有由突袭者定居的土地。但是，一个被称为Boða的Yoten诅咒了他们。瓦尼尔人现在被困于雕像之中。",
	"{@b Aldyhn.} Goddess of Wisdom; the Hallharn (leaders, clergy)": "{@b Aldyhn.} 智慧女神；Hallharn（领袖、神职人员）。",

	"The goddess of death, Hel, rules all those who die outside of battle. Her realm is said to be a dreary place of unrelenting torment though not all agree. Helmaws open on occasion around the world, allowing mortals to pass into her domain. A few do return.": "死亡女神赫尔统治着所有在战斗之外死亡的人。据说她的领域是一个沉闷的地方，充满了无情的折磨，但并非所有的人都同意。世界各地的地狱之门偶尔会打开，允许凡人进入她的领域。有几个人确实回来了。",
	"Most raiders believe in living every day to its fullest. They eat, they drink, and they fight. Celebration whether it is a victory, a birth, or an alliance—is vital.": "大多数突击队员相信每天都会过得很充实。他们吃，他们喝，他们战斗。庆祝活动，无论是胜利、出生还是结盟，都是至关重要的。",
	"But above all, joining their ancestors in the {@i Halls of the Slain} is most important. The {@i almost-god}, Thonir, son of Aldyhn and Slayer of the Last Yoten, is believed to rule these halls and is busy preparing the brave dead to do battle at the end of the world.": "但最重要的是，在{@i Halls of the Slain}中加入他们的祖先是最重要的。{@i almost-god}，索尼尔，阿尔代恩的儿子和最后一个约顿的杀手，被认为是这些大厅的统治者，正忙于准备勇敢的死者在世界末日的战斗。",
	"Several dozen kingdoms are scattered across the world, especially in the High North and along the western edge of the world. Few kingdoms make serious attempts to expand, especially not into raider territory, but they require trade with one another and do risk the seas, providing ripe targets for raiders to plunder. The most powerful Baendur is King Cenric Edgare.": "几十个王国散布在世界各地，特别是在高北地区和世界的西部边缘。很少有王国认真尝试扩张，尤其是不进入突袭者的领地，但他们需要彼此进行贸易，并确实冒着海洋的风险，为突袭者提供成熟的掠夺目标。最强大的巴恩杜尔是岑瑞克-埃德加雷国王。",
	"Raiders are pragmatic people that value strength and bravery. Though their martial traditions are important to them they also pride themselves on shipbuilding and their adherence to respecting their gods through divine traditions.": "袭击者是务实的人，重视力量和勇敢。虽然他们的武术传统对他们很重要，但他们也以造船和坚持通过神圣的传统尊重他们的神灵为荣。",
	"The raiders live in small and medium sized clans, primarily in wooden fortresses inhabiting the inner continents and surrounding islands. The clans are often in conflict, if not outright war with one another. Raiders relish gaining glory and spoils—their reward in the present life for their bravery in battle.": "突击队员生活在中小型部族中，主要居住在居住在内部大陆和周围岛屿的木制堡垒中。这些部族之间经常发生冲突，如果不是直接的战争的话。袭击者们津津乐道于获得荣耀和战利品--他们在现世对战斗中的勇敢的回报。",
	"{@b The Alljarl.} Each clan has their own jarl but once every eight years they meet at a gathering on the floating town of Drifthall to vote for an Alljarl who loosely leads the united clans in times of conflict. The current Alljarl is Mother Guhnbarg of the Hallharn.": "{@b The Alljarl.}每个部族都有自己的领主，但每八年一次，他们会在漂浮的Drifthall镇上举行集会，投票选出一个Alljarl，在冲突时松散地领导联合的部族。目前的全能者是霍尔哈恩的母亲古恩巴格。",
	"{@b The Völv.} Raider history is passed orally from generation to generation, which grants much respect to their elders who are stewards of knowledge. Most respected are the prophetic völv.": "{@b The Völv.} 突击者的历史是代代相传的，这使他们对作为知识管理者的长者非常尊重。最受尊重的是预言家沃尔夫。",
