	"Your DM may decide that only one single haggling check is necessary for all items a character is purchasing from a merchant, or may require a haggling check for each type of item a character buys. In this latter case, as an example, a character buying one candle and two sheets of paper would make two haggling checks (one for the candle and one for both sheets of paper) rather than three.": "你的管理员可以决定，一个角色从商人那里购买的所有物品都只需要一次讨价还价检查，也可以要求一个角色购买的每一种物品都要进行讨价还价检查。在后一种情况下，举例来说，一个角色买了一根蜡烛和两张纸，就需要进行两次讨价还价的检查（一次针对蜡烛，一次针对两张纸）而不是三次。",

	"Your DM might also decide that magic items are available for purchase, but are rare enough that they must be located from an interested seller first.

	"Your DM may allow you to sell magic items directly to merchants, using the listed prices on page 130 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. It should be noted that no merchant will ever have enough currency on-hand to buy a magic item above rare quality, though a savvy merchant may have reserves or be willing to barter in such a deal.": "你的管理员可以允许你直接向商人出售魔法物品，使用《地下城管理员指南》第130页上列出的价格。应该注意的是，没有哪个商人手上会有足够的货币来购买超过稀有品质的魔法物品，尽管精明的商人可能有储备，或者愿意在这样的交易中进行交换。",
	"Alternatively, your DM might rule that merchants cannot or will not buy magic items in this fashion. If this is the case, your DM may decide to use the rules for selling magic items present on pages 129-130 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, requiring a greater investment in time and money to find an interested buyer.": "另外，你的管理员可能会规定商人不能或不愿以这种方式购买魔法物品。如果是这种情况，你的管理员可能会决定使用《地下城管理员指南》第129-130页中关于出售魔法物品的规则，这需要投入更多的时间和金钱来寻找感兴趣的买家。",
	"Being able and willing to provide goods and services is what makes a merchant a merchant. The rules in this section help determine what a merchant has on-hand, and what they are willing to part with.": "能够并愿意提供货物和服务是商人成为商人的原因。本节中的规则有助于确定一个商人手上有什么，以及他们愿意放弃什么。",
	"Most merchants have incredibly robust lists of goods that may be available to them, but not every item on a merchant's list is in their inventory.": "大多数商人都有令人难以置信的强大的可能提供给他们的商品清单，但并非商人清单上的每件商品都在他们的库存中。",
	"To determine how many types of items a merchant has available in a given quality category, roll 1d8 + 4 one time for each quality category the merchant has access to. For example, a medium quality merchant would have access to items in the atrocious, poor, and good quality categories, and thus should roll {@dice 1d8 + 4} three separate times. If any of the merchant's quality categories have five or fewer items, do not roll for that category, and instead include all items that category has to offer (unless otherwise specified).": "要确定一个商人在某一质量类别中拥有多少种物品，请为该商人可以使用的每一质量类别掷出1d8+4一次。例如，一个中等质量的商人可以接触到糟糕的、差的和好的质量类别中的物品，因此应该分别掷出（%0%）三次。如果该商人的任何一个质量类别有五个或更少的物品，则不要对该类别进行滚动，而应包括该类别所能提供的所有物品（除非另有规定）。",
	"The result of these rolls determine how many types of item a merchant has in each quality category. The DM then selects which types of items the merchant has available, until the available types of items for each quality category equals the result of that category's roll, or there are no more items of the given quality to select.": "这些卷轴的结果决定了一个商人在每个质量类别中拥有多少种物品。然后，DM选择商人拥有的物品类型，直到每个质量类别的可用物品类型与该类别的卷轴结果相等，或者没有更多特定质量的物品可以选择。",
	"Usually, a merchant's stock changes after 30 days. When this happens, your DM should reroll for item availability, and select which type of items the merchant now has in stock.": "通常，一个商人的库存在30天后会发生变化。当这种情况发生时，你的DM应该重新计算物品的可用性，并选择该商人现在有哪种类型的物品库存。",
	"Each item in a merchant's inventory has a quantity associated with it. If an item is available, this is the quantity of that item the merchant has to sell. In most cases, these quantities are rerolled and replenished every 30 days, representing sales and changes in stock. If an item has a minus in its quantity (for example, {@dice 1d4-2}), there may be none of that item present, and the minimum quantity for such items is 0.": "商家库存中的每个物品都有一个与之相关的数量。如果一个物品是可用的，这就是商人要出售的该物品的数量。在大多数情况下，这些数量每30天会被重新计算和补充，代表销售和库存的变化。如果一个物品的数量中有一个减号（例如，{@dice 1d4-2}），则可能没有该物品，这种物品的最小数量为0。",
	"There are also special listings for quantity, as follows:": "还有一些特殊的数量列表，如下所示。",
	"Some items are not physically available in a merchant's shop at all, except perhaps as an example for demonstration purposes. An item listed as Made to Order is purchased before it is made, and once purchased takes a number of days to be completed equal to its gold cost divided by 10 (round up). Details specific to the item can be decided upon between the purchaser and merchant at the time of the item's sale.": "有些物品在商人的商店里根本就没有实物，也许只是作为一个例子用于演示。被列为 \"订制 \"的物品在制造之前就已经购买了，一旦购买，完成的天数等于其黄金成本除以10（四舍五入）。物品的具体细节可以在出售物品时由购买者和商人决定。",
	"Once completed, the purchaser usually must retrieve the item from the merchant. Larger items are usually assembled on-site and do not need to be retrieved, and most Good or Excellent merchants are willing to deliver smaller items directly to their clientele.": "一旦完成，购买者通常必须从商家那里取回物品。较大的物品通常在现场组装，不需要取回，大多数好的或优秀的商人愿意直接将较小的物品交付给他们的客户。",
	"Unlike other items on a merchant's table, items with this quantity do not restock after 30 days. Once an item listed as such is purchased (whether by a player character or an NPC), it is gone from the merchant's inventory permanently.": "与商人桌子上的其他物品不同，这种数量的物品在30天后不会再进货。一旦列出的物品被购买（无论是由玩家角色还是NPC），它就会从商人的库存中永久消失。",
	"Some merchants are able to cast spells for your benefit, in return for currency. Any specific merchant can only cast 3 spells per day, regardless of their spell level. A merchant is considered to have a spell attack modifier of +5, and a spell save DC of 13.": "一些商人能够为你施展法术，以换取货币。任何特定的商人每天只能施放3个法术，无论他们的法术等级如何。商人被认为有一个+5的法术攻击修改器，以及一个13的法术救赎DC。",
	"For the purposes of availability (and rolling to determine if types of items are available), spells are treated as if they were items. As such, certain merchants may not know some spells in their listed inventory, or simply may not have them prepared on a given day.": "就可用性而言（以及通过滚动来确定物品类型是否可用），法术被当作物品一样对待。因此，某些商人可能不知道他们列出的库存中的某些法术，或者在某一天根本没有准备这些法术。",
	"No two merchants are ever exactly alike, and variant merchants epitomize this. Certain merchant specialties include a sidebar with special rules for retrofitting them into a different type of merchant as a variant, which your DM may choose to do if that merchant is rolled.": "没有两个商人是完全相同的，而变体商人就是这一点的缩影。某些商人的特长包括一个侧边栏，其中有将其改造成不同类型的商人作为变体的特殊规则，如果该商人被轧制，你的管理员可以选择这么做。",
	"Often, variant merchants combine inventories between two different merchant specialties. If a variant merchant's rules instruct you to do so, combine these inventories before determining availability.": "通常情况下，变体商户会将两个不同商户的存货结合起来。如果一个变体商人的规则指示你这样做，那么在确定可用性之前，应将这些库存合并。",
	"Twists of fate and circumstance, as well as convenient trade routes, can bring certain specific merchants into repeated contact with a party of adventurers.": "命运和环境的转折，以及便利的贸易路线，可以使某些特定的商人与一队冒险家反复接触。",
	"Over time, reoccurring merchants might become more (or less) willing to haggle, as they become closer friends (or more contentious enemies) with the player characters. Consider how the party's relationship with a reoccurring merchant evolves, and what the merchant might ask of repeat customers and potential allies.": "随着时间的推移，重复出现的商人可能会变得更愿意（或更不愿意）讨价还价，因为他们与玩家角色成为更亲密的朋友（或更有争议的敌人）。考虑一下玩家与经常出现的商人的关系如何演变，以及商人可能对回头客和潜在盟友提出什么要求。",
	"Most items in merchant inventories have a listed source, denoting the book and page number in which they are found.
