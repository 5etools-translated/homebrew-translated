	"The Ancients built their civilizations, reaching heights we cannot even fully imagine now. They spoke to the stars, reshaped the creatures of the world, and mastered form and essence. They built cities and machines that have since crumbled to dust, leaving the barest remnants.": "古人建立了他们的文明，达到了我们现在都无法完全想象的高度。他们与星星对话，重塑世界上的生物，并掌握了形式和本质。他们建造了城市和机器，这些城市和机器后来都坍塌成了尘埃，只剩下最原始的遗迹。",
	"These remnants are usually called \"the numenera,\" a term that refers to anything that originates from a cache of Ancients' lore, such as bio-shaped creatures, beings partly replaced with machine-flesh, and creatures brought here from alien worlds and dimensions heretofore unknown. It also includes things that have been indirectly created by the incomprehensible lore of the Ancients—mutants and flesh-shaping accidents, the descendants of experiments, and so on.": "这些残余物通常被称为 \"numenera\"，这个术语指的是任何源自古人传说的缓存的东西，例如生物形状的生物、部分被机器肉体取代的生物，以及从以前未知的异世界和维度带到这里的生物。它还包括由古人的不可理解的传说间接创造的东西--突变体和肉体塑造的意外，实验的后代，等等。",
	"Although the comparison between \"magic\" and the numenera is worthwhile, taking it too far is likely a mistake. Yet it's still just as mysterious and strange, mostly because the numenera is varied and unpredictable to those who don't understand it, which is pretty much everyone.": "尽管将 \"魔法 \"和数字空间进行比较是值得的，但走得太远很可能是个错误。然而，它仍然是一样的神秘和奇怪，主要是因为对于那些不了解它的人，也就是几乎所有的人来说，Numenera是多样的，不可预测的。",
	"There are people, however, who {@i attempt} to understand it—at least to some degree. Not everyone lives in terror of it. Some recover numenera from Ancients' caches, study it, comprehend a bit of it, and then use it for their own purposes.": "然而，有些人（%0%）理解它--至少在某种程度上。不是每个人都生活在对它的恐惧中。有些人从古人的藏匿处找到钱币，研究它，理解它的一点，然后为自己的目的使用它。",
	"Player characters may be just such people. Though their hand may be forced by events surrounding the discovery of the Ancients, such as the activation of an Ancients device that could spell doom unless it is at least partially comprehended, then deactivated or channeled in some fashion.": "玩家角色可能就是这样的人。虽然他们的手可能会被围绕着发现古人的事件所逼迫，比如激活一个古人的装置，除非它至少被部分理解，然后被停用或以某种方式被引导，否则会带来厄运。",
	"Devices of the Ancients can be categorized as {@filter cyphers|items|source=AotA|type=cypher}, {@filter relics|items|source=AotA|type=relic}, and {@filter iron flesh|items|source=AotA|type=iron flesh}, as well as {@book oddities|AotA|0|Oddities}, {@book mutations|AotA|0|Mutations}, and {@book discoveries|AotA|0|Discoveries}. These categories show how the PCs interact with the numenera—how it is (or isn't) useful to them. When thinking about technology, the GM can also consider origin and appearance. This approach looks at devices not from a game-mechanic standpoint, but from the point of view of people living in the world.": "古人的设备可以分为（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%），以及（%3%）、（%4%）和（%5%）。这些类别显示了NPC如何与numenera互动--它对他们是（或不是）有用的。在考虑技术的时候，GM也可以考虑起源和外观。这种方法不是从游戏机械的角度看设备，而是从生活在这个世界上的人的角度看。",
	"Sometimes, numenera devices are complex metallic devices. However, their {@book shape and substance can vary wildly|AotA|1|Numenera Device Shapes and Materials}, so much that those unused to Ancients' craft may not even realize that they're interacting with a machine or device, at least not initially.": "有时，numenera设备是复杂的金属装置。然而，他们的（%0%），以至于那些不熟悉古人工艺的人甚至可能没有意识到他们正在与机器或设备互动，至少最初没有。",
	"The size of numenera devices is variable, even between instances of the same cypher, relic, or iron flesh. If a size isn't specified in the item description, if it becomes necessary to know, the GM should simply determine how large the sphere, cube, nodule, disc, and so on, as seems reasonable based on the overall description. A {@item astute weapon nodule|AotA|weapon nodule}, for instance, must be small enough to be applied to a weapon in a way that doesn't interfere with the weapon's use.": "数值装置的大小是可变的，甚至在同一赛尔号、遗迹或铁肉的实例之间也是如此。如果物品描述中没有指定尺寸，如果有必要知道，GM应该简单地确定球体、立方体、结点、圆盘等的尺寸，因为根据整体描述似乎是合理的。例如，一个（%0%），必须小到足以应用于武器，并且不影响武器的使用。",
	"Devices pulled from an ancient ruin might be complete devices found intact, but many are likely portions of another device that can be used for a function all their own. Examples of the former include a bracerlike device with a touch-sensitive activation surface that the wearer can manipulate to create a powerful energy field around them. The latter might be a glass pane taken from a vast machine that by itself allows the user to see through an inch of normal matter.": "从古代遗迹中发现的设备可能是完整的设备，但许多设备可能是另一个设备的一部分，可以用来实现自己的功能。前者的例子包括一个类似手镯的设备，它有一个触摸敏感的激活表面，佩戴者可以操纵它在他们周围创造一个强大的能量场。后者可能是一个从巨大的机器上取下的玻璃板，它本身可以让使用者看穿一英寸的正常物质。",
	"Cyphers, relics, iron flesh, oddities, and discoveries are often found in Ancients' caches or in the hoard of a conquered monster that previously visited an Ancient's cache.": "赛弗、遗物、铁肉、古怪的东西和发现常常在古人的藏匿处或在以前去过古人藏匿处的被征服的怪物的囤积物中被发现。",
	"Locations include those containing machines and machine scrap, functioning or dead installations, integrated machines, crashed or working vehicles, automatons (a kind of construct), or caches of alchemical substances or other materials.": "地点包括那些包含机器和机器废料、正在运行或已经死亡的装置、集成机器、坠毁或正在运行的车辆、自动装置（一种构造物）、或藏匿的炼金物质或其他材料。",
	"Monsters with such devices include those associated with a particular vault or cache, or creatures who have previously looted such a place or otherwise obtained arcana of the Ancients.": "拥有这种装置的怪物包括那些与特定的金库或藏匿处有关的怪物，或者那些曾经掠夺过这种地方或以其他方式获得古人奥义的生物。",
	"The salvaging process includes extracting a functioning device of the Ancients from some larger device, machine, or even a defunct construct or creature with devices integrated into its flesh. This process also often includes manipulating what is found to cobble together something that works (though identifying what it does before it's used is a separate Intelligence ({@variantrule Optional Rule: Intelligence (Ancients Arcana)|AotA|Arcana}) check). For example, the PCs' search might entail not just finding a device but also figuring out that if they hook it up to a nearby energy-producing object, open a small panel, and fiddle with the workings, they produce the device's effect (which might not be the device's original use at all).": "抢救的过程包括从一些更大的设备、机器、甚至是已经失效的构造物或生物的肉体中提取一个可以运作的古人装置。这个过程通常还包括操纵找到的东西来拼凑出可以使用的东西（尽管在使用之前确定它的作用是一个单独的智力（{@variantrule Optional Rule: Intelligence (Ancients Arcana)|AotA|Arcana}）检查）。例如，NPC的搜索可能不仅需要找到一个装置，还需要弄清楚如果他们把它连接到附近的一个产生能量的物体上，打开一个小面板，然后摆弄一下工作原理，他们就会产生装置的效果（这可能根本不是装置的原始用途）。",
	"When the PCs come upon an area where salvaging numenera might be possible, the GM may call for a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. It's ideal if characters can devote at least ten minutes to an hour to exploring and poring over a suitable source. Characters skilled in Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) can apply half their regular proficiency bonus.": "当NPC遇到一个有可能打捞Numenera的区域时，GM可以要求进行智慧（（%0%））检查或智力（（%1%））检查。最理想的情况是，角色们至少能花10分钟到1小时来探索和研究一个合适的来源。熟练掌握智力（（%2%））的角色可以应用他们常规熟练度奖励的一半。",
	"The GM sets the salvaging DC, usually 10.": "GM设定打捞的DC，通常是10。",
	"Numenera devices have rarities that correspond with magic items: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary. These rarities provide a rough gauge on each item's relative power. If the GM is in the habit of using treasure hoard tables, those rarities roughly correspond to magic item rarities in terms of relative power. However, they do not correspond to actual odds of being found as part of random treasures, because all Ancients items are extremely rare, usually only associated with Ancients' vaults and caches, or in the possession of NPCs or creatures that have looted such a cache.": "Numenera设备的稀有性与魔法物品相对应：常见、不常见、稀有、非常稀有或传奇。这些稀有度提供了一个关于每个物品的相对力量的粗略衡量。如果GM有使用宝藏囤积表的习惯，这些稀缺性在相对力量方面大致对应于魔法物品的稀缺性。然而，它们并不对应于作为随机宝藏的一部分被发现的实际几率，因为所有的古人物品都是极其罕见的，通常只与古人的金库和藏匿处有关，或者由掠夺过这种藏匿处的NPC或生物拥有。",
	"Once the PCs find or salvage a device of the Ancients, identifying what it might actually do ahead of time, before the item is first used, is an additional Intelligence (Arcana) check (halved proficiency, unless the Ancients Arcana optional rule is used).": "一旦NPC发现或抢救了一个古人的装置，在第一次使用该物品之前，提前确定它的实际作用，是一个额外的智力（阿卡纳）检查（熟练度减半，除非使用古人阿卡纳的可选规则）。",
	"The GM sets the check DC, usually 10 for cyphers and oddities, and 15 for relics and iron flesh. The process takes 1 to 10 minutes. If the attempt fails, PCs may retry, but all identification retry checks have disadvantage.": "GM设定检查DC，通常对 cyphers和古怪的东西是10，对遗物和铁肉是15。这个过程需要1到10分钟。如果尝试失败了，PC可以重试，但是所有的识别重试检查都是不利的。",
	"A character can attempt to use a device that is not identified; this is usually a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Failure might mean that the PC can't figure out how to use the device or that they use it incorrectly (GM's discretion). Of course, even if the PC uses the unidentified device correctly, they have no idea what its effect will be. Most of the time, using an identified Ancients device is one action, unless specified otherwise.": "一个角色可以尝试使用一个未被识别的装置；这通常是一个DC 15智力（阿卡纳）检查。失败可能意味着人物无法弄清如何使用这个装置，或者他们使用的方法不正确（GM的判断）。当然，即使PC正确地使用了不明装置，他们也不知道它的效果会是什么。大多数时候，使用一个已识别的古人装置是一个行动，除非另有规定。",
	"The rules for identifying the numenera assume that a character has previously had some experience finding and figuring out similar items of the Ancients. The GM may wish to put more of a spotlight on the PCs' {@i first} interaction with and attempts to identify a device's function. In this case, the character needs to make Intelligence checks before failing two to identify the object and determine what it does when triggered. Each failure might have some small side effect (such as a weird buzz, glow, a shock, or something related to the item's function). If the overall attempt is a failure, the GM may introduce a complication that results in the device being prematurely triggered, probably negatively affecting the PC.": "识别数字的规则假定角色以前有一些寻找和弄清古人类似物品的经验。GM可能希望把更多的注意力放在NPC与{@i first}设备的互动和试图识别设备的功能上。在这种情况下，角色需要在两次失败之前进行智力检查，以识别该物品并确定它被触发时的作用。每一次失败都可能有一些小的副作用（如奇怪的嗡嗡声、发光、震动或与该物品功能有关的东西）。如果整个尝试是失败的，GM可能会引入一个复杂的因素，导致该装置被提前触发，可能会对PC产生负面影响。",
	"After a PC has identified a device of the Ancients once or twice, use the regular rules for identifying the numenera.": "在个人电脑识别了一两次古人的装置后，使用常规的规则来识别数位。",
	"A cypher is a leftover device of vanished civilizations so advanced that even their cast-off technology provides amazing effects. The use a PC finds for the cypher is probably not the use originally intended. Cyphers are not magical, though their effects may seem so.": "赛尔号是已经消失的文明所遗留的设备，它是如此先进，甚至他们的废弃技术也能提供惊人的效果。一个人发现的赛尔号的用途很可能不是原来的用途。密语不是魔法，尽管它们的效果看起来如此。",
	"Cyphers are often found in groups of one to six (the GM can roll {@dice 1d6} to determine the number found). The GM can prepare a list ahead of time of what successful searchers find. Sometimes this list is random, and sometimes logic can dictate content. For example, the PCs might find four different pills in the same location, which once might have stored pharmaceuticals.": "搜索器通常以1到6个为一组被发现（GM可以通过掷骰子（%0%）来决定发现的数量）。GM可以提前准备一份清单，列出成功的搜索者找到的内容。有时这个清单是随机的，而有时逻辑可以决定内容。例如，NPC可能会在同一个地方找到四种不同的药丸，而这个地方曾经可能存放过药品。",
	"Cyphers are consumable items. Using a cypher usually requires an action, but could take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a cypher takes effect immediately, leaving behind a defunct device with no further obvious function. Cyphers that can be used to make attacks include a relevant save DC in their descriptions.": "密码器是可消耗的物品。使用一个加密器通常需要一个动作，但也可能需要更长的时间，如其描述中所规定的。一旦使用，密码器就会立即生效，留下一个不再有明显功能的失效装置。可以用来进行攻击的密语在其描述中包含了相关的救赎DC。",
	"If too many cyphers are carried by the same PC—usually more than 3—a strange and dangerous resonance builds between the devices and the PC's mind and body. Most don't wait to find out what happens if that resonance goes to completion, because it's usually bad. . . if not right away, then eventually. When things finally go bad, the cyphers that exceed this limit are destroyed. More serious consequences involve permanent reduction in the PC's physical stats when all their cyphers melt together into a burning slag heap, a horrendous war machine of the Ancients spontaneously arising at the location, or the character being sucked through a brief, tiny singularity and destroyed beyond recovery.": "如果同一台电脑携带了太多的赛尔号--通常超过3个--就会在设备和电脑的思想和身体之间产生奇怪而危险的共鸣。大多数人都不会等闲视之，因为如果这种共振完成后会发生什么，因为它通常很糟糕。......即使不是马上，也是最终。当事情最终变坏时，超过这个限度的赛博会被摧毁。更严重的后果是，当他们所有的赛博融化成一堆燃烧的渣滓时，个人的身体素质会永久下降，一个可怕的古人的战争机器会自发地出现在这个地方，或者角色会被吸进一个短暂的、微小的奇点，并被摧毁，无法恢复。",
	"Using the {@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA}, roll {@dice d100} and then add 10 to the result for each cypher over the character's maximum limit. For cyphers that don't seem like they should be particularly volatile, such as pills, elixirs, or other simple or mundane items, add nothing—or, if you prefer, subtract 10 from the result. If the result is nonsensical, move up one result. If it is still nonsensical, move down one result from the original. Continue until a logical result occurs. Roll on the table each day that the cyphers are gathered together.": "使用{@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA}，掷出{@dice d100}，然后为每一个超过角色最大限度的赛博添加10的结果。对于那些看起来不应该是特别不稳定的密码器，如药丸、灵药或其他简单或平凡的物品，不加任何东西，或者，如果你愿意，从结果中减去10。如果结果是无稽之谈，就往上移一个结果。如果还是不符合逻辑，就在原来的基础上减少一个结果。继续下去，直到出现一个符合逻辑的结果。每天在赛博会上滚动，把赛博放在一起。",
	"Additional GM guidance for {@book using cyphers|AotA|1|Using Cyphers in Your Game} is provided in {@book Chapter 5|AotA|1}.": "在{@book Chapter 5|AotA|1}中提供了关于{@book using cyphers|AotA|1|Using Cyphers in Your Game}的额外全球机制指导。",
	"Cyphers have different forms based on three parameters: internal, wearable, and usable. Internal cyphers are things you ingest or inject. Wearable cyphers are articles of clothing, jewelry, or other things you wear on your physical body. Usable cyphers are basically anything else.": "密码器根据三个参数有不同的形式：内部、可穿戴和可使用。内部赛博是你摄入或注射的东西。可穿戴赛博是你穿在身上的衣服、珠宝或其他东西。可使用的赛博基本上是其他任何东西。",
	"Individual cypher descriptions present the most common form they are found in. Most cyphers can exist in more than one form, but all forms work the same way. For example, an {@item antivenom pill|AotA|antivenom} can be found in the form of a pill, an ingestible liquid, or an injector. GMs can go with the indicated cypher form to speed play. However, nothing is impossible. If the GM wants a pill that allows anyone swallowing it to teleport, then it exists.": "各个赛尔号的描述呈现的是它们最常见的形式。大多数赛尔号可以以一种以上的形式存在，但所有形式的工作方式都是一样的。例如，一个{@item antivenom pill|AotA|antivenom}可以以药片、可摄入的液体或注射器的形式出现。GM可以采用指定的赛博形式来加速游戏。然而，没有什么是不可能的。如果GM想要一种药丸，让吞下它的人可以传送，那么它就存在。",
	"Relics are the devices left over from the civilizations of the past. These are devices of a more permanent nature than cyphers (unless they run out of power) with more straightforward applications—weapons, armor, utility items, and so on. Still, they are rarely straightforward in actual use. Rather than find a device that was meant to be used as a weapon, the PCs are far more likely to find an item that was originally intended for another purpose but that has been modified (as best as contemporary understanding can manage) and now can be used as a ranged weapon.": "遗物是过去文明留下的设备。这些设备的性质比赛博更持久（除非它们耗尽了能量），有更直接的应用--武器、盔甲、实用物品，等等。尽管如此，它们在实际使用中很少是直接的。与其说NPC找到了一个本应作为武器使用的装置，不如说他们更有可能找到一个原本有其他用途的物品，但经过修改（以当代人的理解能力为限），现在可以作为远程武器使用了。",
	"Remember that relics are incomprehensible devices, likely powered by transdimensional siphons using nanotechnology to rewrite reality on an atomic or subatomic level. Even to someone who understands a great deal about Ancients arcana, most relics {@i appear} to be more magic than machine. Of course, they are not actually magical.": "请记住，遗迹是难以理解的设备，可能是由跨维度的虹吸管提供动力，使用纳米技术在原子或亚原子层面上改写现实。即使对一个对古人的奥秘了解甚多的人来说，大多数遗物（0%）都是魔法多于机器。当然，它们实际上并不具有魔力。",
	"Still, some relics require attunement to use. You can be attuned to no more than three attunable relics at a time. If you bear more than three attunable items (including attunable magic items and iron flesh), only a subset of them will provide their functions and/or magic abilities, depending on which you've selected.": "不过，有些遗物需要调谐才能使用。你在同一时间可以与不超过三个可调整的遗物相适应。如果你携带超过三个可调整的物品（包括可调整的魔法物品和铁肉），只有其中的一个子集会提供其功能和/或魔法能力，这取决于你所选择的。",
	"Many relics have a chance of power depletion per use, rather than having a set number of charges per day like some magic items and iron flesh. If a relic with a depletion is used or activated, the player rolls the designated die (1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d100). If the die shows the depletion number(s), the item works, but that is its last use. Some devices never deplete, some require attunement, and those with an entry of \"automatic\" can be used only once.": "许多遗物在每次使用时都有能量耗尽的机会，而不是像一些魔法物品和铁肉那样每天有固定的充电次数。如果一个有耗损的遗物被使用或激活，玩家会掷出指定的骰子（1d6, 1d10, 1d20, 或1d100）。如果骰子显示耗尽的数字，那么这个物品就可以使用，但这是它最后一次使用。有些装置永远不会耗尽，有些需要调整，而那些有 \"自动 \"条目的装置只能使用一次。",
	"For instance, a {@item mephitic staff|AotA} has a depletion of 1 in 1d20. When a player rolls a d20 to check the depletion and gets a 1, the relic depletes, and that usage is the last time the relic works.": "例如，一个{@item mephitic staff|AotA}在1d20中的消耗量为1。当玩家掷出d20检查损耗并得到1时，遗物就会损耗，而那次使用是遗物最后一次工作。",
	"If a relic with a depletion could be used in a way that doesn't require a depletion roll, the circumstances under which the depletion must be checked are specified.": "如果一个有耗损的遗物可以用一种不需要耗损卷的方式来使用，那么就规定在什么情况下必须检查耗损。",
	"Relics often aren't entirely what they seem. An item that functions like a weapon in the PC's hands once might have been a part of a very different device with a very different purpose. Another relic might be a cobbled-together mess of various parts, created by someone who didn't really understand what they were doing. Thus, sometimes relics don't do what is expected, or they do something in addition to their desired function. These are {@table List of Relic Quirks|AotA|relic quirks}.": "遗物往往不完全是它们看起来的样子。一个在PC手中像武器一样运作的物品可能是一个非常不同的装置的一部分，有着非常不同的目的。另一个遗物可能是由各种部件拼凑而成的，是由一个并不真正了解他们在做什么的人创造的。因此，有时遗物并没有起到预期的作用，或者它们在预期功能之外还做了一些事情。这些是（%0%）。",
	"Quirks might be a requirement for activation. They could be side effects that happen all the time with the relic, either continuously or each time it is activated. They might also be something that happens occasionally—for example, quirks could be a good time for the GM to throw a complication at a PC.": "怪癖可能是激活的一个要求。它们可能是遗迹一直发生的副作用，要么是持续发生，要么是每次激活。它们也可能是偶尔发生的--例如，怪癖可能是GM向PC抛出一个复杂问题的好时机。",
	"Some machines discovered in the crypts of the Ancients latch onto explorers, implanting their flesh with a sparking iron device. The intruding object could slowly render the explorer to a fine powder, insinuate their mind with horrific images, or enact some other unwanted change. However, the implant could instead grant an all-new beneficial capability.": "在古人的墓穴中发现的一些机器会吸附在探险者身上，在他们的肉体上植入一个带火花的铁器。侵入的物体可能会慢慢地把探险者变成细小的粉末，用可怕的图像侵入他们的头脑，或者进行一些其他不需要的改变。然而，这种植入物反而可以赋予一种全新的有益能力。",
	"Such beneficial implants are known as {@table Random Iron Flesh Table|AotA|iron flesh}.": "这种有益的植入物被称为（%0%）。",
	"Though the abilities conferred by an iron flesh implant may seem supernatural, iron flesh is not magical.": "虽然铁肉植入物所赋予的能力似乎是超自然的，但铁肉并不具有魔法。",

	"Once attuned with your iron flesh, you gain an intuitive understanding of how to use it. Using iron flesh usually requires an action, but could take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a capability granted by your iron flesh takes effect immediately.": "一旦与你的铁肉相适应，你就会对如何使用它获得一种直观的理解。使用铁肉通常需要一个动作，但也可能需要更长的时间，这在其描述中有所说明。一旦使用，你的铁肉所赋予的能力会立即生效。",
	"Iron flesh implants use charges of internal energy that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an implant has is revealed when the iron flesh is identified. A user attuned to iron flesh also always knows how many charges are available. If the last charge is used on a given day, nothing untoward happens other than the object becoming inert until the following day when some of its charges renew.": "铁肉植入物使用内部能量的电荷，必须消耗这些能量来激活它们的特性。当铁肉被识别时，植入物所拥有的电荷数会被显示出来。适应铁肉的使用者也总是知道有多少电荷可用。如果在某一天用完了最后的电荷，除了物体会变成惰性，直到第二天它的一些电荷恢复，不会发生任何不测。",

	"You can have multiple instances of iron flesh, except in cases in which common sense would argue otherwise. For instance, you could have up to two iron flesh eye implants (one for each eye), two iron flesh gauntlets (one for each hand), but only one helm, spine, or heart. If you have an iron flesh that comes in the form of a spine implant, you could later replace it with a different spine, but lose the first.": "你可以拥有多个铁肉的实例，除非是在常识上有异议的情况。例如，你最多可以有两个铁肉眼睛的植入物（每只眼睛一个），两个铁肉护手（每只手一个），但只有一个头盔、脊柱或心脏。如果你有一个以脊柱植入形式出现的铁肉，你以后可以用不同的脊柱替换它，但会失去第一个。",
	"Normal rules for attunement also continue to apply.": "正常的调和规则也继续适用。",
	"Using iron flesh requires more of a commitment than other items, given that iron flesh essentially becomes part of the creature using it. Sometimes someone with iron flesh wants to remove it because it has stopped working, because a PC wants to put a different implant in its place, or because it is doing something unexpected. The procedure for removing iron flesh is akin to pulling out a minor organ. Unless a machine of the Ancients is found that can accomplish the procedure somewhat safely, removing a piece of iron flesh drops a character to 0 hit points, at which point they must begin making death saving throws each round until they stabilize (three DC 10 successes) or die. Of course, allies with healing abilities could step in with immediate assistance so the character never has to face death saving throws.": "使用铁肉需要比其他物品更多的承诺，因为铁肉本质上成为使用它的生物的一部分。有时，拥有铁肉的人想要移除它，因为它已经停止工作，因为一个人想要在它的位置上放置一个不同的植入物，或者因为它正在做一些意外的事情。移除铁肉的程序类似于拔出一个小器官。除非找到一台古人的机器，可以在一定程度上安全地完成这个过程，否则移除一块铁肉会使一个角色的命中率下降到0，在这一点上，他们必须每回合开始进行死亡拯救，直到他们稳定下来（三次DC10成功）或死亡。当然，具有治疗能力的盟友可以立即介入协助，这样这个角色就不必面对死亡拯救的考验了。",
	"At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. This optional rule operates like the feats optional rule; you can forgo taking the Ability Score Improvement feature to implant iron flesh instead.

	"Unlike magic items sometimes found in treasure hoards, the chance of discovering a device of the numenera is more inscrutable, and doesn't follow expected rhyme or reason. For instance, a particular Ancients' cache may contain a handful of cyphers. One cypher might make the air smell sweeter for an hour, while the one found right next to it could have the power to blast a hole in the fabric of space for a few seconds, destroying all creatures within 60 feet. This means that finding a device that confers a fantastic ability might be somewhat more likely when exploring a cache. However, Ancients' caches are equally likely to contain inscrutable threats that are difficult to discern or avoid, even when the devices looted from it do not seem especially powerful.": "与有时在宝藏中发现的魔法物品不同，发现一个数字装置的机会更加难以捉摸，而且不遵循预期的韵律或理由。例如，一个特定的古人藏匿处可能包含少量的密码。一个赛尔号可能会让空气闻起来更甜，持续一个小时，而紧挨着它的赛尔号可能有能力在空间结构上炸出一个洞，持续几秒钟，摧毁60英尺内的所有生物。这意味着，在探索藏匿处时，找到一个赋予奇妙能力的装置可能更有可能。然而，古人的藏匿处同样有可能包含难以辨别或避免的威胁，即使从那里掠夺的设备看起来并不特别强大。",

These devices are called {@table A Selection of Ancients Oddities|AotA|oddities}, and they serve a number of purposes.": "有时PC发现的东西很有趣，但没有真正的游戏价值。它们在战斗中没有帮助。它们并不授予惊人的力量。它们不能保护使用者。并非所有古人创造的东西都是战斗装置，或者现在可以作为战斗装置使用。这些设备被称为{@table A Selection of Ancients Oddities|AotA|oddities}，它们有许多用途。",
	"First, they provide verisimilitude—not everything is suited for an explorer. Second, they're interesting—weird little things that can be sold or used for barter or gifts. Third, and perhaps most important, they add more mystery and feelings of the unknown to the game because oddities are really, well, odd. Why did their creators make them? Were they once a part of a larger device with a more understandable function? No one knows, and it's likely that no one ever will.": "首先，它们提供了真实性--并非所有东西都适合探险家。第二，它们很有趣--古怪的小东西可以出售或用于交换或礼物。第三，也许是最重要的，它们为游戏增加了更多的神秘感和未知感，因为古怪的东西真的是，嗯，古怪。它们的创造者为什么要制造它们？它们是否曾经是一个更大的装置的一部分，具有更易理解的功能？没有人知道，而且很可能永远也不会有人知道。",
	"Oddities can be traded, sold, used, or given as interesting gifts. Usually, their value is around 10 gp, but some oddities might fetch as much as 50 gp depending on their potential utility.": "奇物可以被交易、出售、使用，或作为有趣的礼物赠送。通常情况下，它们的价值在10金币左右，但根据其潜在的效用，有些奇物的价格可能高达50金币。",

	"GMs are encouraged to ensure that oddities always seem odd. One day, have a PC's oddity work differently. For example, the cup that boils liquid now freezes it instead. The rod with blinking lights goes wild with lights and starts beeping as well. The small mirrored cube starts spinning on its own. No explanation is needed because the owner didn't really understand the oddity in the first place.": "我们鼓励GM确保奇特的东西总是显得很奇特。有一天，让一个人的怪癖以不同的方式工作。例如，可以煮沸液体的杯子现在可以将其冻结。闪烁着灯光的棒子也开始疯狂发光，并开始发出哔哔声。小镜子的立方体开始自己旋转。不需要解释，因为主人一开始就没有真正理解这个怪异的东西。",

	"A mutation is a change in a creature's genes that makes it different than the genes from its parents. Some mutations are minor and inconsequential, like having blue eyes instead of brown eyes; some are significant, like being able to create a slippery slime with your skin; and some are detrimental, like a hand missing fingers or an eye that can't see color. A creature might be a mutant from birth, or become a mutant later in life. A mutant's abilities might manifest early on, or lay dormant until triggered by a stressful event. It is possible for any sort of living creature—including a PC—to be born as or become a mutant. Having a mutation doesn't change a creature's species. A mutant high elf is still a high elf, a mutant bugbear is still a bugbear, and a mutant red dragon is still a red dragon.": "突变是一种生物基因的变化，使其与父母的基因不同。有些突变是次要的和不重要的，比如拥有蓝眼睛而不是棕色眼睛；有些是重要的，比如能够用皮肤制造滑溜溜的粘液；有些是有害的，比如一只手缺少手指或一只眼睛看不到颜色。一个生物可能一出生就是变种人，也可能在生命后期成为变种人。变种人的能力可能在早期就表现出来，也可能处于休眠状态，直到被压力事件触发。任何一种生物--包括个人，都有可能生来就是变种人或成为变种人。变异并不改变一个生物的种类。一个变异的高精灵仍然是高精灵，一个变异的虫人仍然是虫人，一个变异的红龙仍然是红龙。",
	"A mutation might be accidental or deliberate. Exposure to powerful energy sources such as radiation and extradimensional energy can cause tiny changes in a creature's genes that manifest as a mutation. Exotic chemicals and certain poisonous substances (including wastelands) are known to cause mutations in creatures who survive exposure to them. The Ancients dabbled in creating and altering life, and some of their experiments used strange processes and devices that created specific mutations in their subjects.": "突变可能是意外的或故意的。暴露在强大的能量源中，如辐射和超维能量，可以导致生物的基因发生微小变化，表现为突变。众所周知，外来化学品和某些有毒物质（包括荒地）会在接触它们后幸存的生物中引起突变。古人涉足于创造和改变生命，他们的一些实验使用了奇怪的过程和设备，在他们的实验对象中产生了特定的突变。",
	"Mutants with similar traits sometimes band together. Those with hideous deformities face discrimination and derision. Some are outcasts, and others are revered, flaunting their mutations as a sign of superiority, power, and influence. Their mutations are seen as a blessing, not a curse. Some people believe them to be divine.": "具有类似特征的变种人有时会联合起来。那些有可怕畸形的人面临歧视和嘲笑。有些人被遗弃，有些人则受到尊敬，炫耀他们的变异，作为优越性、权力和影响力的标志。他们的变异被视为一种祝福，而不是一种诅咒。有些人认为他们是神圣的。",
	"Mutations are often hereditary, passed down from parent to child like any other trait, such as a hawkish nose or red hair. Over many generations, a mutation may spread throughout a community, and multiple mutations might change a group of creatures enough that they truly become a new species—{@creature chirog|AotA|chirogs}, {@creature killist|AotA|killisti}, and {@creature margr|AotA} may once have been creatures like humans, goblins, and orcs, changed over time by mutation and inbreeding until they stabilized in their current forms.": "突变通常是遗传的，像其他特征一样从父母传给孩子，比如鹰钩鼻或红头发。经过许多代人的努力，一个突变可能会传播到整个社区，多个突变可能会改变一群生物，使它们真正成为一个新的物种--（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）可能曾经是人类、地精和兽人这样的生物，随着时间的推移，突变和近亲繁殖改变了它们，直到它们稳定在目前的形式。",
	"Five categories of mutation exist. {@table Beneficial mutations|AotA} bring about changes that are neither physically obvious nor extraordinary. {@table Powerful mutations|AotA} are like beneficial ones, but more potent. {@table Harmful mutations|AotA} are physical changes that are usually grotesque and somewhat debilitating. The fourth category, {@table distinctive mutations|AotA}, also provides significant abilities, but they mark the character as an obvious mutant. Last, {@table cosmetic mutations|AotA} bring no special capabilities at all and are merely cosmetic (although sometimes dramatically so).": "存在五类变异。{@table Beneficial mutations|AotA}带来的变化既不是物理上明显的，也不是非凡的。{@table Powerful mutations|AotA}与有益的一样，但更有效力。{@table Harmful mutations|AotA}是身体上的变化，通常是怪诞的，有些衰弱。第四类，{@table distinctive mutations|AotA}，也提供重要的能力，但它们标志着角色是一个明显的变种人。最后，{@table cosmetic mutations|AotA}根本没有带来任何特殊的能力，仅仅是外观上的变化（虽然有时很夸张）。",
	"In theory, there is a sixth category that might be called crippling mutations, but player characters never have this kind of mutation.

Such mutations prevent a character from being viable.": "理论上说，还有第六类可能被称为残废突变，但玩家角色从未有这种突变。残废突变的人可能生来就没有四肢，肺部几乎没有功能，没有大部分的大脑，等等。这种变异使角色无法生存。",
	"Though the abilities conferred by mutations may seem supernatural, they are not magical. Mutations are always rolled randomly (no matter what type of mutation they are).": "尽管突变所赋予的能力似乎是超自然的，但它们并不具有魔力。突变总是随机掷出的（不管是什么类型的突变）。",
	"With the GM's permission, you can play a character who was born a mutant or became a mutant before 1st level. These mutants have special abilities unavailable to other starting characters, but they come at a cost. You choose to play a mutant version of a human, elf, dwarf, or any other species the GM allows as PCs, and your mutant character has all of the normal traits for that choice except for ability score increases. Instead of those ability score increases, your mutant character gains one of the following sets of abilities:": "在总经理的允许下，你可以扮演一个生来就是变种人或在1级之前就成为变种人的角色。这些变种人拥有其他起始角色所不具备的特殊能力，但它们是有代价的。你可以选择扮演人类、精灵、矮人或GM允许的任何其他物种的变种人，而你的变种人角色除了能力分值增加外，拥有该选择的所有正常特质。你的突变体角色获得了以下几组能力之一，而不是那些能力得分的增加。",

She decides to take a risk and chooses to have three beneficial mutations and one harmful mutation. For her beneficial mutations she rolls 54 (poison resistance), 90 (slashing resistance), and 92 (bludgeoning resistance). For her harmful mutation, she rolls 48 (slow and lumbering). For distinctive mutations, she rolls 89 (eyes on stalks) and decides to stop before the character gets any weirder, and doesn't roll for any cosmetic mutations. Darcy then finishes her character (class, background, and so on) in the normal way.": "例如，达西想扮演一个变异的高精灵。她的角色得到了所有精灵和高精灵的特征，除了他们的能力得分奖励（精灵+2的灵巧奖励和高精灵+1的智力奖励）。她决定铤而走险，选择了三个有益的变异和一个有害的变异。对于她的有益变异，她掷出54分（抗毒）、90分（抗砍）和92分（抗重击）。对于她的有害变异，她的分数是48（缓慢和笨重）。对于独特的变异，她得到89分（眼睛长在树枝上），并决定在角色变得更奇怪之前停止，并且不对任何外观变异进行评分。然后，达西以正常方式完成了她的角色（等级、背景等等）。",

	"Discoveries are the most open-ended of all types of numenera. Discoveries are the things that are too big to be gear, but might still do something cool—a portal to another planet, a machine that performs cybernetic implantation surgeries, or a force cube storage facility that can store anything, indefinitely. Each of these has great potential use to the PCs, but it's likely a onetime thing and they can't take it with them to use later. Discoveries are best thought of as part of an adventure as opposed to part of a PC's equipment. In this way, as with cyphers, you don't have to hold back when creating discoveries. The one rule of thumb should be that the cooler they are, the more challenging they are to reach. In some ways, these are proverbial treasure hoards.": "发现物是所有类型的numenera中最开放的。发现物是那些大得不能再大的东西，但仍然可以做一些很酷的事情--通往另一个星球的传送门，一台可以进行控制论植入手术的机器，或者一个可以无限期储存任何东西的力立方体储存设施。这些东西对NPC来说都有很大的潜在用途，但这很可能是一次性的，他们不能带着它以后使用。发现最好被认为是冒险的一部分，而不是PC装备的一部分。这样一来，就像赛弗一样，你在创造发现时不必有所保留。一个经验法则是，它们越酷，就越有挑战性。在某些方面，这些是传说中的宝藏。",
	"But not every discovery has to be of use to the PCs. Sometimes they are interesting for their own sake—and thus still worth finding and interacting with.": "但并不是每一个发现都必须对NPC有用处。有时它们本身就很有趣--因此仍然值得发现并与之互动。",

	"\"The numenera\" is a term that refers to anything that seems supernatural and that comes from the prior ages that predated even the Elder Elves. From a 21st-century point of view, this means devices, machines, vehicles, robots, computers, weapons, satellites, drugs, and so on. But it also means bioengineered creatures, cybernetic beings, and creatures brought here from alien worlds in other solar systems, or dimensions beyond those typically understood to be part of cosmology. In other words, it's not just high tech, but also devices that surpass even our 21st-century understanding—things that manipulate time, space, gravity, and more.": "\"numenera \"是一个术语，指的是任何看起来超自然的东西，这些东西来自甚至早于长老精灵的先前时代。从21世纪的角度来看，这意味着设备、机器、车辆、机器人、计算机、武器、卫星、药物等等。但它也意味着生物工程生物、控制论生物，以及从其他太阳系的外星世界带到这里的生物，或超越那些通常被理解为宇宙学一部分的维度。换句话说，它不仅是高科技，而且是超越我们21世纪的理解的设备--操纵时间、空间、重力等等的东西。",
	"However, it's important to remember that the player characters don't look at the numenera the way that 21st-century people look at technology. In a fantasy world, a force field projector and a two-way radio would seem not only like magic, but magic of the same level of power. In fact, the radio might seem more potent because its use is broader, and its effects are \"invisible.\" Characters with a medieval sensibility have no perspective on what sorts of technology are more advanced than others, and they take none of it for granted.": "然而，重要的是要记住，玩家角色并不像21世纪的人那样看待Numenera的技术。在一个幻想的世界里，一个力场投射器和一个双向无线电不仅看起来像魔法，而且是具有相同力量的魔法。事实上，无线电可能看起来更有力，因为它的用途更广泛，而且它的效果是 \"看不见的\"。具有中世纪感性的人物对什么样的技术比其他技术更先进没有任何看法，他们也不认为这是理所当然的。",
	"The same is likely true of many of the creatures presented in {@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA}. Commoners will likely think that most of them are simply \"demons.\" PC adventurers will likely learn differently, but the average villager, townsperson, trader, or guard in a fantasy setting doesn't have the knowledge or perspective to imagine that a thing nearly 20 feet tall that hungers for flesh is anything other than a supernatural beast of pure evil. But in truth, this thing—in this case a {@creature jiraskar|AotA}—is not a demon in the planar sense, but actually an apex predator, one of many somehow transported from the Ancients' time. Despite their size, they are animals. But the dangers that these creatures pose make a commoner's perceptions understandable. The concept of a demon—a spiritually evil entity—is a label for threats that can't be understood. To lump all creatures that hunger for flesh and hunt humans together as demons is clearly simplistic. Worse, doing so probably robs locals of potential strategies for dealing with such a creature. An animal can be dealt with. But a demon?": "{@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA}中提出的许多生物也可能是如此。普通人可能会认为他们中的大多数只是 \"恶魔\"。PC冒险者可能会了解到不同的情况，但一般的村民、镇民、商人或幻想环境中的卫兵并没有足够的知识或观点来想象一个近20英尺高、渴望吃肉的东西除了是纯粹的邪恶的超自然野兽之外还有什么。但事实上，这个东西--在这种情况下是{@creature jiraskar|AotA}--并不是平面意义上的恶魔，而实际上是一种顶级掠食者，是许多不知从古人的时代传送过来的东西之一。尽管它们体型庞大，但它们是动物。但这些生物所带来的危险使普通人的看法可以理解。恶魔的概念是一种精神上的邪恶实体，是对无法理解的威胁的一种标签。把所有渴望吃肉和猎杀人类的生物都归为恶魔，显然是简单化了。更糟糕的是，这样做可能使当地人失去了对付这种生物的潜在策略。一个动物可以被处理。但一个恶魔？",
	"Luckily, your PCs are likely to learn to discern the difference in time.": "幸运的是，你的电脑很可能会及时学会辨别差异。",
	"The adventure in Chapter 2—The Hills of Crooked Sleep—is designed to be the event that brings the numenera into your 5E game. During the course of the adventure, an incredible Ancients' cache is found and triggered. This has wide-ranging consequences.

	"However, the speed at which you want to introduce new material to your game is obviously completely up to you. If you'd rather keep each introduction of the numenera under strict control, in your game maybe a new cache must be searched out and opened by PCs each time something from this book is presented.": "然而，你想在你的游戏中引入新材料的速度显然完全取决于你。如果你想把每一个关于Numenera的介绍都放在严格的控制之下，在你的游戏中，也许每次介绍这本书中的东西时，都必须由NPC寻找并打开一个新的储藏室。",
	"You might prefer a more mixed approach. If PCs are opening caches, it's likely that NPCs are too. Not to mention powerful monsters like dragons, liches, demons, and of course, wizards eager to find new lore, danger be damned. Repercussions from such activities likely begin as a slow trickle, but could grow in magnitude over time, especially as entities locked away for time out of mind begin to find their way in the campaign world.": "你可能更喜欢一种更混合的方法。如果NPC正在打开贮藏室，很可能NPC也在打开。更不用说像龙、地衣、恶魔这样强大的怪物了，当然，还有急于寻找新传说的巫师，危险是不可能的。这类活动的反响很可能从缓慢的涓涓细流开始，但随着时间的推移，其规模可能会越来越大，特别是当被关在外面的实体开始在活动世界中找到他们的方式。",
	"Or not. It's entirely up to you. In your game, vaults containing the numenera might be so rare and hard to find that only PCs have means to find them, and then not easily.

You can always decide that new caches become available or open on their own later on, especially if a good story reason to do so occurs to you.": "或者没有。这完全取决于你。在你的游戏中，包含钱币的金库可能是如此稀少和难以找到，以至于只有个人有办法找到它们，而且还不容易。如果你对用奇怪的机器和设备充斥你的世界的前景有任何疑虑，那就慢慢开始。你总是可以决定新的储藏室以后可以使用或自行开放，特别是如果你想到了一个好的故事理由。",
	"It's very likely that as numenera gets out into the world, it falls into the hands of NPCs. And perhaps some of it has been around all along. Perhaps, for example, the floating castle that everyone assumed was magical is actually sustained by a machine from ancient times.": "很有可能，随着Numenera进入世界，它就会落入NPC的手中。也许有些东西一直都在附近。例如，也许大家都认为是魔法的浮动城堡实际上是由古代的机器维持的。",

	"Devices like cyphers, relics, and iron flesh do not individually call out their effects as being treated as if magic; however, they should be treated as producing magical effects if there is some question whether a triggered ability could affect a monster with magic resistance. For example, if a PC uses their {@item winter torque|AotA} iron flesh to create a cold burst that might affect a devil that has magic resistance, the devil's magic resistance applies.": "像赛弗、遗迹和铁肉这样的设备并没有单独地把它们的效果叫作如果是魔法的处理；但是，如果对触发的能力是否会影响到具有魔法抗性的怪物有一些疑问，它们应该被视为产生魔法效果。例如，如果一个PC使用他们的（%0%）铁肉创造了一个可能影响到具有魔法抗性的恶魔的寒冷爆裂，那么这个恶魔的魔法抗性就适用。",
	"There are a couple reasons for this default position, which go hand in hand.": "这种默认立场有几个原因，它们是相辅相成的。",
	"Story-wise, the fundamental extradimensional or cosmic energy that Ancients' technology uses might well be the same supernatural field that wizards and gods draw upon. Though the techniques used to produce the effects are different, they both stem from the same original font of chaos and change that underlies reality.": "从故事上看，古人的技术所使用的基本超维或宇宙能量很可能就是巫师和神灵所利用的超自然领域。虽然用于产生效果的技术不同，但它们都来自于支撑现实的混乱和变化的同一原始字体。",
	"Balance-wise, this allows the machines, devices, and creatures presented in this book to fit into the already-balanced ecosystem of the 5E ruleset, a ruleset that has given much thought to how magical effects play out among powerful entities.": "从平衡角度来说，这使得本书中介绍的机器、设备和生物能够融入5E规则集已经平衡的生态系统中，这个规则集对强大的实体之间如何发挥魔法效果进行了大量的思考。",
	"That said, you could go a different way, and treat magic and the energies created by Ancients devices as fundamentally different.": "这就是说，你可以走另一条路，把魔法和古人设备创造的能量视为根本不同。",
	"It's viable run a game where the technology of the Ancients bypasses warding designed to keep out magic and ignores magic resistance. Using this option means that creatures, such as the previously mentioned devil, would not gain any additional protection from a character using a numenera device on it as they would if resisting a spell.": "在游戏中，古人的技术可以绕过旨在阻挡魔法的防护，并且无视魔法抵抗，这是可行的。使用这个选项意味着生物，比如之前提到的魔鬼，不会像抵抗法术那样，从使用numenera装置的角色那里获得任何额外的保护。",
	"On the other hand, powerful creatures introduced in this book would not have their attacks treated as if magical (assuming you ignored the ability in their stat block indicating to the contrary). This would render certain extant magical creatures, especially those with immunity to nonmagical attacks, as unassailable by some of the most powerful creatures released from the Ancients' caches.": "另一方面，在本书中介绍的强大生物不会被视为具有魔法的攻击（假设你忽略了它们的状态块中显示的相反能力）。这将使某些现存的魔法生物，特别是那些对非魔法攻击具有免疫力的生物，无法被一些从古人的储藏室中释放出来的最强大的生物所攻击。",
	"At least at first. Because such a situation could lead to a variety of interesting stories. For example, some of the powerful entities described in these pages, such as a {@creature quotien|AotA}, would likely undertake a research project to alleviate such a discrepancy immediately. That project might provide some numenera tool able to focus magic, or it might lead the quotien to learn magic for itself or to acquire potent magic items, further empowering it.": "至少在一开始。因为这样的情况可能会导致各种有趣的故事。例如，这些页面中描述的一些强大的实体，如（%0%），可能会立即开展一个研究项目来缓解这种差异。这个项目可能会提供一些能够集中魔法的数位工具，也可能会导致这个quotien自己学习魔法或获得强大的魔法物品，进一步增强它的力量。",
	"Sometimes, the magic-numenera nonequivalence will raise unobvious questions you'll have to be prepared to answer. For instance, if a character gets their hands on a {@item matter evaporator|AotA} cypher and tries to use it on a magical tome specifically ensorcelled to resist normal, non-magical damage, should the matter evaporator simply fail to work on it? The answer might be yes in this case, though it might create a cavity around the tome into which the book drops.": "有时，魔法与数位的不对等性会引起一些不明显的问题，你必须准备好回答。例如，如果一个角色得到了一个{@item matter evaporator|AotA}密文，并试图把它用在一个专门被奉为抵抗正常的、非魔法伤害的魔法巨著上，那么物质蒸发器是不是就应该对它不起作用？在这种情况下，答案可能是肯定的，尽管它可能会在巨著周围形成一个空洞，让书掉进去。",
	"{@book Cyphers|AotA|0|Cyphers} are similar to one-use magic items. In a game where Ancients' caches have opened, many of them might be available for PCs, who can carry only up to three at once before the danger associated with one person carrying too many at once kicks in.": "{@book Cyphers|AotA|0|Cyphers}类似于一次性使用的魔法物品。在游戏中，古人的储藏室已经开放，许多古人的储藏室可能供NPC使用，他们一次最多只能携带三个，然后一个人同时携带太多的相关危险就会开始了。",
	"The idea is that characters should begin to trust that the availability of cyphers is high, allowing them to continually find and use them, without having to hoard. If they do, they might not get to use the next weird, new cypher that's found.": "这个想法是，角色应该开始相信赛博的可用性很高，允许他们不断地找到并使用它们，而不必囤积。如果他们这样做，他们可能无法使用下一个被发现的奇怪的新赛博。",
	"But don't think about cyphers as a requirement for your game; they're a reward! Cyphers are a powerful tool for keeping gameplay fresh and exciting, because by their very nature, they're always changing. Cyphers = Excitement.": "但不要把赛博看作是你的游戏的要求，它们是一种奖励！赛博是保持游戏新鲜度的有力工具，因为它们的本质是不断变化的。赛尔号是保持游戏新鲜和刺激的有力工具，因为就其本质而言，它们总是在变化。回旋镖 = 刺激。",
	"Because they are essentially one-use abilities that characters gain and use over the course of the game, a character's capacity can change from session to session, which means the unexpected is always around the corner.": "因为它们基本上是人物在游戏过程中获得和使用的一次性能力，所以一个人物的能力可以在不同的时段发生变化，这意味着意外总是在拐角处发生。",
	"In game design for any system, one of the most difficult issues of game balance is introducing new PC abilities. It's not enough to think about what it will be like if a PC summons a {@creature callerail|AotA} once, you have to think about what effect it will have that the PC has the ability to summon callerails all the time. Maybe even every encounter. But cyphers, being one-use, don't cause this problem.": "在任何系统的游戏设计中，最困难的游戏平衡问题之一是引入新的PC能力。仅仅考虑如果一个PC召唤一次（%0%）会是什么样子是不够的，你必须考虑这个PC一直有召唤召唤物的能力会产生什么影响。甚至可能是每一次遭遇战。但赛弗，作为一次性使用，不会造成这个问题。",
	"Sure, a PC might end up with the ability to take down one really tough challenge with a wink or wave of a weird gizmo, but that's just one challenge of many that the group will face. It's fun, it's invigorating, but it's not unbalancing, because they'll very likely never find such a device again.": "当然，一个人最终可能会有能力通过眨眼或挥动一个奇怪的小工具来解决一个非常艰难的挑战，但这只是小组将面临的众多挑战中的一个。这很有趣，令人振奋，但并不失平衡，因为他们很可能再也找不到这样的设备了。",
	"Plus, cyphers are a way for a player to gain access to fun abilities without having to wait for months of game time to reach the level where it's appropriate for the PC to be able to use a higher-level ability.": "此外，赛弗是一种让玩家获得有趣能力的方法，而不必等待数月的游戏时间来达到适合PC使用更高级别的能力的水平。",
	"Each character has a limit on the number of cyphers they can carry at any given time. The idea is that cyphers are dangerous when gathered together. But this idea is actually only derived common wisdom, some of which might be based on incorrect observations. Although most cyphers are inherently unstable, will there be a terrible explosion if the dwarf gathers three cyphers in their fist at the same time? Probably not. Can a character tuck six pills into a pouch without dying of invisible poisoning? Almost certainly.": "每个角色在任何时候都有携带赛弗的数量限制。这个想法是，赛博在聚集在一起时很危险。但这种想法实际上只是衍生出的普通智慧，其中一些可能是基于不正确的观察。虽然大多数赛尔号本质上是不稳定的，但如果矮人同时在拳头上聚集三个赛尔号，会发生可怕的爆炸吗？可能不会。一个角色可以把六颗药丸塞进一个袋子里而不死于无形的中毒吗？几乎可以肯定。",
	"The limit on cyphers is more of a gameplay mechanism than a setting or flavor issue. Basically, it's bad for the game if PCs hoard cyphers because they're meant to be used. Hoarding cyphers means there will be long stretches of the game without cypher use, and at some point, there probably will be a moment with far too much cypher use.": "对赛博的限制更多的是一种游戏机制，而不是一个设定或风味问题。基本上，如果NPC囤积赛尔菲，这对游戏是不利的，因为它们本来就应该被使用。囤积赛博意味着游戏中会有很长一段时间没有赛博的使用，而且在某些时候，可能会出现赛博使用过多的情况。",
	"Which is why the {@book cypher limit|AotA|0|cypher limit} exists, and the related {@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA|Cypher Danger Table}.": "这就是为什么{@book cypher limit|AotA|0|cypher limit}存在，以及相关的{@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA|Cypher Danger Table}。",
	"Here are some alternative ideas on how to limit cyphers and keep the same spirit of gameplay:": "这里有一些关于如何限制cyphers和保持相同的游戏精神的替代想法。",
	"Give an expiration date to each cypher, citing their instability. However, that requires a lot of bookkeeping.": "给每个密码器一个有效期，引用它们的不稳定性。然而，这需要大量的簿记工作。",
	"Characters who bear more than their cypher limit always act at disadvantage. This method is certainly simple.": "承担超过其 cypher 限制的角色总是处于不利地位。这种方法当然很简单。",
	"The perils of having too many cyphers could be handled entirely through roleplaying, with characters acting out of caution and outright fear of something they know to be dangerous.": "拥有太多赛博的危险可以完全通过角色扮演来处理，人物出于谨慎和对他们知道是危险的东西的彻底恐惧而行动。",
	"Just ignore all the weird cypher rules and treat cyphers like one-shot magic items.": "只要忽略所有奇怪的赛博规则，把赛博当作一次性的魔法物品。",
	"The descriptions of the cyphers, relics, and other numenera items in this book include a default shape and sometimes material. However, these wonders of the Ancients can vary widely in appearance, for reasons lost to the epochs. The following sections allow a GM to quickly come up with an interesting and unique description for numenera items to keep each discovery new, weird, and mysterious; roll once on the {@table Device Shapes|AotA} options and once on the {@table Device Materials|AotA} options when PCs discover a device of the numenera.": "本书中对青铜器、遗物和其他数字物品的描述包括一个默认的形状，有时还包括材料。然而，这些古人的奇迹在外观上可以有很大的不同，原因已被时代所遗忘。下面的章节可以让GM快速地为numenera物品想出有趣而独特的描述，以保持每次发现都是新的、奇怪的和神秘的；当NPC发现numenera装置时，在{@table Device Shapes|AotA}选项和{@table Device Materials|AotA}选项上各滚动一次。",
	"These entries describe the item in the most general, broad terms, and these should just be the baseline or quick description of the object, with the actual object looking more irregular and weird—something that generally looks like a cube might have some rounded edges, small spheres on each corner, and a handle extending from one face. Any of these shapes could be decorated with writing, etchings, grooves, ridges, knobs, buttons, unidentifiable lines, and so on. The names for some of these are the English names, and in truth, they are called by other names.": "这些条目以最一般、最广泛的术语描述物品，这些应该只是物品的基线或快速描述，实际的物品看起来更加不规则和怪异--一般看起来像立方体的东西可能有一些圆边，每个角上有小球体，还有一个手柄从一个面上延伸出来。这些形状中的任何一个都可以用文字、蚀刻、凹槽、脊线、旋钮、按钮、无法识别的线条等等来装饰。其中一些的名称是英文名称，事实上，它们还有其他名称。",
	"The {@table Device Materials|AotA|materials} on this table are offered as inspirations when you describe what a numenera device is made of. These entries describe the item's main material in the most general terms. Ancients' objects usually aren't made out of one type of material. A weapon might have a synth shell and a leather handle, but its core is probably a piece of metal or a crystal. A healing device might be an injectable liquid encased in a pouch or absorbed into a fungal pod. Most items include some kind of circuitry, controls, and perhaps even an illuminated display, which may be a very different material than the main device. In the same way that the GM quickly describes a vehicle as \"bright red, made of synth, with multiple wings,\" the players should understand that parts of the vehicle aren't red and aren't made of synth.": "这个表格上的{@table Device Materials|AotA|materials}是在你描述一个numenera设备是由什么组成时提供的灵感。这些条目以最概括的方式描述了物品的主要材料。古人的物品通常不是由一种类型的材料制成的。一件武器可能有一个合成物外壳和一个皮革手柄，但其核心可能是一块金属或水晶。一个治疗装置可能是包裹在袋子里的注射液，或者是被吸收到一个真菌舱里。大多数物品都包括某种电路、控制装置，也许还有一个发光的显示屏，它的材料可能与主装置截然不同。就像GM很快将一辆车描述为 \"鲜红色，由合成物制成，有多个翅膀 \"一样，玩家应该明白这辆车的某些部分并不是红色的，也不是由合成物制成。",
	"If you need an object AC for one of the options provided on the materials table, the default is AC 15, even for things that may seem like they should be less, like a leaf or a mushroom; these materials are not {@i actually} those things, they are merely akin to them.": "如果你需要材料表上提供的某个选项的物体AC，默认是AC15，即使是那些看起来应该更少的东西，比如一片叶子或一个蘑菇；这些材料不是（%0%）那些东西，它们只是类似于它们。",
	"Sometimes, a device is described as metallic, glass, or crystal, in which case regular object statistics apply, including the appropriate object AC. Other times, it's not clear what substance a numenera device is crafted from because it is a completely manufactured material. The catch-all term for such material is \"synth.\" But if a PC wants to saw through a synth tube, shatter a synth canister, or smash a device of synth that opens a portal into a previously curled-up dimension, they need to know its object AC.": "有时，一个装置被描述为金属、玻璃或水晶，在这种情况下，常规的物体统计适用，包括适当的物体交流。其他时候，不清楚一个numenera装置是由什么物质制作的，因为它是一种完全人造的材料。这种材料的总称是 \"合成物\"。但如果一个人想锯开一个合成物管，打碎一个合成物罐，或者砸碎一个能打开进入先前蜷缩维度的传送门的合成物装置，他们就需要知道它的物体交流。",

	"The nature of the return of the Ancients, and the basis for much of their incomprehensible technology, relates to the subtle manipulation of tiny, previously inaccessible alternate planes of existence and limited dimensions not previously recognized as being part of the normal cosmology. If you want to play with that concept more than simply use it as an interesting bit of lore, you can introduce the concept of rifts into your game as PCs use the strange cyphers, relics, and iron flesh that they find.": "古人回归的本质，以及他们许多难以理解的技术的基础，与微妙地操纵微小的、以前无法进入的另一个存在平面和有限的维度有关，这些维度以前并不被认为是正常宇宙学的一部分。如果你想更多地利用这个概念，而不仅仅是把它作为一个有趣的传说，你可以在游戏中引入裂缝的概念，让PC使用他们发现的奇怪的赛博、遗物和铁肉。",
	"When a relic depletes, it usually just stops working. The same is true of a cypher. If a cypher or relic becomes damaged, it might also stop working. But you have the option to decide that a mishap occurs under such circumstances, creating an accidental rift.": "当一个遗迹耗尽时，它通常会停止工作。赛尔号的情况也是如此。如果一个赛尔号或遗迹受损，它也可能停止工作。但你可以选择决定在这种情况下发生意外，创造一个意外的裂缝。",
	"To check for a rift when a relic depletes, or merely when you judge the situation might cause a chance for a rift to occur, the player makes a rift saving throw. If the roll is 10 or higher, the PC succeeds. Otherwise, they fail. On a failed rift saving throw, a rift event occurs.": "当遗迹耗尽时，或者仅仅是当你判断情况可能导致裂缝发生的机会时，要检查裂缝，玩家要做一个裂缝拯救动作。如果掷出的分数是10或更高，那么玩家就成功了。否则，他们会失败。在裂缝救赎失败的情况下，会发生裂缝事件。",
	"Rift events could include any of the mishaps indicated on the {@table Rift Table|AotA}.": "裂缝事件可能包括{@table Rift Table|AotA}上标明的任何不幸事件。",
	"If the worst should happen, a rip in reality can create a permanent rift. This might lead to another part of the world, to another plane of existence, or have a more subtle, dimensional scrambling effect. If a dimensional scrambling effect occurs, all creatures within a 1-mile-radius sphere centered on the rift—creatures, objects, structures, and so on, including itself—begin to non-destructively merge with an alternate dimension chosen by the GM.": "如果最坏的情况发生，现实中的裂缝可以创造一个永久的裂缝。这可能会通向世界的另一个地方，通向另一个存在平面，或者产生更微妙的维度扰动效应。如果发生了维度扰乱效应，以裂缝为中心的1英里半径范围内的所有生物--生物、物体、结构等等，包括它自己--都会开始无损地与GM选择的另一个维度融合。",
	"This has the effect of creating a wide overlapping zone where things from two dimensions occupy the same area. The mixed environment could run the gamut from placid coexistence to a burned-out dead rift, depending on the nature of the two dimensions that come together. Creatures outside the affected rift in either of the linked dimensions can enter the other dimension if they walk across the affected area from one side to the other. Once the rift is created, undoing it would require extraordinary resources.": "这有创造一个宽阔的重叠区的效果，来自两个维度的东西占据了同一个区域。混合的环境可以从平静的共存到烧毁的死亡裂缝，这取决于两个维度的性质。在受影响的裂缝之外的生物，如果他们从一边走到另一边的受影响区域，可以进入另一个维度。一旦裂缝被创造出来，撤销它将需要非常多的资源。",
	"As PCs gain familiarity with the return of the Ancients, they have the option to develop a talent or gain expertise with the numenera. In other words, you can choose to give characters access to a few new feats.": "随着NPC对 \"古人回归 \"的熟悉，他们可以选择发展一种天赋，或者获得有关数字的专业知识。换句话说，你可以选择让角色获得一些新的功绩。",
	"{@book Chapter 3|AotA|0|Mutations} describes a variety of {@book mutations|AotA|0|Mutations} a player character might gain due to the ineffable energies and biomorphic substances leaking from Ancients devices and suffusing the ruins. An option for {@book beginning play as a mutant|AotA|0|beginning play as a mutant} is outlined.

	"You could handle the situation using one (or both) of the following options.": "你可以使用以下一个（或两个）选项来处理这种情况。",
	"First, you could be completely arbitrary in what happens when characters enter an area you've decided puts them at risk of gaining a mutation. In this case, have them each make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, they only feel nauseated for an hour, and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks during that period.": "首先，当角色进入你认为有可能获得变异的区域时，你可以完全随意地决定发生什么。在这种情况下，让他们每个人都做一个DC15的宪法保护动作。如果成功，他们只会在一小时内感到恶心，并且在这段时间内攻击卷和能力检查中处于劣势。",

The mutations fully develop over the course of four hours, during which time the character is incapacitated.": "如果失败，他们会获得一种变异。掷出以下数据（%0%），看看每个人获得的是哪种变异。变异在四小时内完全发展，在此期间，角色会丧失能力。",
	"Once gained, a mutation is permanent, though in-game developments might offer a character a way to ameliorate or reverse a harmful mutation.": "一旦获得，变异就是永久性的，尽管游戏中的发展可能为角色提供一种改善或逆转有害变异的方法。",
	"A character could potentially develop multiple mutations in this fashion; however, they can never gain more than one powerful mutation at a time, or more than four total mutations at a time.": "一个角色有可能以这种方式发展多种变异；但是，他们每次获得的强大变异永远不会超过一个，或者一次获得的变异总数超过四个。",
	"Even if characters stumble into a mutation by accident, you could allow them to gain some control over the condition once they have some experience with it. The easiest way to do that is to treat that control as the acquisition of a feat.": "即使人物是偶然发现变异的，你也可以让他们在有了一些经验后获得对这种状况的控制权。最简单的方法是将这种控制权视为一种特技的获得。",
	"At certain levels, a character's class provides an Ability Score Improvement feature. Instead of gaining that benefit, a character could gain better control over their mutation by gaining the benefit outlined for beginning play as a mutant, with the following caveat. Instead of starting fresh, when the player chooses a set of abilities, they must incorporate whichever mutation they've already got. So, if the PC has a harmful mutation already, they must choose a set with that kind of mutation listed.

	"You may want to locate Ancients' caches in mysterious, isolated wastelands. Such places might have a reputation as cursed, forbidden, and utterly dangerous, where the very air is filled with sickness and death. We'll call these locations wastelands. And true to the legends, they are dangerous, but not because of magical curses, but because of the Ancients' actions in the unimaginably far past.": "你可能想在神秘的、与世隔绝的荒地上找到古人的藏匿处。这种地方可能有被诅咒、被禁止、完全危险的名声，那里的空气中充满了疾病和死亡。我们将这些地方称为荒地。正如传说中的那样，它们很危险，但不是因为神奇的诅咒，而是因为古人在难以想象的过去的行为。",
	"The Ancient's devices have perhaps become degraded over time through various processes of decomposition and rot, unforeseen interactions, environment, and even unexpected activity of vermin or other creatures. Untended and left to fester, such areas can become a stew of dangerous energies, poisonous substances, disease-producing minerals, corrupt liquids, and materials so weirdly dangerous that understanding exactly how they are warping one's body or mind is difficult for someone who doesn't understand the Ancients' inexplicable technology.": "古人的设备也许随着时间的推移，通过各种分解和腐烂的过程、不可预见的相互作用、环境，甚至是害虫或其他生物的意外活动而变得退化了。如果不加注意，任其发酵，这些地方就会成为危险能量、有毒物质、产生疾病的矿物、腐败的液体和材料的炖品，以至于对于不了解古人莫名其妙的技术的人来说，很难理解它们到底是如何扭曲人的身体或思想的。",

For example, if the hot zone is 60 feet across, the warm zone extends at least another 60 feet beyond that, forming a somewhat irregular ring, or whatever border that makes sense given the source of the contamination. Other planes of existence could be similarly contaminated; a site contaminated with extradimensional technology might have a normal hot zone and a warm zone that bleeds over into adjacent dimensions. The zones usually extend up into the air and down into the ground about one-third to one-half of the zone's horizontal space.": "一个很久以前就停止工作的古人自动装置的热区可能只有10英尺宽，但一个古代建筑的残余物，在那里高度挥发的外来物质可能有100英尺或更宽。在热区之外是 \"暖区\"，这是一个直径为热区2到3倍的区域，那里的物质比较分散，不那么危险。例如，如果热区有60英尺宽，暖区至少再延伸60英尺，形成一个有点不规则的环，或者考虑到污染源的任何边界。其他存在的平面也可能受到类似的污染；一个被次元技术污染的地方可能有一个正常的热区和一个渗入邻近次元的温暖区。这些区域通常延伸到空中，并向下延伸到地面，约占该区域水平空间的三分之一到二分之一。",

	"An underlying assumption regarding the Ancients is that an inconceivable amount of time has passed since they've been around, and moreover, when they were around, they were active on and off for millions of years.

	"When attempting to grasp what such a campaign would look like, keep in mind two complementary shaping forces. First, the previously mentioned vast amount of time. Imagine if you were to set your campaign on Earth. If Earth were left completely alone for this long, the drastic changes of celestial mechanics, continental drift, erosion, mass extinction, and evolution would render our home unrecognizable.": "当试图把握这样一场运动会是什么样子时，请记住两个互补的塑造力量。首先，前面提到的大量时间。想象一下，如果你将你的运动设定在地球上。如果地球被完全搁置这么久，天体力学、大陆漂移、侵蚀、大规模灭绝和进化的剧烈变化会使我们的家园变得面目全非。",
	"Second, is that of intelligence. Over such a span of time, there might not have been only a single monoculture. Though described as the Ancients, these entities are perhaps composed of many civilizations that rose (or arrived), flourished, and advanced to incredible power. Then they either declined or left, never to return, except in the form of leftovers, refuse, and prizes in their caches.": "第二，是智慧的问题。在这样一个时间跨度中，可能不只有一个单一的文化。虽然被描述为古人，但这些实体可能是由许多文明组成的，这些文明崛起（或到达）、繁荣，并发展到令人难以置信的力量。然后，他们要么衰落，要么离开，再也没有回来，除了在他们的储藏室里的剩饭、垃圾和奖品的形式。",
	"This is really more about setting expectations than about laying hard and fast rules. But here are a few precepts you might use to undergird your own brand-new science-fantasy Ancients-related campaign. One or more of them could be true, particularly if we assume that there were multiple civilizations of \"Ancients.\"": "这其实更多的是关于设定期望，而不是制定硬性规定。但是，这里有几条戒律，你可以用来支撑你自己全新的科学幻想的古人相关活动。其中一个或多个可能是真的，特别是如果我们假设有多个 \"古人 \"文明。",
	"The Ancients' civilization lay at the center of a galactic (or perhaps intergalactic) space-faring empire.": "古人的文明位于一个银河系（或许是银河系）航天帝国的中心。",
	"The Ancients wielded the power of planetary engineering and stellar lifting.": "古人挥舞着行星工程和恒星提升的力量。",
	"The Ancients had knowledge of the fundamental forces of reality and could alter those forces as they wished. The very laws of physics were theirs to play with, like toys. This likely strayed somewhat into magic, even if the Ancients never saw it as such.": "古人对现实的基本力量有所了解，并能按照他们的意愿改变这些力量。物理学的规律是他们可以玩的，就像玩具一样。这很可能在某种程度上偏离了魔法，即使古人从未这样看待它。",
	"The Ancients filled the world with invisible, molecule-sized machines called nanites (or nanomachines) that could deconstruct and reconstruct matter and manipulate energy. (Is this what magic really is? Your answer may differ based on where you want your new campaign to go.)": "古人让世界充满了看不见的、分子大小的机器，称为纳米人（或纳米机器），可以解构和重建物质并操纵能量。(这就是真正的魔法吗？你的答案可能会因你想让你的新运动走向何方而有所不同）。",
	"The Ancients explored the multiverse of other dimensions, parallel universes, and alternate levels of reality.": "古人探索了其他维度的多元宇宙、平行宇宙和现实的另一层次。",
	"At least some of the Ancients were not humanoid.": "至少有些古人不是人形。",
	"In your science-fantasy campaign setting, is it common knowledge that the Ancients existed, or is it a secret, only just now being discovered—perhaps by the PCs? While the default assumption of this book is the latter, you could certainly create a setting like the former. Terry Brook's classic fantasy {@i The Sword of Shannara} is built on that premise.": "在你的科学幻想活动设定中，古人的存在是众所周知的，还是一个秘密，只是现在才被发现--也许是被NPC发现？虽然本书的默认假设是后者，但你当然可以创建一个类似前者的设定。特里-布鲁克的经典奇幻小说（%0%）就是建立在这个前提上的。",
	"In a campaign where the Ancients are known to some or maybe even most, stories and legends of their existence would likely be mixed in with the myths of gods and demons typical to a fantasy setting. Locations where caches or remnants of the Ancients' work might be seen as holy sites, cursed locales, or forbidden \"no man's lands.\"": "在一些甚至大多数人都知道古人的活动中，关于他们存在的故事和传说很可能会与奇幻环境中典型的神和魔的神话混在一起。有古人作品的藏品或遗迹的地方可能被视为圣地、被诅咒的地方或被禁止的 \"无人之境\"。",
	"From time to time, in such a setting, cyphers or other numenera items would find their way into treasure hoards or into the hands of rich or powerful NPCs. Perhaps the evil wizard has a relic that allows him to defy gravity. Perhaps an ancient dragon has some iron flesh enhancements, mutations, or both.": "在这样的背景下，赛普斯或其他数字物品会不时地出现在宝藏中，或落入富有或强大的NPC手中。也许邪恶的巫师有一个遗物，可以让他藐视重力。也许一条古龙有一些铁质的肉体强化物、变异物，或者两者都有。",
	"Where does your new science-fantasy campaign take place? Many science-fantasies are sited on Earth in the very far future, after a singularity or other technological advance has occurred that eclipses modern understanding. Alternatively, you could take an existing fantasy setting (one of your own creation, one from your favorite fantasy fiction, or one produced to be a campaign setting) and change things so that the Ancients and their technology are assumed to exist.": "你的新科学幻想活动发生在哪里？许多科学幻想故事都发生在非常遥远的未来的地球上，在一个奇点或其他技术进步发生后，使现代人的认识变得模糊。另外，你也可以采用一个现有的幻想背景（一个你自己创造的，一个你最喜欢的幻想小说中的，或者一个被制作成活动背景的），并改变事情，使古人和他们的技术被假定存在。",
	"If you decide to use the modern world but set some time in the far future, you have the luxury of re-arranging things to demonstrate massive energies were used in the past to re-engineer the planet. For instance, maybe most of the land mass has been formed into a gigantic supercontinent, leaving the rest of the globe to the mercy of a single ocean dotted with islands. In addition to the moon appearing smaller than in the modern era because its orbit is wider, it might be built up with visible structures that glow with millions of lights. If enough time has passed from the modern era to the time when you set your campaign, a day will be a few hours longer than 24. And so on.": "如果你决定使用现代世界，但把时间设定在遥远的未来，你就可以重新安排事情，以证明过去曾用大量的能量来重新设计这个星球。例如，也许大部分的陆地已经形成了一个巨大的超级大陆，而将地球的其余部分留给了点缀着岛屿的单一海洋来摆布。除了月球因其轨道更宽而显得比现代更小之外，它还可能被建立起可见的结构，发出数以百万计的光芒。如果从现代到你设定活动的时间有足够的时间，一天会比24小时长几个小时。以此类推。",
	"You could decide to site your campaign someplace else, or even somewhere completely artificial, though this might not be immediately realized by players. A few options, among many possibilities, are:": "你可以决定把你的活动放在别的地方，甚至是完全人为的地方，尽管玩家可能不会立即意识到这一点。在众多的可能性中，有几个选择是。",
	"On a terraformed moon of another planet in the solar system.": "在太阳系中另一个行星的一个畸形的卫星上。",
	"In a generation starship moving through deep space, so large that residents don't understand they don't live on a planet.": "在一代星际飞船中，在深空中移动，如此之大，以至于居民不明白他们并不是生活在一个星球上。",
	"On an artificial megastructure like a Dyson Sphere, a Ringworld, or an Alderson Disk.": "在像戴森球、环形世界或阿尔德森盘这样的人工巨型基础设施上。",
	"In a virtual reality environment, where nearly anything might be possible, until the glitches set in.": "在虚拟现实环境中，几乎任何事情都可能发生，直到出现故障。",
	"On a world orbiting another star originally colonized by space travel, the knowledge of which has since been lost.": "在一个围绕另一颗恒星运行的世界上，最初是通过太空旅行殖民的，后来对这个世界的了解已经消失。",
	"In the cracks of a massive alien machine whose purpose isn't understood.": "在一个巨大的外星机器的缝隙中，其目的不被理解。",
	"On a traditional fantasy world where technologically advanced entities have recently made themselves known.": "在一个传统的奇幻世界里，技术先进的实体最近已为人所知。",
	"The people and creatures you populate your brand-new campaign with are probably ignorant of the true history of the world, with some exceptions. That's because to be a science-{@i fantasy}, knowledge is lost, and history becomes mythology. In other words, the relics of the Ancients are just that—no one in the modern times of the setting is producing these kinds of devices. People use whatever cobbled resources they can pull from the detritus of an earlier science-enriched (or science-devastated) world, but they can't make new things or even truly understand the principles behind what they find.": "你在你的全新战役中填充的人和生物可能对世界的真实历史一无所知，除了一些例外。这是因为要成为科学-{@i fantasy}，知识就会丢失，而历史就会变成神话。换句话说，古人的遗物就是这样--在设定的现代，没有人在生产这类设备。人们使用他们能从早期科学丰富（或科学破坏）的世界的残骸中提取的任何拼凑的资源，但他们不能制造新的东西，甚至不能真正理解他们发现的东西背后的原理。",
	"All of which is to say that your player characters probably have a basic medieval understanding of the world. They won't immediately realize that the wonders around them are not the result of magic, meddling gods, and curses, but perhaps the fallout of an age where mastery of knowledge and tools put people on par with deities.": "所有这些都是说，你的玩家角色可能对这个世界有一个基本的中世纪理解。他们不会立即意识到他们周围的奇迹并不是魔法、爱管闲事的神和诅咒的结果，而可能是一个掌握知识和工具使人们与神灵相提并论的时代所带来的后果。",
	"The basic conflict of a science-fantasy setting is that there are undiscovered places that cry out for exploration. Why is the setting the way it is? Is there any record of what happened that can be found or pieced together? And if some kind of lingering danger persists in the world, is there a means lost in some high-technology ruin that can ameliorate it?": "科学幻想设定的基本冲突是，有一些未被发现的地方，呼唤着探索。为什么设定是这样的？是否有任何可以找到或拼凑起来的记录？如果世界上仍然存在某种挥之不去的危险，那么在一些高科技的废墟中是否有一种可以改善它的手段？",
	"Here are a few specific conflicts, out of a limitless number that are possible, that you can throw at your players.": "下面是一些具体的冲突，在无限多的可能中，你可以把它们扔给你的球员。",

	"A flying structure of unknown provenance, apparently adrift and powerless, plows into an inhabited area, and rescue of survivors becomes an issue, but strange creatures/objects are coming out of the structure.": "一个来历不明的飞行结构，显然是漂流和无力的，坠入一个有人居住的地区，救援幸存者成为一个问题，但奇怪的生物/物体从结构中出来。",
	"A sage offers a mighty reward to the first person to bring them a relic from the Tomb of the Machine.": "一位圣人为第一个从机器之墓中带来遗物的人提供了丰厚的奖励。",
	"An NPC puts on a gleaming set of whirring armor, gaining amazing new abilities, but uses them to become a warlord.": "一个NPC穿上了一套闪闪发光的呼呼作响的盔甲，获得了惊人的新能力，却用它们成为了一个军阀。",
	"A curse or sickness brought up out of a ruin slowly petrifies people into reddish crystal images of themselves, humming with beautiful music.": "从废墟中带出的诅咒或疾病，慢慢地将人们石化成自己的红色水晶形象，哼唱着美妙的音乐。",
	"A strange device can create machine duplicates of anyone that gets too near, even duplicates of other duplicates, creating a growing city of similar beings that continues to swell.": "一个奇怪的装置可以创造出任何太靠近的人的机器复制体，甚至是其他复制体的复制体，创造出一个不断膨胀的类似生物的城市。",
	"Strange creatures with odd devices are moving into the area. There have been a few skirmishes. Will there be peace or war?": "有奇怪装置的奇怪生物正在进入该地区。已经发生了一些小规模的冲突。将会有和平还是战争？",
	"NPCs that commonly tunnel and mine below the earth discover a massive Ancients device, which they decide to wake and try and use as a weapon against their ancestral foes, against whom they nurture a long-standing grudge.": "经常在地底挖隧道和采矿的NPC发现了一个巨大的古人装置，他们决定唤醒这个装置，并试图用它作为武器来对付他们的祖先的敌人，他们对这些敌人怀有长期的怨恨。",
	"Weird storms that come complete with energy creatures roll down from the oddly angular mountains every few years. When people are attacked by the energy creatures, afterward they have memories they didn't previously, usually of a distant gate that creaks ominously open, a few inches more each year.": "每隔几年，怪异的风暴就会伴随着能量生物从棱角分明的山上滚下来。当人们被能量生物攻击时，之后他们就会有以前没有的记忆，通常是一个遥远的大门吱吱地打开，每年多开几英寸。",
	"Colossal constructs begin tearing apart the land, sending massive chunks into the sky using newly assembled towers that reach to the heavens. Will they stop, or will they go on until the entire land is disassembled?": "巨大的建筑开始撕裂土地，用新组装的高塔将巨大的块状物送上天空，直达天堂。他们会停下来，还是继续下去，直到整个土地被拆解？",
	"A being from a heretofore unknown plane of existence appears, quickly gaining the reputation of a prophet of doom. It warns that danger approaches from a direction that no one can see, and that to protect against it, people must unite and build a strange machine under its specific direction.": "一个来自前所未知的存在平面的生物出现了，并迅速获得了厄运预言家的声誉。它警告说，危险正从一个没有人能够看到的方向逼近，为了保护它，人们必须团结起来，在它的具体指导下建造一台奇怪的机器。",
	"A region of temporal anomalies begins to spread, possibly because of a fracture in a vast device that hums and shudders deep underground.": "一个时空异常的区域开始蔓延，可能是因为地下深处一个巨大的装置出现断裂，发出嗡嗡的震动。",
	"The numenera is weird. Purposefully so; all the lore and understanding that traditionally accompanies the presentation of a particular creature or location—including its history, motives understandable by humanlevel intelligences, and a sense that what is seen is base reality—isn't usually the case when it comes to the numenera. A PC may never know why a {@creature philethis|AotA} appeared to it one day to warn them of an impending event, or even if the event is something that already happened epochs earlier.": "数字世界很奇怪。故意如此；所有传统上伴随着介绍特定生物或地点的传说和理解--包括它的历史、人类级别的智能体可以理解的动机，以及一种所看到的是基本现实的感觉--在涉及到numenera时通常不是这样的。一个人可能永远不知道为什么有一天会有一个{@creature philethis|AotA}出现在它面前，警告他们一个即将发生的事件，甚至不知道这个事件是否是在几个世纪前就已经发生的事情。",
	"Which is why we've assembled several additional suggestions, guidelines, and even some robust tables to further help incorporate these concepts into your existing or brand-new 5E campaign.": "这就是为什么我们收集了一些额外的建议、指南，甚至一些强大的表格，以进一步帮助将这些概念纳入你现有的或全新的5E活动。",
	"{@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA} introduces a couple of additional mechanics to a 5E game for use with cyphers (you can only carry so many at a time) and relics (depletion rolls). If you're interested in trying another new twist, one you can use to tweak the narrative, try GM intrusions.": "{@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA}为5E游戏引入了一些额外的机制，用于赛博（你一次只能携带这么多）和遗物（耗尽卷）的使用。如果你有兴趣尝试另一个新的转折点，一个你可以用来调整叙事的转折点，可以试试GM入侵。",
	"At any time, the GM can introduce an unexpected complication for a character—this is called a GM intrusion. When a GM intrudes in this manner, they must give that character 2 inspiration. That player, in turn, must immediately give one of those inspiration to another player and justify the gift (perhaps the other player had a good idea, told a funny joke, performed an action that saved a life, and so on).": "在任何时候，GM都可以为一个角色引入一个意想不到的复杂情况--这被称为GM的入侵。当GM以这种方式闯入时，他们必须给该角色2个灵感。反过来，该玩家必须立即将其中一个灵感给另一个玩家，并说明礼物的理由（也许另一个玩家有一个好主意，讲了一个有趣的笑话，做了一个救人的动作，等等）。",
	"Often, the GM intrudes when a player attempts an action that, according to the rules, should be an automatic success. However, the GM is free to intrude at other times. As a general rule, the GM should intrude at least once each session, but no more than once or twice each session per character.": "通常情况下，当玩家尝试一个行动时，GM就会介入，而根据规则，这个行动应该是自动成功的。然而，GM也可以在其他时候自由介入。作为一般规则，GM应该在每个会话中至少介入一次，但每个角色在每个会话中不超过一次或两次。",
	"Anytime the GM intrudes, the player can spend 1 inspiration to refuse the intrusion, though that also means they don't get the 2 inspiration. If the player has no inspiration to spend, they can't refuse the intrusion.": "任何时候，当GM入侵时，玩家可以花费1个灵感来拒绝入侵，尽管这也意味着他们不能得到2个灵感。如果玩家没有灵感可以花，他们就不能拒绝入侵。",
	"Finally, as is normally the case, players can't keep more than 1 inspiration between game sessions.": "最后，与通常情况一样，玩家在游戏会话之间不能保留超过1个灵感。",
	"Through skill and the aid of another character, a character seems likely to easily scale a wall. But the GM intrudes and says, \"Just as you're about to reach the top, a bit of the crumbling wall gives way.\" This requires that the PC make a Dexterity saving throw or fall. But because the GM intruded, the character gains 2 inspiration. They immediately give one of those inspiration to another player.": "通过技巧和另一个角色的帮助，一个角色似乎很容易就能爬上一堵墙。但是，GM闯进来说：\"就在你即将到达顶峰的时候，有点摇摇欲坠的墙让开了。\" 这就要求PC做一个灵巧的拯救动作，否则就会掉下去。但是由于GM的介入，这个角色获得了2个灵感。他们立即把其中一个灵感给了另一个玩家。",
	"During a fight, a PC swings their axe and damages a foe with a slice across the shoulder. The GM intrudes by saying that the foe turned just as the axe struck, wrenching the weapon from the character's grip and sending it clattering across the floor. Because the GM intruded, the PC gains 2 inspiration, and they immediately give one of those inspiration to another player. Now the character must deal with the dropped weapon, perhaps drawing a different weapon or using their next turn to scramble after the axe.": "在一场战斗中，一名PC挥舞着他们的斧头，在敌人的肩膀上砍了一刀。GM说敌人在斧头劈下时转过身来，把武器从角色的手中夺了过来，并把它摔在地上。由于GM的介入，PC获得了2个灵感，并且他们立即将其中一个灵感给了另一个玩家。现在，这个角色必须处理掉落的武器，也许可以拔出另一件武器，或者用下一个回合来追赶斧头。",
	"As we stated earlier, some material in this book originally appeared in the standalone science-fantasy RPG, Numenera. Converting between two different game systems isn't always straightforward. Hundreds of decisions were made on how a particular Numenera ability or effect—which uses the Cypher System as an underlying rule system—should appear in a 5E context. Lots of information is implicitly coded into a Cypher System level that helps a GM handle all kinds of different situations, should any question arise.": "正如我们之前所说，本书的一些材料最初出现在独立的科学幻想RPG游戏《Numenera》中。在两个不同的游戏系统之间进行转换并不总是简单的。对于一个特定的Numenera能力或效果--它使用Cypher系统作为基础规则系统--应该如何出现在5E背景下，我们做了数百个决定。很多信息都隐含在Cypher系统等级中，如果出现任何问题，可以帮助GM处理各种不同的情况。",
	"The 5E ruleset relies on similar predictive qualities, of course, but it delivers that game information to the GM and players differently, using a formal and in-depth method. In a 5E game, you can't get away with introducing a brand-new NPC and simply giving them a level, or assigning a level to an effect or area, and having that dictate an array of basic parameters.": "当然，5E规则集依赖于类似的预测性，但它以不同的方式向GM和玩家提供游戏信息，使用正式和深入的方法。在5E游戏中，你不可能在引入一个全新的NPC时简单地给他们一个等级，或者给一个效果或区域分配一个等级，并让它决定一系列的基本参数。",
	"Specific statistics—usually called stat blocks—are expected for each creature and NPC in the 5E ruleset. The stat blocks provide essential information that can't be gleaned simply by checking the monster's challenge (though that's a great start). All questions about DCs, effect ranges and areas, hit points, specific stats, and more are present in every 5E monster's entry. If your players run into a {@creature progenitor|AotA}, as the GM you not only expect to see the monster's stat block, but also the stat block for the progenitor's spawn that might burst from the egg sack bulging on the monster's belly.": "在5E的规则集中，每个生物和NPC都有特定的统计数据--通常称为统计块--。统计块提供的基本信息不能仅仅通过检查怪物的挑战来收集（尽管这是一个很好的开始）。所有关于DCs、效果范围和区域、命中率、具体的统计资料等问题都存在于每个5E怪物的条目中。如果你的玩家遇到了一个{@creature progenitor|AotA}，作为GM，你不仅要看到怪物的状态块，还要看到可能从怪物肚子上鼓起的蛋袋中爆出的祖先的卵子的状态块。",
	"A similar situation holds true for special objects such as magic items. \"Magic\" isn't what the Ancients relied upon to achieve their wondrous abilities, though the principle is similar enough that certain especially powerful Ancients creatures are {@footnote treated as if magical|More on the topic of treating some powerful numenera creatures and objects as if magical is discussed under {@book Magic vs. the Ancients|AotA|1Magic vs. the Ancients} as the default for inclusion in a 5E game.": "类似的情况也适用于魔法物品等特殊物品。\"魔法 \"并不是古人赖以实现其神奇能力的东西，尽管其原理足够相似，某些特别强大的古人生物被（%0%）作为默认纳入5E游戏中。",
	"Likewise, the remnants of their works—primarily in the form of {@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh}—are in effect equally \"magical.\" That's especially true for ingame characters who find a relic, maybe an {@item endless stomach|AotA}, that allows them to eat anything they can put in their mouth, or a {@item mind imager|AotA} cypher, which when attached to someone's heads, shows images of what they're thinking. All of which is to say that the entries for cyphers, relics, and iron flesh use a similar format as 5E magic items, with a few exceptions described in that chapter.": "同样，他们作品的残余物--主要是以{@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh}的形式--实际上也同样 \"有魔力\"。这对于游戏中的角色来说尤其如此，他们发现了一个遗物，也许是一个（%1%），可以让他们吃任何可以放进嘴里的东西，或者是一个（%2%） cypher，当它贴在某人的头上时，会显示出他们所想的图像。所有这些都是说，赛博、遗物和铁肉的条目使用了与5E魔法物品类似的格式，但该章中描述了一些例外。",
	"For GMs who prefer a more traditional randomization based on rarity, this appendix separates the {@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh} into nine different tables (A through I) arranged by rarity.": "对于那些喜欢更传统的基于稀有度的随机化的GM来说，本附录将{@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh}分离成九个不同的表格（A到I），按稀有度排列。",

	"{@b Magnetic flesh:} You attract or repel metal when you desire. Small metal objects cling to you. Climbing on metal doesn't cost you extra movement and you add your proficiency bonus to climbing rolls on metal. You have advantage on keeping your grip on a metal item. As a reaction (which you take when you are hit by an attack from a metal opponent or metal weapon) you can give yourself a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack.": "{@b Magnetic flesh:}当你想要时，你会吸引或排斥金属。小的金属物体会依附于你。在金属上攀爬不需要花费你额外的动作，而且你在攀爬金属的过程中会增加你的熟练度。你在保持对金属物品的抓握上有优势。作为一种反应（当你被金属对手或金属武器的攻击击中时，你会采取这种反应），你可以给自己一个+2的攻击力奖励，以对抗触发的攻击。",

	"{@b Telekinesis:} As an action, you can activate your ability to exert force on objects within 25 feet. This ability lasts for one hour. You can use this force to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, as an action you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself, or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet. Any telekinetic action that would require a Strength check uses your Intelligence. This mutation lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it's not a means of attack. You can't use this mutation to move your own body or anything you are holding or carrying. The power lasts for one hour. After you've used telekinesis for an hour, it has disadvantage until you complete a short or long rest.": "{@b Telekinesis:}作为一个动作，你可以启动你的能力，对25英尺内的物体施加力量。这种能力持续一个小时。你可以用这种力来移动物体，推压物体，等等。例如，作为一个动作，你可以举起并拉动范围内任何一个轻的物体，或者移动一个重的物体（如一件家具）约10英尺。任何需要力量检查的心灵感应动作都会用到你的智力。这种变异缺乏精细的控制，无法挥舞武器或以极快的速度移动物体，所以在大多数情况下，它不是一种攻击手段。你不能用这种变异来移动你自己的身体或你持有或携带的东西。这种能力持续一个小时。在你使用心灵感应一小时后，在你完成短期或长期的休息之前，它都有劣势。",

You can't perceive anything or take actions (other than continuing to move through the barrier) until you pass entirely through the barrier. You can't pass through barriers made of energy (such as wall of fire) or force. After you use phase shifting, you have disadvantage on all rolls until you complete a short or long rest.

	"{@b Power device:} As an action, you can spend Hit Dice to recharge an iron flesh device or numenera relic. For an uncommon item, adding 1 charge (or one use for a depleted relic) costs 1 Hit Die, a rare item costs 2 Hit Dice, a very rare item costs 3 Hit Dice, and a legendary item costs 4 Hit Dice. After you've used this mutation, you have disadvantage on all Intelligence rolls and can't use it again until you've completed a short or long rest.": "{@b Power device:}作为一个行动，你可以花费命中率来为一个铁肉装置或numenera遗物充电。对于一个不常见的物品来说，增加一次充电（或者对于一个耗尽的遗物来说是一次使用）需要花费1个命中率骰子，一个稀有物品需要花费2个命中率骰子，一个非常稀有的物品需要花费3个命中率骰子，而一个传奇物品需要花费4个命中率骰子。在你使用这个突变之后，你在所有的智力测验中都处于劣势，并且在你完成短期或长期休息之前不能再次使用它。",
	"{@b Drain power:} As an action, you can touch an iron flesh device or numenera relic, draining its power and using it to heal yourself. The number of hit points you regain depends on the rarity of the device or relic: {@dice 1d8} for common or uncommon, {@dice 2d8} for rare, {@dice 3d8} for very rare, or {@dice 5d8} for legendary. You recover these hit points at a rate of {@dice 1d8} per round, and you must use your action each round and maintain concentration; if you are interrupted, the healing ends. This completely drains the device, even if interrupted before you're finished (at the GM's discretion, an item may retain some charges or only have to make a depletion roll if partially drained). Because you need to maintain contact and concentration with the item to use this ability, it is all but impossible to use it on an item held or worn by an unwilling creature.": "{@b Drain power:}作为一个动作，你可以触摸一个铁肉装置或numenera遗迹，消耗它的力量，用它来治疗自己。你恢复的命中率取决于设备或遗物的稀有程度：普通或不普通的为（%1%），稀有的为（%2%），非常稀有的为（%3%），传奇的为（%4%）。你以每回合{@dice 1d8}的速度恢复这些命中率，你必须每回合使用你的行动并保持专注；如果你被打断，治疗就会结束。这将完全耗尽设备，即使在你完成之前被打断（由GM决定，一个项目可以保留一些电荷，或者如果部分耗尽，只需要进行耗尽卷）。因为你需要与物品保持接触并集中注意力来使用这个能力，所以几乎不可能对一个不愿意的生物所持有或佩戴的物品使用这个能力。",
	"{@b Regeneration:} Whenever you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points, add your proficiency bonus to each Hit Die you roll for healing.": "{@b Regeneration:}每当你花费命中率来恢复命中率时，在你为治疗而掷出的每个命中率上加上你的熟练度奖励。",

As your action, you can make a bite attack that deals {@damage 1d4} piercing damage. Your bite has the finesse and light weapon properties. You have proficiency with this attack. You can also speak with two voices at once, although this doesn't allow you to cast two spells or use two voice-based abilities at the same time.": "{@b Extra mouth:} 你的手上、脸上或肚子上多了一张嘴。这张嘴里长满了锋利的牙齿。作为你的行动，你可以进行一次咬人攻击，造成{@damage 1d4}穿刺伤害。你的咬合具有精巧和轻型武器的特性。你可以熟练掌握这种攻击。你也可以同时用两种声音说话，不过这并不允许你同时施放两个法术或使用两个基于声音的能力。",

	"{@b Tendrils instead of fingers:} Your fingers are tendrils 12 inches long. Climbing doesn't cost you extra movement and you add your proficiency bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks for climbing and to rolls to grasp things or keep your grip.
