	"Big and small, simple or intricate, tattoos can be an excellent way to develop a character's personality. Whether you want to give the mercenary your players are talking to an air of mystery, or really delve into your rogue's tragic backstory, there are as many reasons to give a character a tattoo as there are for a person to choose one themselves. On the following pages, you will find roll tables for the tattoo's design, placement, minor magical properties and, if you choose, more beneficial magical enchantments. You can use these tables to randomly generate tattoos, or choose whatever design, placement and effect you think would best suit the character.": "大的和小的，简单的和复杂的，纹身都可以成为发展角色个性的绝佳方式。无论你是想给你的玩家交谈的佣兵以神秘感，还是想深入了解你的流氓的悲惨背景故事，都有很多理由给一个角色纹身，就像一个人自己选择一个一样。在下面几页中，你会发现关于纹身的设计、位置、次要魔法属性以及如果你选择的话，更多有益的魔法属性的滚动表。你可以使用这些表格来随机生成纹身，或者选择你认为最适合这个角色的设计、位置和效果。",

	"One of the most appealing aspects of a tattoo for an adventurer is the fact that they can be imbued with magical properties. On this page you will find two lists of potential enchantments, minor magical properties and advantageous enchantments. Minor enchantments provide flavour, and can be helpful to the creative adventurer in some situations, but do not provide explicit gameplay bonuses. Advantageous enchantments, on the other hand, give statistical bonuses, similar to common and uncommon wondrous items. If you are designing a player character, they may start the game with a tattoo with a minor magical property, but are unlikely to have an advantageous enchantment at this point in their journey. As a Dungeon Master, you can treat tattoos with enchantments as if they were magical items, giving them as rewards, or requiring players to earn them in some way. For example, a village of halflings may have a master tattooist who will only work with those who have helped the community in some way.": "对冒险家来说，纹身最吸引人的地方之一是它们可以被赋予魔法属性。在这一页，你会发现两份潜在的魔法清单，即次要的魔法属性和有利的魔法属性。小魔法提供了风味，在某些情况下对创造性的冒险者有帮助，但不提供明确的游戏奖励。另一方面，优势魔法提供统计学上的奖励，类似于普通和不普通的神奇物品。如果你正在设计一个玩家角色，他们在游戏开始时可能会有一个带有小魔法属性的纹身，但在他们的旅程中不太可能有一个有利的魔法。作为地下城管理员，你可以把带有魔法的纹身当作魔法物品，把它们作为奖励，或者要求玩家以某种方式获得它们。例如，一个半身人的村庄可能有一个纹身大师，他只和那些以某种方式帮助过社区的人合作。",
