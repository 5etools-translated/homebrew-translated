The only thing he was able to retrieve was a 2-foot-diam eter silvery disk etched with strange markings. The metal disk is now trapped within the tavern. He suspects it may have triggered the anomaly that engulfed the building.": "诺拉赫认为这口井可能是某种通道，但他们始终无法靠近，无法找到答案。他唯一能够取回的东西是一个2英尺长的银色圆盘，上面刻有奇怪的标记。这个金属盘现在被困在酒馆内。他怀疑可能是它触发了吞噬建筑物的异常现象。",
	"Brandar has lived in Ashstead for ten years and is well-regarded among the townspeople. He believes that the latest anomaly is connected to Naulach's discovery in the rift, given the timing of events. He's more concerned for the few people left trapped within his tavern than the tavern itself—and he worries that unless the source of these anomalies is discovered soon, they're only going to get worse, eventually consuming the entire town.": "布兰达在阿什特德住了十年，在镇民中很有威望。鉴于事件发生的时间，他相信最近的异常情况与诺拉赫在裂缝中的发现有关。比起酒馆本身，他更担心被困在他的酒馆里的几个人--他担心除非这些异常现象的来源很快被发现，否则它们只会越来越糟，最终吞噬整个小镇。",
	"Naulach is an explorer at heart and is close friends with the town sage, Gautia. He's both relieved and regretful that he's the only survivor of his expedition. He provides as much help as he can, but is too unsure of himself to venture out into the mountains again.": "诺拉赫内心是个探险家，与镇上的圣人高提亚是好朋友。他对自己是探险队的唯一幸存者感到欣慰和遗憾。他尽可能地提供帮助，但对自己太不自信，不敢再冒险进入山区。",
	"After the characters hear Naulach's tale, the half-orc suggests that they speak with Gautia, the local sage, who is investigating a similar metal object that fell into town from the mountainside (if they haven't already done so).": "在人物听完诺拉赫的故事后，半兽人建议他们和当地的圣人高蒂亚谈谈，他正在调查一个从山坡上掉到镇上的类似金属物体（如果他们还没有这么做的话）。",
	"Naulach can provide the characters with directions to the mountain rift. He's sure the magical well of energy is connected to the recent anomalies affecting the town. If the characters recover the metallic orb from the crashed construct (see \"Metal Contraption,\" above) and show it to Naulach, the half-orc recognizes the material. He says the creatures that attacked his group were constructed from the same silvery metal, as was the disk he retrieved from that area. Both he and Brandar hope that those trapped within the tavern can survive long enough to be freed from their crystalline prison. Unsure of the fate of his patrons, Brandar asks the characters to waste no time in finding a way to end these anomalies.": "诺拉赫可以为人物提供前往山间裂缝的方向。他确信这口神奇的能量井与最近影响该镇的异常现象有关。如果人物从坠毁的建筑中找到金属球（见上文的 \"金属装置\"）并给诺拉赫看，这个半兽人就能认出这种材料。他说袭击他的队伍的生物是由同样的银色金属构成的，就像他从那片区域取回的磁盘一样。他和布兰达都希望那些被困在酒馆里的人能够存活足够长的时间，以便从他们的水晶监狱中解救出来。由于不确定他的顾客们的命运，布兰达要求这些人物不要浪费时间，找到结束这些异常现象的方法。",
	"The journey from Ashstead to the mountain passage takes three hours. Refer to the Wyrmtail Caverns map for locations. When the characters arrive at the pass, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:": "从阿什斯蒂德到山间通道的旅程需要三个小时。地点请参考Wyrmtail Caverns地图。当人物到达山口时，阅读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"Rocky, uneven terrain leads to a 30-foot-wide breach in the mountain wall. The surface of the ground where the rift begins is a dark grayish hue.": "岩石、不平坦的地形导致山壁上出现一个30英尺宽的裂口。裂口开始的地表是一种深灰色的色调。",
	"If the characters obtained the metallic orb from the construct in Ashstead (see \"Metal Contraption\"), it emits a vibrating pulse when they come within 50 feet of the en trance. The pulse repeats once every 10 seconds. If the character carrying the orb has a passive Perception score of 13 or higher, they can sense the vibration. It can't be felt within dimensional containers such as a {@item bag of holding}.": "如果人物从阿什斯特德的建筑中获得了金属球体（见 \"金属装置\"），那么当他们走到离en trance 50英尺以内时，它就会发出一个振动脉冲。该脉冲每10秒重复一次。如果携带球体的人物的被动感知分数达到13分或更高，他们就能感觉到振动。在维度容器内，如{@item bag of holding}，无法感觉到它。",
	"Beyond the entrance, the passage width narrows to 10 feet and turns into a large tunnel that slopes down into the mountain's underbelly. The orb's pulse gets stronger and faster as the characters progress deeper into the tunnels.": "过了入口，通道宽度缩小到10英尺，变成一条大的隧道，倾斜着进入山的底部。随着人物向隧道深处前进，球体的脉冲越来越强，越来越快。",
	"After a 40-foot-long slope, the tunnel narrows again to a 10-foot width with a 10-foot-high ceiling. From here, there is only one direct path to the center of the breach, and it is shrouded by illusory tunnels made of chaotic magical energy. There are four false branches. The false paths can be spotted with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Due to the magic in the area, spells such as {@spell detect magic} provide no benefit to detecting the false paths.": "在一个40英尺长的斜坡之后，隧道再次缩小到10英尺宽，天花板有10英尺高。从这里，只有一条直接通往破口中心的道路，它被混乱的魔法能量构成的虚幻隧道所笼罩。有四条假的分支。只要成功通过DC16智慧（感知）检查，就能发现这些假路。由于该地区的魔力，诸如（%0%）之类的法术对探测假路没有任何好处。",
	"Coming within 5 feet of any of the false paths (marked on the map) unleashes a wave of magical energy in a 20- foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12 ({@damage 3d8}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. After the energy is released, the illusory path disappears.": "靠近任何一条假路（在地图上标出）的5英尺范围内，会释放出一波20英尺范围内的魔法能量。锥形范围内的每个生物都必须做一个DC14的灵巧救赎，救赎失败会受到12({@damage 3d8})的力量伤害，救赎成功则受到一半的伤害。能量释放后，虚幻之路消失了。",
	"If the characters acquired the metallic orb from the construct in Ashstead, its pulses get stronger the closer it gets to the well (area A3). Characters that discover this phenomenon can use the orb to gain advantage on their checks to spot the false paths.": "如果角色从阿什斯特德的建筑中获得了金属球，那么它的脉冲就会越接近水井（A3区）而越强。发现这一现象的人物可以利用这个球体在发现假路的检查中获得优势。",
	"A 20-foot-diameter circle of swirling blue-white energy covers the center of this chamber's floor. Surges crackle outward like small bolts of lightning, periodically striking the surrounding walls.": "一个直径20英尺的蓝白色能量漩涡圈覆盖了这个房间地板的中心。脉冲像小闪电一样向外噼啪作响，周期性地冲击着周围的墙壁。",
	"While the characters remain in this chamber, they are subject to the random energy surges coming from the well. Each round on initiative count 20, choose a random character and make a ranged attack roll against them with a +6 bonus. On a hit, the character takes 9 ({@damage 2d8}) force damage.": "当人物留在这个房间里时，他们会受到来自井中的随机能量涌动的影响。每一轮在主动性计数20时，随机选择一个角色，并对他们进行一个带有+6奖励的远程攻击卷。一旦命中，该角色将受到9（（%0%））的力量伤害。",
	"A character that uses an action to study the magical surges and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a pattern in the time and placement of the energy surges. Attacks from the surges have disadvantage against characters who succeed on this check.": "一个使用行动来研究魔力涌动的角色，并在DC15智力（调查）检查中成功地注意到能量涌动的时间和位置的模式。来自能量涌动的攻击对成功通过该检定的角色来说是不利的。",
	"When the characters come within 10 feet of the magical well, one {@creature silver hunter|Ar2} per character emerges from it and attack, fighting until destroyed. They are unaffected by the well's magical surges.": "当角色进入魔井10英尺范围内时，每个角色会有一个（%0%）从魔井中出现并进行攻击，战斗直到被消灭。他们不受井的魔力涌动的影响。",
	"The well of energy is a portal that leads into a magitech laboratory (part 3). A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell that the well is an extraplanar portal. If the characters jump into the well, the constructs do not follow.": "能量之井是一个通往魔法实验室的入口（第三部分）。通过DC13智力（阿卡纳）检查成功的人物可以知道这口井是一个星外门户。如果人物跳入井中，构造物就不会跟随。",

	"The walls and ceiling of this area are a mix of stonework and bronze-colored metal. The dark gray stone floor be neath your feet feels similar to hardened clay. Glowing runes run along both sides of the long hallway in a repeating pattern, bathing the passage in dim red light.": "这个区域的墙壁和天花板是石制品和青铜色金属的混合体。你脚下的深灰色石头地板感觉类似于硬化的粘土。发光的符文沿着长长的走廊两边，以重复的模式运行，使通道沐浴在昏暗的红光中。",
	"When the characters arrive, a ghostly image of a human woman appears further down the hallway. She wears garments of a peculiar fashion with a long, flowing jacket. She reaches out to them, appearing to speak, though her voice only makes brief spurts of faint sound before she disappears. The only intelligible word is her name, ''Ellsee.''": "当人物到达时，一个人类女性的幽灵般的形象出现在走廊的更远处。她穿着奇特的服装，有一件长而飘逸的外套。她向他们伸出手，似乎在说话，尽管她的声音在消失之前只发出短暂的微弱声音。唯一可以理解的词是她的名字，\"Ellsee\"。",

	"From the pitch phase of each issue, ARCADIA aims to bring you innovative and actionable fifth edition content from top creators in RPGs. That doesn't just mean story and mechanics. The art in each issue, from the cover to each quarter-page diagram, is just as important to us as the words. Reading Makenzie De Armas's description of a noxa floods the mind with wonderful, alien imagery and possibilities. Without the time and words to describe every single visual detail of the creature, what you picture when you read is likely different than what I imagine. But when Makenzie's evocative description is placed alongside Grace Cheung's illustration of the new elemental, we get two incredible results.": "从每期的投稿阶段开始，ARCADIA旨在为你带来RPG游戏中顶级创作者的创新和可操作的第五版内容。这不仅仅是指故事和机制。每一期的艺术，从封面到每个四分之一页的图表，对我们来说和文字一样重要。阅读Makenzie De Armas对诺克萨斯的描述时，脑海中充斥着美妙的、陌生的想象和可能性。由于没有时间和文字来描述生物的每一个视觉细节，你在阅读时想象的东西很可能与我想象的不同。但是，当Makenzie令人回味的描述与Grace Cheung的新元素插图放在一起时，我们得到了两个不可思议的结果。",

	"While quantity is one driving factor for us, more important is quality. RPG art should do more than bring imaginations together. It should make your mind run wild. A good illustration of a monster shows the players what the creature looks like. A great illustration thrills them as they imagine not just what the monster is but what it can be and what it will do. The best RPG design gives you ideas for epic storytelling possibilities. It makes you contact your friends immediately to set up a time to game so you can use that content. Art is no different. The visuals in ARCADIA don't just show you something—they make you wonder what else could be. A lot of that is thanks to the amazing art team at MCDM.": "虽然数量是我们的一个驱动因素，但更重要的是质量。RPG艺术应该做的不仅仅是把想象力带到一起。它应该让你的思想狂奔。一幅好的怪物插图向玩家展示了这个生物的样子。一幅伟大的插图使他们兴奋不已，因为他们不仅想象出怪物是什么，而且想象出它能成为什么，它将做什么。最好的RPG设计为你提供了讲史诗故事的可能性的想法。它让你立即联系你的朋友，安排一个游戏时间，以便你能使用这些内容。艺术也不例外。ARCADIA中的视觉效果不只是向你展示了一些东西--它们让你想知道还有什么可以做。这在很大程度上要归功于MCDM的神奇艺术团队。",
	"I've learned more about art in the few months I've been working on ARCADIA than I did my entire life before. Executive Art Director Jason Hasenauer and Artist & Outsource Manager Nick De Spain (whose mounts you saw in issue 1) thoughtfully curate each piece. They look over the articles and art suggestions from the authors, myself, and Head of Production Anna Coulter, and select the artists who fit each job. Often that person is Grace Cheung, MCDM's beyond-talented In-House Artist. Other times it is the work of Marlowe Lune, as you'll see in \"Subclasses of the Seasons,\" Diana Muñoz, whose maps appear in \"Well of the Lost Gods,\" or any number of incredible folks we have collaborated with or will in future issues. When all the art is complete, Jen McCleary, one of the most creative graphic and layout designers I've ever worked with, brings it all together into an evocative magazine. I really hope you enjoy digging in as much as we did making it.": "在我为ARCADIA工作的几个月里，我学到的艺术知识比我之前的整个人生都要多。执行艺术总监Jason Hasenauer和艺术家兼外包经理Nick De Spain（你在第1期看到了他的画作）深思熟虑地策划了每一篇文章。他们审视来自作者、我和制作主管Anna Coulter的文章和艺术建议，并选择适合每个工作的艺术家。这个人往往是MCDM才华横溢的内部艺术家Grace Cheung。其他时候是马洛-卢恩（Marlowe Lune）的作品，正如你在《季节的次类》中看到的，戴安娜-穆尼奥斯（Diana Muñoz）的地图出现在《失落之神的井》中，或任何数量的令人难以置信的人，我们已经合作或将在未来的问题上合作。当所有的艺术作品完成后，詹-麦克利里，我曾经合作过的最有创意的图形和布局设计师之一，将所有的东西汇集成一本令人难忘的杂志。我真的希望你能像我们制作杂志一样享受其中的乐趣。",
	"The desolation of winter, the rebirth of spring, the relentlessness of summer, and the isolation of fall. Some practitioners of the arcane arts gain power from the natural patterns each season exhibits. Going beyond weather phenomena or base elements, these mages delve fully into the nature of the world as it is influenced by a season, taking power from the essence of each perennial force.": "冬天的荒凉，春天的重生，夏天的无情，以及秋天的孤立无援。一些奥术从业者从每个季节的自然模式中获得力量。超越天气现象或基本元素，这些法师完全深入研究世界的本质，因为它受到季节的影响，从每个常年力量的本质中获取力量。",
	"Such mages and their studies are uncommon, but nevertheless they are persistent. While their numbers may be few and their practitioners scattered, their ranks will always replenish, just as the seasons continue to turn. In this article you will find four subclasses, one each for the bard, sorcerer, wizard, and warlock, each themed after one of the four seasons.": "这样的法师和他们的研究并不常见，但尽管如此，他们仍然坚持不懈。虽然他们的数量可能很少，他们的从业者也很分散，但他们的队伍总是会得到补充，就像季节不断地转动一样。在本文中，你会发现四个子类，吟游诗人、巫师、魔法师和术士各占一个，每个都以四季中的一个为主题。",
	"Hexagonal glyphs flare around a mage's fingertips as she mutters words of arcane command to an unseen plane. Beneath her feet, searing fissures burst through the compact earth, and as she finishes her spell, something begins to rise from the bedrock. Something molten, jagged, hulking. Something elemental, barely holding its form together.": "一个法师的指尖上闪烁着六边形的石刻，她对着一个看不见的平面嘀咕着奥术命令的话语。在她的脚下，灼热的裂缝冲破了紧凑的土地，当她完成她的咒语时，一些东西开始从基岩中升起。一些熔化的、锯齿状的、巨大的东西。一些元素性的东西，勉强维持其形态。",
	"Something {@i wildly} unstable.": "东西{@i wildly}不稳定。",
	"Contrary to popular belief, air, fire, earth, and water are not the only elements in the universe. They just happen to be the most stable of the elementals, the easiest for individuals to summon and control through arcane means. But more reckless mages, through complex study, can conjure fearsome creatures made from other elements. Lithium, argon, magnesium—such elementals are extremely dangerous and rarely obedient to their summoner. But for those able to harness such creatures, the power these elementals wield is beyond even the keenest conjurer's imagination.": "与流行的看法相反，空气、火、土和水并不是宇宙中唯一的元素。它们只是碰巧是最稳定的元素，最容易被个人通过奥术手段召唤和控制。但更多鲁莽的法师，通过复杂的研究，可以用其他元素变出可怕的生物。锂、氩、镁......这些元素极其危险，而且很少服从于它们的召唤者。但对于那些能够驾驭这种生物的人来说，这些元素所拥有的力量甚至超出了最敏锐的魔法师的想象。",
	"This article presents four new elemental creatures that draw inspiration from the real-life periodic table. These new elementals provide fresh combat options for any adventurers tired of fighting the same elemental monsters again and again (not to mention the GMs tired of running them). Also included are alternate rules for encounters with different types of elementals that explore how elements may react with one another to create even more volatile chaos on the battlefield.": "本文介绍了四种新的元素生物，它们从现实生活中的元素周期表中汲取灵感。这些新的元素生物为任何厌倦了与同样的元素怪物反复战斗的冒险者提供了新的战斗选择（更不用说厌倦了管理它们的GM了）。此外，还包括与不同类型的元素相遇的替代规则，这些规则探讨了元素之间如何相互反应，从而在战场上创造出更加动荡的混乱局面。",
	"Whether running a game for a group of intrepid arcane researchers or a band of scrappy heroes trying to survive another day, these new elemental options help you combine science and magic to craft more dynamic elemental encounters in your campaign.": "不管是为一群无畏的奥术研究者，还是为一群试图再活一天的潦倒英雄做游戏，这些新的元素选项都能帮助你结合科学和魔法，在你的战役中制作更多动态的元素遭遇。",
	"Ophira Pyet was once a disgraced conjuration student living alone in an underground laboratory hidden away in the mountains. Surrounded by failed experiments and scribbled arcane equations her teachers vehemently insisted would never work, Ophira turned in desperation to the very earth she stood on. A few preliminary tests uncovered motes of unique elements hidden in the bedrock, and within a week, Ophira managed to pull massive quantities of these elements to the surface and bind them to planar spirits. She dubbed these creatures {@b nova elementals}: new, carefully refined elemental conjurations with specific and dangerous powers.": "奥菲拉-派特曾经是一个不光彩的魔法学生，独自生活在一个隐藏在山区的地下实验室里。周围都是失败的实验和潦草的奥术方程式，她的老师极力坚持说永远不会成功，奥菲拉在绝望中转向了她所站立的大地。一些初步的测试发现了隐藏在基岩中的独特元素的微尘，在一个星期内，奥菲拉成功地将大量的这些元素拉到表面，并将它们与平面精神结合起来。她给这些生物起了个名字叫\"%0%\"：新的、精心提炼的、具有特殊和危险力量的元素组合。",
	"A month later, Ophira revealed her discoveries in an explosive display during her university's commencement ceremony, to much surprise and amazement. Professors who previously shunned her now begged Ophira to teach them her methods of elemental conjuration. But no longer beholden to them as a student, Ophira refused. A few more persistent mages attempted to reverse engineer her process, but they soon realized that without Ophira's precise calculations at hand, these nova elementals would become wild and stubborn, disobeying commands and quickly turning against their summoners.": "一个月后，欧菲拉在她大学的毕业典礼上以爆炸性的方式展示了她的发现，让人感到惊讶和诧异。以前对她避之不及的教授们现在恳求欧菲拉教他们她的元素魔法方法。但作为学生，奥菲拉不再受他们的约束，她拒绝了。一些更顽固的法师试图对她的过程进行逆向工程，但他们很快意识到，如果没有奥菲拉的精确计算，这些新星元素会变得狂野而顽固，不服从命令，并很快与他们的召唤者反目。",
	"Ophira would go on to publish her findings about elemental magic, though her exact means of exerting perfect control over the nova elementals would always remain her closely guarded secret. Some elemental mages have figured out alternate means for semi-stabilizing summoned nova elementals, but the practice is generally regarded as a brazen and foolish use of magic.": "奥菲拉后来发表了她对元素魔法的研究结果，但她对新星元素完美控制的确切手段始终是她严守的秘密。一些元素法师已经想出了半稳定召唤新星元素的替代方法，但这种做法通常被认为是对魔法的无耻和愚蠢的使用。",
	"{@b {@i Product of Scientific Study.}} Though there are reports of nova elementals occurring naturally in the wild (usually at potent nexuses with a high concentration of a singular element, like a silver mine, or in places with powerful latent magic), most must be created by a mage. Such individuals conjure nova elementals to serve as guards, hunters, or assistants for future experiments. But more often than not, these mages lose control over their summoned creatures, and the nova elementals end up wreaking havoc on their surroundings.": "{@b {@i Product of Scientific Study.}}虽然有报告称新星元素会自然出现在野外（通常是在单一元素浓度较高的地方，如银矿，或在有强大潜在魔法的地方），但大多数必须由法师创造。这些人召唤出新星元素，作为守卫、猎手或未来实验的助手。但更多的时候，这些法师会失去对他们所召唤的生物的控制，而新星元素最终会对他们周围的环境造成严重破坏。",
	"{@b {@i Refined Power.}} The higher the concentration of a nova elemental's primary element, the more powerful it grows—and the more ornery its personality becomes. An elemental that is 100% pure explosive calcium is far nastier to encounter than one only half-comprised of the element.": "{@b {@i Refined Power.}}新星元素的主要元素的浓度越高，它的力量就越大--它的个性就越暴躁。一个100%纯度的爆炸性钙元素比一个只有一半成分的元素要难缠得多。",
	"{@b {@i Elemental Nature.}} Like its more stable cousins, a nova elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "{@b {@i Elemental Nature.}}和它更稳定的表亲一样，新星元素不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Also often referred to as \"lightning in a bottle,\" an elekron crackles with pure energy. Elekrons are most closely related to fire elementals, but unlike their flame-based cousins, elekrons have the incredible ability to consume raw energy from their environment and deal staggering amounts of damage.": "也经常被称为 \"瓶中闪电\"，Elekron闪烁着纯能量。埃里克龙与火元素关系最为密切，但与它们基于火焰的表亲不同，埃里克龙具有从环境中消耗原始能量并造成惊人伤害的惊人能力。",
	"Frequently, the elements are presented as diametric opposites of each other; water douses fire, and air's free-flowing nature contradicts earth's immovability. But this separation is merely an illusion. More often than not, the elements actually work together, moving in tandem to create the world around us. They feed off each other, strengthen each other, and in the most dangerous circumstances, fuel each other's rampant destruction.": "通常，这些元素被呈现为彼此的对立面；水浇灭了火，空气的自由流动与地球的不可移动性相矛盾。但这种分离只是一种幻觉。更多时候，这些元素实际上是一起工作的，串联起来创造我们周围的世界。它们相互喂养，相互加强，在最危险的情况下，相互助长猖獗的破坏。",
	"The following two sets of alternate rules aim to provide a way to simulate this natural teamwork in encounters with multiple elementals.": "以下两套备用规则旨在提供一种方法来模拟与多个元素相遇时的这种自然的团队合作。",
	"The simplest way to add elemental teamwork to your encounters is to consider environmental states. Elementals do extra damage depending on their target's current state. When this happens, roll an extra damage die when rolling the total damage for that elemental's attacks or abilities. You can find a list of example states in the table below, showing which elementals gain extra damage from each state.": "在你的遭遇战中加入元素团队合作的最简单方法是考虑环境状态。元素会根据其目标的当前状态而造成额外的伤害。当这种情况发生时，在滚动该元素的攻击或能力的总伤害时，要滚动一个额外的伤害模子。你可以在下面的表格中找到一个例子状态的列表，显示了每种状态下哪些元素会获得额外伤害。",
	"Metallic": "金属质地",
	"Holding a metal weapon; wearing metal armor": "拿着金属武器；穿着金属铠甲",
	"Fire elemental, elekron": "火元素, elekron",
	"Soaked": "浸泡",

	"Comburo, elekron": "Comburo, elekron",
	"Windswept": "风吹草动",
	"Being targeted by a noxa's Asphyxiation ability; standing in the same space as an air elemental": "被诺克萨斯的窒息能力锁定；与空气元素站在同一空间内",
	"With this option, using different elementals in a single encounter unlocks reactivities, which function like legendary actions.": "有了这个选项，在一次遭遇战中使用不同的元素就可以解锁反应性，其功能类似于传奇行动。",
	"During combat, elementals can use a certain number of reactivities outside their turns. Only one reactivity can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The elementals can forgo using them, and reactivities cannot be used if any of the elementals involved are more than 60 feet from one another, or if one or more of the elementals required are {@condition incapacitated} or otherwise unable to take actions. The elementals regain all spent reactivities on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties). The following three examples provide reactivity rules for some of the most effective elemental combinations. You can use them as templates to design reactivity options for your own encounters.": "在战斗中，元素体可以在他们的回合之外使用一定数量的反应性。每次只能使用一个反应能力，而且只能在另一个生物的回合结束时使用。元素们可以放弃使用它们，如果任何参与的元素之间的距离超过60英尺，或者如果一个或多个所需的元素是（%0%）或以其他方式无法采取行动，则不能使用反应能力。元素们在主动权计数20时重新获得所有花费的反应性（失去主动权的平局）。下面的三个例子提供了一些最有效的元素组合的反应性规则。你可以把它们作为模板，为你自己的遭遇战设计反应性选项。",
	"An encounter that uses reactivities is more dangerous than normal and increases the challenge rating of each elemental in the battle by 1.": "使用反应性的遭遇战比正常情况下更危险，并使战斗中每个元素的挑战等级增加1。",
	"The whirling wind of an air elemental fuels the flames of a fire elemental, causing them to burn even brighter. This team of elementals can take 3 reactivities, choosing from the options below.": "空气元素的旋风助长了火元素的火焰，使其燃烧得更加旺盛。这支元素队伍可以采取3种反应方式，从下面的选项中选择。",
	"{@b {@i Hot Air.}} Each creature within 30 feet of the air elemental that is not one of the reactive elementals must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as the air rises in temperature to a shimmering, sweltering heat. A creature takes 12 ({@damage 4d4 + 2}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "{@b {@i Hot Air.}}在空气元素30英尺范围内的每个生物，如果不是反应型元素，都必须做一个DC13宪法救赎，因为空气的温度上升到一个闪闪发光的闷热。拯救失败时，生物会受到12({@damage 4d4 + 2})的火焰伤害，拯救成功时则会受到一半的伤害。",
	"{@b {@i Ash Cloud.}} Each creature within 30 feet of the fire elemental that is not one of the reactive elementals must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as blustering winds swirl with ash. A creature who fails this saving throw is {@condition blinded} until it uses its action to clear its eyes.": "{@b {@i Ash Cloud.}}在火元素30英尺范围内的每个生物，如果不属于反应型元素的话，就必须做一个DC13宪法规定的蓄力动作，就像蓝风卷着灰一样。失败的生物在使用行动清除其眼睛之前，会受到（%1%）的伤害。",

Each creature within 10 feet of that point that is not one of the reactive elementals must immediately make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 15 ({@damage 3d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) fire damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked {@condition prone}.": "{@b {@i Fire Whirls (Costs 2 Reactivities).}}一个可怕的火龙卷在空气元素和火元素都能看到的地方爆发。在该点10英尺范围内的每个生物，如果不是被动元素之一，必须立即做一个DC13力量救赎的动作。如果失败，生物会受到15({@damage 3d8 + 2})的重击伤害加上10({@damage 2d6 + 3})的火焰伤害并被击倒{@condition prone}。成功时，生物会受到一半的伤害，并且不会被击倒（%4%）。",
	"Water is often seen as the antithesis of fire—but for the volatile comburo, water is a gift. The waves of a water elemental only serve to heighten the explosive sparks that the unstable comburo generates. This team of elementals can take 3 reactivities, choosing from the options below.": "水通常被看作是火的对立面，但对于不稳定的组合体来说，水是一种礼物。水元素的波浪只会让不稳定的燃烧室产生的爆炸性火花更加强烈。这队元素可以采取3种反应性，从下面的选项中选择。",

	"{@b {@i Fulmination (Costs 2 Reactivities).}} A massive explosion of searing water, fire, and sparks erupts at a point that both the comburo and the water elemental can see. Each creature within 15 feet of that point that is not one of the reactive elementals must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "{@b {@i Fulmination (Costs 2 Reactivities).}} 灼热的水、火和火花的巨大爆炸，在组合体和水元素都能看到的地方爆发出来。在该点15英尺范围内的每个生物，如果不是被动元素之一，就必须做一个DC 15的灵巧救赎，救赎失败会受到13({@damage 2d8 + 4})的重击伤害加上14({@damage 4d6})的火伤害加上9({@damage 2d8})的雷电伤害，救赎成功则会受到一半的伤害。",
