	"Crafting has long been a major focus of the game, and something countless players have sought to engage with since the early days; after all, what adventurer wouldn't want to be better outfitted, better equipped and more prepared... and what adventurer wouldn't want the chance to put their personal mark on their gear?": "长久以来，手工制作一直是游戏的主要焦点，也是无数玩家从早期就开始寻求参与的事情；毕竟，哪个冒险家不希望有更好的装备、更好的装备和更多的准备......哪个冒险家不希望有机会在他们的装备上打上自己的个人标记？",
	"The core principle of this crafting system is simplicity and specificity. Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules, but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything. While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It's a complete package that provides all the necessarily details for your players to get started—and plenty of tables and guides for GMs as well.": "这个工艺系统的核心原则是简单和具体。每件事都有简单易行的规则，但又有足够的深度，以解除GM必须为每件事提供具体细节来填补每一个空白的负担。虽然管理员总是什么存在的仲裁者，以及一个工艺配方是否有效，但总的来说，这个系统可以根据管理员想要增加的投入来运行，或多或少。这是一个完整的软件包，为你的玩家提供了所有必要的细节，使他们能够开始工作--同时也为GM提供了大量的表格和指南。",
	"Some people may wonder: why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.": "有些人可能会问：你为什么需要一个手工制作系统？这不就是战利品的作用吗？事实是，在某些游戏中，这是真的。不是每个冒险者都想追求手工制作。但是有了制作系统，你不仅可以制作你需要的东西而不需要在龙囤里找到它，你在龙囤里找到的东西还可以更多。",
	"In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there are just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafter's creativity.": "在一个拥有强大的手工制作系统的游戏中，没有垃圾，只有更多的机会和新鲜的可能性。一把没人能用的+1短剑可以成为新长矛的宝贵基础。宝石、黄金、遗物和可回收物......都是手工业者创造力的有效切入点。",
	"Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.": "冒险家是天生的创新者，为困难的问题寻求创造性的解决方案。手工制作给了他们这样的工具箱。",
	"So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it.": "那么......为什么你需要手工制作？你不需要。但你也许应该想要它。",
	"Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Inventor); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.": "任何一个人都可以! 谁都能成功地做出有用的东西？也许有点不同的说法。手工制作在本质上与等级无关，尽管在某些情况下，一些等级可能会给它带来好处（如发明家）；手工制作可能来自你的背景，以工具熟练度的形式出现，或者它可能是你在冒险过程中学习到的东西，遵循必要性是发明之母的古老谚语。",
	"Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your GM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.": "手工制作主要是指时间、努力、知识和材料。因此，大部分手工制作都是知道配方并拥有所需的时间和材料......但是一个熟练的工匠工作得更快，也更成功，在这个行业里，实践出真知，所以有各种进步的修改因素。你的GM可以决定你的背景是否值得以任何方式开始你的冒险，否则就包括如何获得它们的指南。",
	"Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields—from alchemy to engineering to woodworking.": "什么都可以! 但本指南是由一个凡人制作的，因此范围有限。本指南将提供许多领域的工艺原理--从炼金术到工程到木工。",
	"The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.": "每个领域之间的手工制作的基础是相似的，但配方、材料和最重要的结果会有根本性的不同...... 毕竟，治疗药水、弹射器和魔法剑都是你可以制作的东西，但每个人的过程都有很大的不同。",
	"The goal of this document is to teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something that doesn't appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your game world!": "本文件的目的是教你如何开始，并提供基础知识，让你在冒险中走得更远，但不是把所有有可能制作的东西都编成完整的法典。当你遇到本文件中没有出现的东西时，只需参考最接近的项目，并对实现你的游戏世界的愿景可能需要的额外步骤进行一下跳跃",
	"One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player-driven system.": "手工制作系统的基本目标和灵感之一是使其成为一个由玩家驱动的系统。",
	"It is a system where the player can say \"I would like to harvest the monster for ingredients\" and \"I would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents\" and ultimately \"I would like to make a healing potion\" and all those rules can be exposed to the player allowing them to directly browse and consider what they want to make, as well as how to make it.": "这是一个系统，玩家可以说 \"我想收获怪物的成分\"，\"我想在我们穿过森林寻找炼金术试剂时进行觅食\"，最终 \"我想制作治疗药水\"，所有这些规则都可以暴露给玩家，让他们直接浏览和考虑他们想要制作的东西，以及如何制作它。",
	"The GM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the GM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.": "GM仍然对其中的许多实例进行裁决，但理想的情况是有一个系统，GM不必对每一个收集材料和制作的实例进行手工制作。",
	"While the system is meant to enable player-driven choice, always remember to work with your GM. Check in with them when selecting an item you would like to make and confirm that item exists in their world, and any assumptions hold true.": "虽然这个系统是为了实现玩家驱动的选择，但始终记得要与你的GM合作。在选择你想制作的物品时，要向他们确认该物品在他们的世界中存在，并且任何假设都是真实的。",
	"Some GMs may rule that some items have higher rarity or are simply not available at their default assigned rarity. A common example of this may be something like Winged Boots, which are only rated as Uncommon, but some GMs may feel they are a better fit for rare and adjust their difficulty accordingly.": "一些GM可能会规定某些物品具有更高的稀有性，或者根本无法获得其默认分配的稀有性。一个常见的例子是像翼之靴这样的东西，它只被评为不常见，但一些GM可能觉得它们更适合稀有，并相应地调整其难度。",
	"On the other hand, if the GM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.": "另一方面，如果GM想让玩家参与其中，他们可以使用一些工具。到目前为止，最有效的工具是把试剂作为战利品的一部分送给玩家，这些试剂没有明显的卖点。如果你给玩家2个治疗试剂，他们就会开始研究如何使用这些试剂，因为他们更愿意拥有一个治疗药水。",
	"If you want to go one further though, if you give them 5 curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into \"Well, how do we get a 6th!\"": "如果你想更进一步，如果你给他们5个治疗性试剂，他们意识到他们会有一个剩余的......然后他们开始研究 \"那么，我们如何获得第六个！\"",
	"This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward.": "这个系统有两个目标：简单和易于使用，以及深入和可扩展。自然，这两者有些矛盾，并通过大量的可选深度来完成。为了生产具有标准效果的标准物品，寻找或购买材料并使用它们来制作你想制作的东西的过程将是直接的。",
	"How much of the detail you want to engage with as a GM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold-based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients there is information in the appendix you can draw from for that.": "作为一个GM，你想参与多少细节，可以通过你发放试剂的方式轻松调整。通过坚持使用标准成分并使用它们的通用名称，这些材料并不比发放金币或其他奖励复杂（如果你想要最简化的版本，甚至可以轻松地完全转换为基于金币的系统），但如果你想拥有特定的成分名称和异国成分，你可以在附录中借鉴这方面的信息。",
	"Crafting under this system is very simple. You collect the ingredients for a particular thing you want to make, and use your skills with tools to make it into that item. The crafting time of this system is very compressed compared to the systems you might find in the base options because this system is not intended to use downtime to gate crafting.": "在这个系统下，手工制作是非常简单的。你收集你想制作的特定物品的原料，然后使用你的技能和工具将其制作成该物品。与你可能在基础选项中发现的系统相比，这个系统的制作时间是非常压缩的，因为这个系统的目的不是利用停机时间来进行制作。",
	"Rather, this is built to work with an adventuring lifestyle. You might need a little time here and there, but it will be measured in hours rather than days and weeks. Consequently, the gates to crafted items are instead the materials and skill required rather than time and gold, though you can certainly use gold to buy those materials in some cases.": "相反，这是为了配合冒险的生活方式而建造的。你可能在这里和那里需要一点时间，但它将以小时为单位，而不是几天和几周。因此，制作物品的门槛是所需的材料和技能，而不是时间和金币，尽管在某些情况下你当然可以用金币来购买这些材料。",
	"Following there is a quick summary, as well as more indepth break down of crafting time and checks, materials and where to find them, and finally the specifics of each branch.": "下面是一个快速的总结，以及更深入的制作时间和检查、材料和在哪里找到它们，最后是每个分支的具体细节。",
	"Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like \"common curative reagent\" rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a \"common poisonous reagent\" and used as such in crafting.": "在上面和整个文件中，你会看到原料是以 \"普通治疗试剂 \"这样的通用标签来称呼的，而不是具体的性质。例如，你可能收获了神奇的草药，并在森林中发现了Kingsbane，一种有毒的植物。出于制作的目的，这可以简单地记录为 \"普通有毒试剂\"，并在制作中如此使用。",
	"This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.": "这大大简化了制作和记录你的用品的过程。从叙事上讲，一个熟练的炼金术士可以把他们想用的原料以他们需要的形式渲染下来。",
	"Each crafting profession will have some profession-wide materials that are used in their recipes: reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc.": "每个手工艺职业都会有一些全职业的材料，在他们的配方中使用：炼金术的试剂，铁匠的金属，等等。",
	"Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though it is up to your GM.": "一些非常稀有和传奇的物品会有特定的成分；这是为了调味而不是平衡，不过这取决于你的GM。",
	"Each step will be outlined in more depth, but the following serves as a summary and reference for the process.": "每个步骤都会有更深入的概述，但以下内容可作为这一过程的总结和参考。",
	"{@b Select an Item.} Find the item you would like to craft on a crafting table.": "{@b Select an Item.} 在工艺台上找到你想制作的物品。",
	"{@b Check with your GM.} They will confirm if that item exists and has the default rarity in their game. This system is a tool, it does not supersede worldbuilding.": "{@b Check with your GM.} 他们将确认该物品是否存在，并且在他们的游戏中具有默认的稀有性。这个系统是一个工具，它并不取代世界建设。",
	"{@b Gather the materials.} Materials can be looted from humanoids, harvested from more exotic creature types, purchased at stores, or gathered from the wilderness. The specifics of any material and where it can be found is covered in the materials section.": "{@b Gather the materials.} 材料可以从人类身上掠夺，从更多的外来生物类型中收获，在商店购买，或从荒野中收集。任何材料的具体细节以及在哪里可以找到，在材料部分都有介绍。",
	"{@b Begin crafting!} You can find the related tool and ability score on the table below. Use the related tool and skill to determine your crafting modifier using the following formula:": "{@b Begin crafting!} 你可以在下表中找到相关的工具和能力得分。使用相关的工具和技能，用以下公式确定你的工艺修改器。",
	"You can make progress in 2 hour increments. For each 2 hours spent, make a crafting roll using the formula above and compare the result to the DC listed for the item": "你可以以2小时为单位取得进展。每花2个小时，用上面的公式做一个制作卷，并将结果与该项目所列的DC进行比较。",
	"On failure, no progress is made. If you fail three times in a row, the crafting fails and all materials are lost.": "一旦失败，就不会有任何进展。如果你连续失败三次，制作就会失败，所有材料都会丢失。",
	"On success, 2 hours of progress is made, and you can mark your progress put it aside or continue to craft.": "一旦成功，就会有2小时的进展，你可以标记你的进展把它放在一边或继续制作。",
	"Once your completed progress on an item is equal to the crafting time listed, the item is complete.": "一旦你在某一项目上完成的进度与所列的制作时间相等，该项目就完成了。",
	"{@b You're done!} Enjoy your shiny new item!": "{@b You're done!} 享受你闪亮的新物品吧!",
	"You can \"take 10\" on a crafting recipe by doubling the crafting time.": "你可以通过加倍制作时间来 \"拿下 \"一个制作配方。",
	"The final say on any item is up to your GM. If they disagree with the written recipe, they are correct!": "任何项目的最终决定权都是由你的GM决定的。如果他们不同意书面配方，那么他们就是正确的!",
	"Don't be afraid to ask where you can find materials—the GM wants you to engage with the world and find things!": "不要害怕问你在哪里可以找到材料--总经理希望你与这个世界打交道并找到东西!",
	"A crafting roll is a special kind of check. You can't apply boosts other than expertise to your crafting check. In general, the only way other than expertise to boost a crafting roll is to get help from another skilled crafted for the entire duration of the craft. Remember you can use the take 10 option to get slower more certain success, and if a craft has a higher DC than you can achieve using that method, it likely should involve some degree of difficulty and risk.": "手工制作卷是一种特殊的检查。你不能对你的工艺检查应用除专业知识以外的提升。一般来说，除了专业知识之外，唯一能提高制作卷的方法是在制作的整个过程中得到另一个熟练的制作者的帮助。记住你可以使用取10的选项来获得更慢的确定的成功，如果一项工艺的DC比你使用该方法所能达到的更高，它很可能应该涉及一定程度的难度和风险。",

	"You can gain can advantage if another player with proficiency in the related tool helps for the whole crafting time.": "如果另一个精通相关工具的玩家在整个制作过程中提供帮助，你可以获得优势。",
	"When you craft something, double the crafting period (from 2 hours to 4 hours per check) to \"take a 10\" on the crafting roll, meaning that your crafting checks are 10 + your related ability score + your related tool proficiency bonus. This provides a floor level that you can always succeed on if you choose to take your time.": "当你制作某样东西时，将制作时间翻倍（每次检查从2小时到4小时），在制作卷上 \"取10\"，这意味着你的制作检查是10+你的相关能力得分+你的相关工具熟练度奖励。这提供了一个底线，如果你选择慢慢来，你总是可以成功。",
	"If someone with proficiency is aiding you for the entire duration of the crafting, the crafting check doesn't gain any bonus, but can be completed in the standard 2 hours.": "如果在整个制作过程中，有精通的人在协助你，制作检查不会获得任何奖励，但可以在标准的2小时内完成。",
	"It should always be assumed that when NPCs are crafting, they take this option, and thus craft more slowly but reliably. The slap-dash speed crafting is largely the domain of the players, though at the GM's discretion the players may convince a NPC to craft faster assuming the risk of their materials.": "应该总是假设，当NPC在制作时，他们会选择这个选项，从而制作得更慢但更可靠。蜻蜓点水式的快速制作在很大程度上是玩家的领域，尽管在GM的决定下，玩家可以说服NPC在承担材料风险的情况下快速制作。",
	"When a character is spending all day working, they make 8 hours of progress, and cannot exceed 8 hours working on a crafting project during a day. Players will occasionally want to work longer than 8 hours, but this fails to account for the limitations of mortals: player characters still need to eat, sleep, and will eventually lose their focus and ability to work. This is primarily implemented for balance reasons, but also helps model how much productive time a character can spend; they are not just working 8 hours straight and idling for 8 hours, but rather a model of the natural flow of a day, taking breaks, etc.": "当一个角色整天都在工作时，他们会取得8小时的进展，在一天内不能超过8小时的工艺项目工作。玩家偶尔会希望工作时间超过8小时，但这没有考虑到凡人的局限性：玩家角色仍然需要吃饭、睡觉，并且最终会失去他们的注意力和工作能力。这主要是为了平衡的原因而实施的，但也有助于模拟一个角色可以花多少生产时间；他们不是连续工作8小时和闲置8小时，而是一天的自然流程的模型，休息等。",
	"A GM can choose to overrule this and allow extreme crafting days in special circumstances, but in almost all cases working over 8 hours on a crafting project would leave a character with one or more levels of Exhaustion.": "GM可以选择推翻这一点，允许在特殊情况下进行极端的手工制作，但是在几乎所有的情况下，在一个手工制作项目上工作超过8小时会让一个角色有一个或多个级别的疲惫感。",
	"Without materials, there is nothing to craft from. Crafting does not make things from thin air, it makes more useful things from less useful things. Gathering the materials will be the essential first step in any job. Materials are generally found in three ways.": "没有材料，就没有东西可以制作。手工艺不是凭空制造东西，而是从不太有用的东西中制造更多有用的东西。收集材料将是任何工作中必不可少的第一步。材料一般通过三种方式找到。",
	"Nothing is useless when you have a party of crafters. One of the main sources of materials will be the things you find. Nothing is useless when you have an expert craftsman in the party.": "当你有一个手工艺人的聚会时，没有什么是无用的。材料的主要来源之一将是你找到的东西。当你有一个工匠专家在党内时，没有什么是无用的。",
	"How something is gathered varies on the profession; in many cases, it can only be gathered when the opportunity arises. Dragon scales, for example, are a lot easier to gather when there is a dead dragon nearby. Be it harvesting rare herbs, monster parts, or minerals, gathering is an opportunity you won't want to pass up.": "如何收集的东西因职业而异；在许多情况下，只有在机会出现时才能收集。例如，当附近有一条死龙时，收集龙鳞就容易得多。无论是收获稀有草药、怪物零件还是矿物，采集都是一个你不想错过的机会。",
	"Rarely will everything you need to craft what you want fall into you hands without the assistance of the oldest and most powerful tool of any craftsman: money. When you don't have what you need, frequently you can buy it. For some professions, there will be a lot more materials that can be purchased, while others will rely more on the other routes.": "如果没有任何工匠最古老和最强大的工具的帮助，你所需要的一切都会落入你的手中：金钱。当你没有你需要的东西时，你经常可以买到它。对于某些职业来说，可以购买的材料会多很多，而其他职业则更多地依赖其他途径。",
	"In general, the buying price of a material is its listed value, and its selling price is usually half of that to an interested property.": "一般来说，材料的购买价格是它的上市价值，而它的销售价格通常是对感兴趣的财产的一半。",
	"Between negotiation, market fluctuation, and GM moods, you may get better or worse prices. Note that many materials are simply junk to a party that does not have a use for them, and will only sell to interested parties that can use or resell them.": "在谈判、市场波动和总经理的情绪之间，你可能得到更好或更差的价格。请注意，许多材料对没有用处的一方来说简直是垃圾，只卖给能使用或转卖的感兴趣的一方。",
	"Threatening to burn down a merchant's shop because they will not offer you the listed price may result in an Intimidation check, but does not change market realities and is typically not beneficial to your reputation; most merchants that have the gold to buy and sell expensive materials have dealt with adventurers before and are not easily intimidate": "威胁烧毁商人的商店，因为他们不给你列出的价格，可能会导致恐吓检查，但不会改变市场现实，而且通常对你的声誉没有好处；大多数有黄金购买和销售昂贵材料的商人以前都和冒险家打过交道，不容易被恐吓。",
	"The sources of materials are tied to the pillars of the game. Looting and Harvesting are tied into the combat pillar, Salvaging and Gathering are tied into the exploration pillar, and purchasing and rewards are tied into the social pillar. This provides a lot of routes to add these materials to your game based on what works best for your group.": "材料的来源与游戏的支柱相联系。掠夺和收获与战斗支柱相关，打捞和采集与探索支柱相关，而购买和奖励则与社交支柱相关。这提供了很多路线，可以根据对你的团队最有效的方法将这些材料添加到你的游戏中。",
	"Reagents are a huge range of things; most often they are plants that contain some magical essence, but almost as frequently they are harvested from various magically inclined monsters. The exact source of a reagent usually does not matter beyond defining its type, as the part of the reagent used is the fragment of magic contained within that is distilled out.": "试剂的范围很广；最常见的是含有一些魔法精华的植物，但几乎同样频繁的是，它们是从各种有魔法倾向的怪物身上收获的。试剂的确切来源除了定义它的类型外，通常并不重要，因为试剂使用的部分是其中包含的魔法碎片，被提炼出来。",
	"There are many different ways to make a potion. Consequently, the materials are sorted into categories. These categories include curative, reactive, and poisonous. These each come in the standard material rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.": "有许多不同的方法来制作药水。因此，材料被分成了几类。这些类别包括治疗性、反应性和毒性。这些材料都有标准的稀有度：普通、不普通、稀有、非常稀有和传奇。",
	"Reagents can't be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).": "试剂一旦被组合成另一种形式（如药水、精华或墨水），就不能被挽救。",
	"Reagants can be assumed to weigh 0.2 pounds each.": "试剂可假定为每件重量为0.2磅。",
	"All curative, reactive, and poisonous ingredients are interchangeable. This is intentional to drastically simplify the crafting process and tracking thereof. Individual names are included only to deepen the immersion of the finding and buying ingredients, and can be treated as interchangeable by their label if preferred.": "所有治疗性、反应性和毒性成分都是可以互换的。这是有意为之的，目的是大幅简化制作过程和跟踪。包括个别名称只是为了加深寻找和购买成分的沉浸感，如果愿意的话，可以通过其标签将其视为可互换的。",
	"While ink has many uses, crafting is mostly concerned with magical ink which has the power to hold the arcane words of scrolls. This is synthesized by alchemists from the magical properties of reagents, as it is concerned with extracting their magical properties, the exact nature of the reagents used do not effect the final ink beyond its potency.": "虽然墨水有很多用途，但制作时主要关注的是魔法墨水，它有能力容纳卷轴上的神秘文字。这是由炼金术士从试剂的魔法属性中合成的，因为它关注的是提取它们的魔法属性，所使用的试剂的确切性质并不影响最终墨水的效力。",
	"Magical ink is not typically found or harvested on its own, though it may be found as loot, and in some instances a GM could rule that some blood collected from a fiend, celestial or dragon could be counted as such. It is generally created from reagents or purchased from alchemists that create it from reagents.": "魔法墨水通常不是自己发现或收获的，尽管它可以作为战利品被发现，在某些情况下，GM可以规定从恶魔、天人或龙身上收集的一些血液可以算作魔法墨水。它通常是用试剂制造的，或者从用试剂制造它的炼金术士那里购买。",
	"Magical ink can't be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink). Magical Ink can be assumed to wight 0.1 pounds each.": "魔法墨水一旦被组合成另一种形式（如药水、精华或墨水），就不能再被回收。魔法墨水可以被认为是每个重量为0.1磅的。",
	"While reagents are substances that contain a glimmer of magical power that can be harnessed through refinement, Essences are more purified forms of magical power. These come in three types: Arcane, Divine and Primal as well as in the five normal rarities (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary). These essences are the pure stuff of magic that makes things work.": "试剂是含有一丝魔力的物质，可以通过提炼加以利用，而精华则是更纯化的魔力形式。它们有三种类型。奥术的、神圣的和原始的，以及五种正常的稀有度（普通的、不常见的、稀有的、非常稀有的和传奇的）。这些精华是使事物运转的纯粹的魔法材料。",
	"You can get these by rendering down magical reagents, salvaging magic items, harvesting them from magical monsters, or through the hard work of spell casters. Or you can find them as loot from people that have already done one of those harder steps. The rules for rendering them down from materials are contained within each branch of crafting, while the rules for creating them yourself are under Enchanting, as it is their domain and skill set needed to do so.": "你可以通过渲染魔法试剂、打捞魔法物品、从魔法怪物身上收获它们，或者通过施法者的努力工作来获得这些东西。或者你可以从已经完成这些困难步骤之一的人那里找到它们作为战利品。从材料中提炼它们的规则包含在每个工艺分支中，而自己创造它们的规则则属于魔法师，因为这是他们的领域和所需的技能组合。",
	"While all branches occasionally use essences when extra magical power is needed, they are the primary material of Enchanters, and their pricing can be found in that section.": "虽然所有分支在需要额外魔力时偶尔会使用精华，但它们是魔法师的主要材料，其价格可在该部分找到。",
	"Essences can be found as loot during the courses of your adventures, but can also be harvested (from monsters), salvaged (from magical equipment), synthesized (from reagents), or created from the raw power of a spell caster, though the method is long and arduous.": "精华可以在你的冒险过程中作为战利品找到，但也可以收获（从怪物身上）、打捞（从魔法装备上）、合成（从试剂上）或从施法者的原始力量中创造出来，尽管这个方法是漫长而艰巨的。",
	"Essences are flexible in their exact nature. There are many paths to each desired outcome, and this flexibility is represented in Essences. While the traditional way to make a belt of hill giant strength may call for a hill giant heart as its essence, an enchanter may substitute a dragon heart as their primal essences to make a belt of dragon strength that just has the same statistical effect.": "本质在其确切的性质上是灵活的。通往每个期望结果的道路有很多，这种灵活性在精华中得到了体现。虽然制作山地巨人力量腰带的传统方法可能需要用山地巨人的心脏作为其精华，但魔法师可以用龙心作为其原始精华来制作一条龙的力量腰带，这也具有同样的统计效果。",
	"Essences can be assumed to weigh 1 pound each.": "精华液可以被认为是每个人都有1磅重。",
	"You also may be able to salvage magical essence from unwanted or broken magical items, though such a reclamation process can be difficult, and rarely results in more than a fraction of the essence infused into the original item. An item returns one essence equal to its rarity when harvested. The process takes 2 hours to complete, and doesn't work if the item is currently attuned to any creature. An essence can only be salvaged from permanent magic items; a permanent magic item is one that recharges or doesn't have a limitation on its charges or uses. A magic item with charges or uses can only be salvaged while it is at full charges or uses.": "你也可以从不需要的或破损的魔法物品中回收魔法精华，不过这样的回收过程可能很困难，而且很少会有超过一小部分的精华被注入原物品中。一个物品在收获后会返回与其稀有度相当的精华。这个过程需要2个小时才能完成，而且如果该物品目前与任何生物相吻合，则不会发挥作用。精华只能从永久的魔法物品中获取；永久的魔法物品是指可以充电或对其充电或使用没有限制的物品。有充能或使用权的魔法物品只能在充能或使用权已满的情况下被抢救。",
	"The item becomes nonmagical after the essence is salvaged from it. If it required magic to function or exist, it is destroyed.": "物品的精华被打捞出来后就变成了非魔法物品。如果它需要魔法来运作或存在，它就会被摧毁。",
	"In addition to harvesting essences from magical monsters fully intact, a more approachable and incremental way is to combine several reagents to get an essence. You have to combine three reagents of the same rarity to gain one essence of that rarity. You can combine reagents in the following ways:": "除了从魔法怪物身上完全收获精华外，一个更容易接近和递增的方法是结合几种试剂来获得精华。你必须结合三种相同稀有度的试剂才能获得一种该稀有度的精华。你可以通过以下方式组合试剂。",
	"Arcane": "玄学",
	"1 curative, 1 poisonous, 1 reactive": "1种治疗性，1种毒性，1种反应性",
	"Primal": "朴素的",
	"3 reactive": "3 反应",
	"Divine": "神圣的",
	"2 curative, 1 reactive": "2个治疗性，1个反应性",
	"Another potential source of an Essence is being created by a spellcaster. This process is long and arduous, and typically only suited to downtime. A creature with the spell casting feature can create 1 essence during 1 workweek (5 days, 8 hours a day); this process can't be completed faster and for the duration they are considered to have spent all of their spell slots.": "精华的另一个潜在来源是由施法者创造。这个过程是漫长而艰辛的，通常只适合于停工期。一个具有施法特征的生物可以在1个工作周（5天，每天8小时）内创造1个精华；这个过程不能更快完成，在这段时间内，他们被认为已经用完了所有的法术槽。",
	"At 1st level or higher can make a common essence in this way, a caster 5th level or higher can make an uncommon essence this way, a caster at 11th level can make a rare essence in this way, and a caster at 17th level or higher can make a very rare essence this way. Legendary essences require special rituals, more casters, and take far longer; they are exceedingly hard to make.": "一级或以上的施法者可以用这种方法制作普通的精华，五级或以上的施法者可以用这种方法制作不普通的精华，十一级的施法者可以用这种方法制作稀有的精华，十七级或以上的施法者可以用这种方法制作非常稀有的精华。传说中的精华需要特殊的仪式，需要更多的施法者，并且需要更长的时间；它们是非常难制造的。",

	"Ingots are chunks of metal that can be used to craft things. They are assumed to be relatively pure and weigh 2 pounds each. The default ingot listed in all the crafting tables is an ingot of Steel. These cost 2 gp per ingot. There are cheaper metals (such as Iron); pure Iron can't be used to craft weapons and armor, but can be used for other items, resulting in a cheaper item. On the other end of the spectrum, more advanced metals such as Mithral and Adamantine can be used conferring special properties, but being far more difficult to work with and costing more.": "钢锭是大块的金属，可以用来制作东西。它们被认为是相对纯净的，每个重量为2磅。所有工艺表中列出的默认钢锭是钢锭。每个钢锭的成本为2戈比。还有更便宜的金属（如铁）；纯铁不能用来制作武器和盔甲，但可以用来制作其他物品，从而使物品更便宜。在光谱的另一端，更高级的金属，如Mithral和Adamantine，可以被用来赋予特殊的属性，但更难加工，成本更高。",
	"Ingots can be assumed to weight 2 pounds each.": "锭子的重量可以假设为每个2磅。",
	"Metal items can be converted back to ingots quite efficiently, but require a forge to do so. With a forge and 2 hours per item, a metal item can be rendered down into its component ingots. Advanced metals may require special tools to smelt.": "金属物品可以相当有效地转化为钢锭，但需要一个锻炉来完成。有了锻炉，每件物品需要2个小时，一件金属物品可以被分解成其组成部分的钢锭。高级金属可能需要特殊的工具来熔炼。",
	"Creating ingots from raw ore is largely out of scope for most adventurers, but you can create ingots from raw ore with a suitable facility. For more details see the Components and Materials table under Blacksmithing.": "对于大多数冒险者来说，用原矿制造钢锭在很大程度上是不可能的，但是你可以用合适的设施用原矿制造钢锭。更多细节请参见铁匠铺下的部件和材料表。",
	"Hides, scales, and carapaces all tend to be harvested from monsters. Leather is a product of hides that can be processed from what it is harvested from the monster.": "兽皮、鳞片和甲壳都倾向于从怪物身上收获。皮革是皮革的一种产品，可以从怪物身上收获的东西进行加工。",
	"The GM determines if a monster provides hide, scale, or carapace. Hides do not come in different sizes, rather larger creatures simply provide more hides, and monsters that are not large enough to produce one hide provide only hide scraps.": "GM决定一个怪物是提供兽皮、鳞片还是甲壳。兽皮没有大小之分，较大的生物只是提供更多的兽皮，而不足以生产一张兽皮的怪物则只提供兽皮碎片。",
	"Scales are likewise abstracted: each increment is simply an arbitrary unit of scales that the unit of scales covers. Scales can be much larger or small from different-sized creatures.": "鳞片同样是抽象的：每个增量只是鳞片单位所涵盖的一个任意单位的鳞片。从不同大小的生物来看，鳞片可以大得多，也可以小得多。",
	"The system does not attempt to say how many scales a creature provides or how many literal actual scales makes up scalemail, but rather provides a number that is then consistently used.": "该系统并不试图说一个生物提供多少鳞片或多少字面的实际鳞片组成鳞片邮件，而是提供一个数字，然后统一使用。",
	"Creatures are harvested using a Survival check, with its DC listed below.

	"The process of turning hide into leather takes quite awhile (as per the crafting table), and is often something adventurers can delegate to NPCs (delivering hides to be processed) or do during downtime. If you would like a more expedited system, there is no balance reason for this, and you can short the leather crafting process to taking 2 hours, it just won't be exceedingly realistic.": "将兽皮变成皮革的过程需要相当长的时间（根据工艺表），而且通常是冒险者可以委托NPC（运送要加工的兽皮）或在停工期间进行的。如果你想要一个更快速的系统，这没有平衡的理由，你可以把皮革制作过程缩短到2小时，只是不会太现实。",
	"The term \"parts\" is used to refer to gears, wires, springs, windy bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either found or salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even straight from ingots by a Blacksmith for those that really want to be industrial about it). The exact nature of each item making up this collection is left abstracted.": "术语 \"零件 \"指的是齿轮、电线、弹簧、发条、螺丝、钉子和一些小玩意。零件可以是找到的，也可以是打捞上来的，或者是从金属废料中锻造出来的（甚至可以由铁匠直接从钢锭中提取，供那些真正想做工业的人使用）。组成这个系列的每个项目的确切性质是抽象的。",
	"In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged material that generally fall into the category of things \"too small to track\" which can then be used for the creations of tinkerers. In addition to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use ingots... particularly ones of tin (which is their namesake, after all).": "此外，金属废料是残余材料的集合，通常属于 \"太小而无法追踪 \"的东西，然后可以用于工匠的创作。除此以外，工匠们偶尔也会使用金属锭......特别是锡锭（毕竟这是他们的名字）。",
	"Like other crafting branches, there are also named components for more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a crossbow, for example, or other items. The cost for these items can be found on the common component table, and are generally minor.": "像其他工艺分支一样，也有为更多的标志性装备命名的部件--例如，弩箭的支架，或其他物品。这些物品的成本可以在普通组件表中找到，而且一般都是小的。",
	"Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things that push beyond the mundane principles of plausibility, crafting magical properties into their inventions.": "最后，工匠们在建造超越世俗的合理性原则的东西时，会使用精华，在他们的发明中制作出神奇的属性。",
	"In almost all cases, named components (such as a \"wooden stock\" for a crossbow) can be simply abstracted out as a minor cost, but, as always, the level of abstraction is up to the GM.": "在几乎所有的情况下，被命名的部件（如弩的 \"木制枪托\"）可以简单地被抽象为一个小费用，但是，一如既往，抽象的程度取决于GM。",
	"The other main way to acquire parts is to salvage them. What can be salvaged is determined by the GM, but in general common items provide parts, uncommon or expensive items may provide fancy parts, and esoteric parts are found only from esoteric sources at your GM's discretion. Tools, vehicles, and complex items generally return 1d4 metal scraps and 1d4 parts for a Small or smaller item, 2d6 metal scraps for a Medium-sized item, 3d8 metal scraps for a Large-sized item, and more for larger items, though they may return less of rare types of parts.": "获得零件的另一个主要途径是打捞。哪些东西可以打捞是由GM决定的，但一般来说，普通物品可以提供零件，不常见的或昂贵的物品可以提供花哨的零件，而深奥的零件只能从深奥的来源找到，由GM决定。工具、车辆和复杂的物品，一般来说，小型或较小的物品会返回1d4个金属碎片和1d4个零件，中型物品会返回2d6个金属碎片，大型物品会返回3d8个金属碎片，大型物品会返回更多，不过它们可能会返回较少的稀有类型的零件。",
	"Commonly available in its lowest quality (firewood), higher quality woods are often found in rather exotic locations. Wooden branches (including wood scraps) are assumed to be of a useful wood that can be worked, while firewood covers everything else, with more useful woods falling into categories such as \"quality branches\" or rarer options. Wood scraps are assumed to be scraps of common branch quality wood, and consequently can't be salvaged from firewood.": "常见的是最低质量的木材（木柴），更高质量的木材往往在相当奇特的地方发现。木枝（包括木屑）被认为是可以加工的有用木材，而木柴则涵盖其他一切，更有用的木材属于 \"优质树枝 \"或更稀有的选择。木屑被认为是普通树枝质量的木材碎片，因此不能从木柴中捞取。",
	"Wooden branches can be assumed to weigh 2 pounds each.": "木质树枝可以假设每根重量为2磅。",
	"For the most part, wood can't be easily salvaged. Wood carving is not necessarily a reversible process, and wood can't be smelted down.": "在大多数情况下，木材是不容易被挽救的。木雕不一定是一个可逆转的过程，木材也不能被冶炼下来。",
	"You can render wooden crafted product into wood scraps equal to 4 x the number of branches used to create it.": "你可以将木制工艺产品渲染成相当于4倍于制作该产品的树枝数量的木屑。",
	"A quality branch refers to one that can be made into more precious objects, particularly bows. It is nonmagical in nature, but typically yew when dealing with bows, though ash, mulberry, elm, oak, hickory, hazel, and maple can be used under broader definitions.": "优质树枝指的是可以制作更多珍贵物品的树枝，尤其是弓。它在本质上是非魔法的，但在处理弓箭时通常是紫杉，尽管在更广泛的定义下可以使用白蜡树、桑树、榆树、橡木、山核桃、榛树和枫树。",
	"Harvesting and looting are two paths to the same place, but generally depend on what kind of foe was vanquished and you are now collecting the \"stuff\" of. Typically humanoid creatures that carry stuff are candidates for the Individual Treasure tables, while Aberrations, Beasts, Dragons, Monstrosities, and Plants are harvesting candidates.": "收获和掠夺是通向同一个地方的两条途径，但通常取决于你战胜的是哪种敌人，你现在要收集的是哪种 \"东西\"。通常，携带东西的人形生物是个人宝藏表的候选者，而异形、野兽、龙、怪兽和植物则是收获的候选者。",

	"Remember that you can fully mix and match as it makes sense. You can replace coinage with gems or art pieces, you can replace crafting items that wouldn't make sense with coinage, gems, or art pieces, etc. The tables are merely a guide and convenience for what sort of range of materials should come from what sort of creature.": "记住，你可以完全混合和匹配，因为它是有意义的。你可以用宝石或艺术作品代替硬币，你可以用硬币、宝石或艺术作品代替没有意义的工艺物品，等等。这些表格只是一个指南和方便，说明什么样的材料范围应该来自什么样的生物。",

	"Rather than replacing the hoard tables, simply use the default hoard table and replace an amount of coins, gems, and art pieces with crafting materials. This ensures that players are still getting the sort of loot they expect, but also fills in new materials into things that would often fill little role beside being converted to coinage at a later date.": "与其替换囤积表，不如简单地使用默认的囤积表，用制作材料替换一定数量的硬币、宝石和艺术品。这确保了玩家仍然能得到他们所期望的那种战利品，同时也将新的材料填充到那些除了在以后被转化为硬币之外通常没有什么作用的东西中。",

The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and doesn't change once it is created.": "有些炼金术的创造物会触发一个蓄力动作。在这种情况下，以下是计算蓄力的公式。蓄力是在创造的时候根据创造者的属性和熟练程度计算的，一旦创造出来就不会改变。",
	"While herbalism is primarily used for gathering herbs, a creature with proficiency with herbalism kits has a limited proficiency in creating potions in addition to gathering herbs.

Caius rolls a 54.": "巫师Caius被一个巨大的植物怪物吃掉后获救。他想知道他的痛苦是否有价值，所以他问GM是否有任何战利品。没有。有什么可以从怪物那里收获的东西吗？嗯，这总是有可能的。GM问了一个D100。卡厄斯掷出了54分。",
	"It was just a CR 4 monster, so the GM consults the table and asks for a DC 8 Nature Check. Fortunately Caius the Wizard has a +3, so only needs a 5, and rolls an 8. Harvesting successful and now he has 1 common curative reagent.": "它只是一个CR 4的怪物，所以GM查阅了表格，要求进行DC 8自然检查。幸运的是，巫师凯厄斯有一个+3，所以只需要一个5，并且掷出了8。",
	"Knowing that he's going to need some healing potions to survive the next plant monster, he consults the table and realizes that with just 2 more curative reagents and a glass vial he'd have enough materials.": "他知道自己需要一些治疗药水才能在下一个植物怪物面前幸存下来，于是他查看了桌子，发现只要再有两个治疗试剂和一个玻璃瓶，他就有足够的材料。",
	"Next time they walk through a forest, Caius the Wizard asks the GM if there are any reagents about. Slowing down to a slow pass, he can make a gathering check with disadvantage, and attempts to gather reagents. Rolls the d100, and comes up with a 73. The GM asks for a DC 10 gathering check using herbalism kit, with disadvantage as they were travelling. Caius doesn't have proficiency, but has +1 wisdom, so needs a 9 or higher. He rolls a 14!": "下次他们走过森林时，巫师凯厄斯问GM附近是否有任何试剂。他放慢脚步缓慢通过，可以用劣势进行采集检查，并试图采集试剂。掷出d100，结果是73。GM要求用草药包进行DC10采集检查，由于他们是在旅行中，所以有劣势。卡厄斯没有熟练度，但有+1智慧，所以需要9分或更高。他掷出了14分。",
	"The results in 1d4 common curative reagents. He rolls a 2. That's all the curative reagents he needed! He cleans out the remains of an old healing potion to get a glass vial, and next time they camp, he spends his camp action (2 hours) trying to make a healing potion.": "结果是1d4个普通治疗试剂。他掷了一个2，这就是他所需要的所有治疗性试剂！他清理了一个旧的治疗性药水的残骸，得到一个玻璃瓶。他清理了一个旧的治疗药水的残骸，得到一个玻璃瓶，下次他们扎营时，他用他的扎营行动（2小时）来尝试制作一个治疗药水。",
