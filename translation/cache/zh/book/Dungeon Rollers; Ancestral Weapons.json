	"A noble blade wielded in the blood wars, an axe used to protect the great city of Mirabar from orc invasions, or a powerful staff passed down through the aeons. Ancestral weapons, heirlooms, are iconic within roleplaying. These weapons embody a character's family, story, and their history. These weapons are as important to many characters as their race, class, or background, to these people the opportunity to carry these items in their adventures is the true reward.": "一把在血战中挥舞的高贵的刀，一把用来保护伟大的米拉巴尔城免遭兽人入侵的斧头，或者一根流传下来的强大的法杖。祖传的武器，传家宝，在角色扮演中具有标志性意义。这些武器体现了一个角色的家庭、故事和他们的历史。这些武器对许多角色来说和他们的种族、阶级或背景一样重要，对这些人来说，在冒险中携带这些物品的机会是真正的奖励。",
	"Many of the legendary items within the Dungeons and Dragons universe could be classified as an ancestral weapon, such as the Blackstaff, wielded by the Archmage of Waterdeep. This powerful staff was originally wielded by Khelben Arunsun, and has been passed down through the ages, with seven generations now having wielded this powerful artifact. The holder of this staff becomes known by the same name as the weapon, Blackstaff, and becomes master of the Blackstaff Tower. Currently wielded by Vajra Safahr, this weapon is as important in the history books as whoever bears this powerful talisman. It is recognised by those near and far as a symbol of strength.": "龙与地下城宇宙中的许多传奇物品都可以被归类为祖传武器，比如水底大法师所挥舞的黑杖。这个强大的法杖最初是由Khelben Arunsun挥舞的，并且一直流传下来，现在已经有七代人挥舞过这个强大的神器。持有这根法杖的人被称为与武器同名的黑杖，并成为黑杖塔的主人。目前由金刚萨法尔（Vajra Safahr）挥舞，这把武器在历史书中的重要性不亚于持有这一强大护身符的人。它被远近的人认可为力量的象征。",
	"Ancestral weapons are not simply magic items to be discovered in a dusty vault, gifted by a thankful being, or wrestled from a terrible overlord. These weapons are cared for, honored and respected, and a mark of family, friendship, and history.": "祖传武器不是简单的魔法物品，可以在尘封的金库中被发现，由一个感恩的人赠予，或从一个可怕的霸主手中夺取。这些武器受到呵护、尊重和尊敬，是家庭、友谊和历史的标志。",
	"Ancestral weapons contains all the rules you need to bring these powerful items into your Dungeons and Dragons games. A character with an ancestral weapon will have it level up with them throughout the campaign. These weapons will develop their own unique traits and abilities to match their story and each character's playstyle.": "祖传武器包含所有你需要的规则，将这些强大的物品带入你的龙与地下城游戏。拥有祖传武器的角色会在整个战役中让它与他们一起升级。这些武器会发展出自己独特的特性和能力，以配合他们的故事和每个角色的游戏风格。",
	"As the character performs acts that honor the memories of the ancestors who previously wielded this weapon, it will grow in power, unlocking upgrades that keep the item relevant through the campaign.": "当角色做出纪念以前挥舞这把武器的祖先的行为时，它的力量就会增长，解锁升级，使该物品在整个战役中保持相关性。",
	"There are over 130 different upgrades presented in this tome, everything from acting faster in the initiative order, to casting spells from the weapon. From dealing thunder damage when you strike an opponent to giving the wielder the power of flight. With tens of millions of possible combinations, these weapons can truly be shaped by your characters and their history. No longer will they cast aside their family blade when a +1 longsword turns up in a goblin.": "这本小册子中提出了超过130种不同的升级，从主动权排序中的行动速度，到从武器中施放法术，无所不包。从打击对手时造成雷霆伤害到赋予持枪者飞行的能力。有了数以千万计的可能组合，这些武器可以真正被你的角色和他们的历史所塑造。当一把+1的长剑出现在一个地精身上时，他们不再会把他们的家族之刃丢在一边。",
	"The ‘Spirit Points' system represents the power imbued in each ancestral weapon by the deeds it has wrought and the power of its forebearers. By using this system, the weapon will level up alongside a character.": "精神点数 \"系统代表了每件祖传武器的力量，是由它所做的事情和它的祖先的力量所灌输的。通过使用这个系统，武器将与角色一起提升等级。",
	"These points are handed out based on storyline progression, much as you would with other magic items. This means the character does not miss out on gaining these rewards as they progress through a story, earning spirit points is much like gaining a new magic weapon.": "这些积分是根据故事情节的进展发放的，就像你对其他魔法物品一样。这意味着角色在故事进展中不会错过获得这些奖励的机会，赚取精神点数很像获得新的魔法武器。",
	"Due to the flexibility of the spirit points system, this module also includes rules for generating standard magic weapons for Dungeon Masters to use in their games. Allowing you to quickly create anything from a simple uncommon rapier wielded by a bandit captain, to a legendary greataxe wielded by the Dwarven kings of old.": "由于精神点数系统的灵活性，本模块还包括生成标准魔法武器的规则，供地下城主在游戏中使用。允许你快速创建任何东西，从一个强盗队长挥舞的简单的不常见的剑，到古老的矮人国王挥舞的传奇大斧。",
	"Additionally, there are rules to allow the use of spirit points to craft magic weapons, including costs, time, and the usage of quest-driving unique reagents. This allows characters to forge their own thematic items through the cause of your campaigns.": "此外，还有规则允许使用精神点来制作魔法武器，包括成本、时间和任务驱动的独特试剂的使用。这允许角色通过你的活动的原因锻造自己的主题物品。",
	"This product can be used whenever a character has expressed in their backstory that they have had a family weapon passed down. Equally, you could decide that a character is to be gifted an ancestral weapon by a family member during the story. There are many reasons to include ancestral weaponry, and this extra level of character flexibility will be appreciated by the players.": "只要一个角色在其背景故事中表示他们有一件家族武器传下来，就可以使用这个产品。同样，你也可以决定一个角色在故事中被一个家庭成员赠予一件祖传武器。有很多理由可以将祖传武器包括在内，这种额外的角色灵活性会受到玩家的欢迎。",
	"The rules for upgrading allow for three separate ways to develop an ancestral weapon. The first is for the player to choose their upgrades, deciding what suits their character better. The second option is that the Dungeon Master decides on the upgrades, building the item on a predetermined path based on its history. Third, a DM may choose the options based on a character's actions. All of these options are equally as effective and depends on the group and players within as to which style suits you best.": "升级的规则允许有三种不同的方式来发展祖传武器。第一种是由玩家自己选择升级，决定什么更适合他们的角色。第二种选择是由地下城管理员决定升级，根据物品的历史在预先确定的路径上建造。第三，DM可以根据角色的行动来选择选项。所有这些选择都同样有效，至于哪种风格最适合你，取决于小组和内部的玩家。",
	"into Dungeons and Dragons. If there is an upgrade not contained within this module, and you think that would be suitable for this game, do not be afraid to add it. If you want the whole party to have these weapons, do it. There is no wrong way to use this product, so don your armor, grab your ancestral glaive, and it's time to write some history!": "到《龙与地下城》。如果这个模块中没有包含升级，而你认为这适合于这个游戏，不要害怕添加它。如果你想让整个队伍都拥有这些武器，那就去做吧。使用这个产品没有错误的方法，所以穿上你的盔甲，拿起你的祖先之杖，是时候写下一些历史了!",
	"The following rules allow for characters to wield these ancestral weapons, without being tempted to throw away their historical tribal glaive for the first magical weapon that crosses their path. As the player performs deeds seen as worthy in the eyes of their ancestors the weapon will earn Spirit Points. These points can be assigned, either by the DM or the player, to unlock powers within the weapon scaling it to the relevant content and allowing for a sense of progression. These upgrades can remain as the weapon grows in power, or be replaced with new more powerful abilities.": "下面的规则允许角色挥舞这些祖传的武器，而不至于为了第一件魔法武器而丢弃他们历史上的部落青铜器。当玩家完成了在他们祖先眼中有价值的行为时，该武器将获得精神点数。这些点数可以由管理员或玩家分配，以解锁武器内的力量，使其达到相关内容，并允许有一种进步感。这些升级可以随着武器力量的增长而保留，也可以被新的更强大的能力所取代。",
	"This system allows for weapons to be suited to the character and the heirloom's history, without causing an imbalance within the campaign. All ancestral weapons are magical, even when no upgrades are unlocked. Whilst not being sentient weapons, the powers are at the whim of the ancestors who wielded it. A character who uses the blade in ways that would bring great shame to their family may find the powers within it cease to function. At such a time, the weapon would perform as a mundane weapon of the same type, up until the ancestors deem the wielder worthy again.": "这个系统允许武器适合于角色和传家宝的历史，而不会造成战役中的不平衡。所有的祖传武器都有魔力，即使没有升级也是如此。虽然不是有生命的武器，但其力量是由挥舞它的祖先来决定的。如果一个角色使用这把刀的方式会给他们的家族带来巨大的耻辱，那么他可能会发现里面的力量不再发挥作用。在这种情况下，该武器将作为同类型的普通武器使用，直到祖先认为持刀者值得再次使用。",
	"Any character can wield an ancestral weapon. This should either be worked into the character's backstory or handed down to the character in a roleplay situation. An ancestral weapon that is found, or taken from a corpse, would not allow it s powers to be unlocked by the new bearer. Instead, an ancestral weapon held by a character not linked to the weapon by blood, or who has been gifted it, acts as a mundane weapon of that type.": "任何角色都可以挥舞祖传的武器。这应该被纳入角色的背景故事，或者在角色扮演的情况下传给角色。被发现的祖传武器，或从尸体上取下的祖传武器，不会让它的力量被新的持有者解锁。相反，一个与武器没有血缘关系的角色所持有的祖传武器，或者是被赠予的武器，就像该类型的普通武器一样。",
	"These rules work best when discussed with a player before a campaign begins, as they are largely story driven. It is entirely possible for a character who wields an ancestral weapon to not unlock any powers for it until later in a campaign, on a similar timeline to other players receiving magic weapons, or other similar upgrades.": "这些规则最好在活动开始前与玩家讨论，因为它们主要是由故事驱动的。一个使用祖传武器的角色完全有可能在战役的后期才解锁任何力量，这与其他玩家获得魔法武器或其他类似升级的时间线相似。",
	"Spirit Points are the currency with which ancestral weapons are upgraded, and new abilities unlocked. Every upgrade has a cost which is paid for with spirit points that have been handed out by the DM. The higher the spirit point cost, the stronger the ability.": "精神点数是用于升级祖传武器和解锁新能力的货币。每一次升级都有一个成本，用DM发放的精神点来支付。精神点的成本越高，能力就越强。",
	"A character will earn Spirit Points as they progress, at a rate of roughly 1 per character level - though it is strongly recommended that these points are kept separate from levelling and can be handed out in amounts varying from 1 to 5. A character should never have more than spirit points than their character level plus 2.": "一个角色会随着他们的进步而获得精神点数，大约是每一个角色等级1个--尽管强烈建议将这些点数与等级分开，可以以1到5不等的数量发放。一个角色的精神点数不应超过其角色等级加2。",
	"Spirit points are generally granted when a heroic, or a particularly evil (depending on the alignment of the character) act is performed. This could involve one of the following situations or similar:": "精神点数一般是在执行了一个英雄的，或一个特别邪恶的（取决于角色的排列）行为时被授予。这可能涉及以下情况之一或类似情况。",
	"A monstrous beast terrorizing the city is killed": "一头恐吓城市的怪兽被杀",
	"Revenge has been achieved, this could have a family link the weapon is invested in": "复仇已经实现，这可能有一个家庭的联系，武器的投资。",
	"Self sacrifice": "自我牺牲",
	"Achieving great renown": "获得巨大的声誉",
	"When spirit points are earned a weapon will glow, pulse or emanate a spectral aura, indicating to the player that their ancestors are rewarding them for their actions. When the weapon receives its 20th spirit point, it also gains an additional 5 spirit points as the weapon unlocks the full power of its ancestors.": "当获得精神点数时，武器会发光、跳动或发出幽灵般的光环，向玩家表明他们的祖先正在奖励他们的行为。当武器获得第20个精神点时，它还会获得额外的5个精神点，因为武器会释放其祖先的全部力量。",
	"Spirit points can be stored for future purchases, allowing a character to save up for more expensive upgrades. The rarity of an ancestral weapon is determined by the number of spirit points it currently has:": "精神点数可以储存起来以备将来购买，允许一个角色为更昂贵的升级而存钱。一件祖传武器的稀有程度由它目前拥有的精神点数决定。",
	"Common": "普通",
	"Uncommon": "不常见",
	"Very Rare": "非常罕见",
	"Legendary": "传说中的",
	"This ruleset is designed to be simple, flexible, and fun to use. The below steps show how to get started using ancestral weapons in your campaign.": "这套规则被设计成简单、灵活、有趣的使用方式。下面的步骤显示了如何在你的战役中开始使用祖传武器。",
	"These weapons are not appropriate for every character. Discuss with your players to find out where these are best placed. A Dragonborn barbarian from a noble tribe is more likely to wield an ancestral weapon than a orphan who was left on the streets with nothing. Though that is not to say they may not discover their true birthright in the course of the campaign!": "这些武器并不适合于每个角色。与你的玩家讨论一下，找出这些武器的最佳位置。一个来自贵族部落的龙裔野蛮人比一个一无所有的孤儿更有可能挥舞祖传的武器。但这并不是说他们不会在战役的过程中发现自己真正的出身。",
	"An ancestral weapon remains with a character for the entire campaign, and as such this decision is crucial. The character can pick any item from the weapons list, even if this would not be included in their normal starting equipment.": "祖传武器在整个战役中一直伴随着一个角色，因此这个决定是至关重要的。角色可以从武器列表中挑选任何物品，即使这并不包括在他们的正常起始装备中。",
	"The DM decides the number of spirit points the weapon starts with. This can be anywhere from 0 to Character Level +2.": "DM决定该武器开始时的精神点数。这可以是0到角色等级+2之间的任何地方。",
	"Follow the ‘Buying Upgrades' rules below to determine any starting upgrades.": "按照下面的 \"购买升级 \"规则来确定任何起始升级。",
	"During the campaign the ancestral weapon will gain spirit points, the following process should be following this occurring:": "在活动期间，祖传武器将获得精神点数，以下过程应该是按照这种情况发生的。",
	"The DM determines the number of spirit points earned. The total, included any previously awarded, shall not exceed Character Level +2.": "DM决定所获得的精神积分的数量。总数，包括任何先前授予的，不应超过角色等级+2。",
	"Either the player or the DM decides on any upgrades to be purchased, following the ‘Buying Upgrades' rules below. Any previously unspent points can also be spent in this step.": "玩家或管理员决定购买任何升级，遵循下面的 \"购买升级 \"规则。任何先前未使用的点数也可以在这一步中使用。",
	"Any unspent points are noted and stored for future purchases.": "任何未使用的积分都会被记录下来，并储存起来供将来购买使用。",
	"To add an upgrade to an ancestral weapon, a player must spend the number of spirit points as displayed in its description. A DM may choose to assign an upgrade to the ancestral weapon, instead of offering the player the spirit points directly. This represents the weapon having a predetermine path, unlocking powers it previously possessed. Some upgrades have a requirement, such as class, ability to cast spells, or type of weapon:": "要为祖传武器添加升级，玩家必须花费其描述中显示的精神点数。管理员可以选择为祖传武器指定一个升级，而不是直接向玩家提供精神点数。这代表该武器有一个预定的路径，可以解锁它以前拥有的力量。有些升级是有要求的，比如等级、施法能力或武器的类型。",
	"You have advantage on attacks with this weapon if you began your turn over 20 foot away from the target.": "如果你开始的回合距离目标超过20英尺，你用这种武器攻击时有优势。",
	"In these cases, if the requirements are not met, this upgrade may not be applied to this ancestral weapon. If already present, such as in the case of the weapon being gifted after being upgraded, these upgrades will have no effect.": "在这些情况下，如果不符合要求，这个升级可能不会应用于这个祖传武器。如果已经存在，例如在武器被升级后被赠送的情况下，这些升级将没有效果。",
	"Upgrades are grouped by ‘Tiers', which relate to the Tiers of play. Each Tier of upgrade are unlocked at certain levels, as detailed in Chapter 2. A character cannot add upgrades to an ancestral weapon unless they are of sufficient level.": "升级按 \"层级 \"分组，与游戏的层级有关。每个等级的升级都在一定的水平上解锁，详见第二章。一个角色不能给祖传武器添加升级，除非他们有足够的等级。",
	"You cannot remove upgrades unless you are overwriting them, or refocusing the weapon, both of which are detailed later in this chapter.": "你不能删除升级，除非你覆盖它们，或重新调整武器的焦点，这两点在本章后面会详细说明。",
	"You can never have two upgrades with the same name. Some upgrades have a level, or subtype, displayed next to their name. These upgrades count as having the same name for the purpose of duplication, and are shown by having additional the level or subtype information displayed in brackets in their title:": "你永远不可能有两个同名的升级。有些升级在其名称旁边有一个级别或子类型。这些升级算作具有相同的名称，并通过在其标题中的括号内显示额外的等级或子类型信息来显示。",
	"You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice.": "你获得对你所选择的一项技能的熟练程度。",
	"If the d20 roll for an attack made with this weapon is a 19 or 20, you can force a creature that suffers damage from this weapon to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw, in addition to any damage caused. On a failed save, it is knocked prone.": "如果用该武器进行攻击的D20卷是19或20，你可以强迫受到该武器伤害的生物进行DC14力量救赎，此外还有任何伤害。如果救赎失败，它将被击倒在地。",
	"Sometimes characters will perform actions that are disrespectful to the ancestors who wielded it. In this situation, at the DMs discretion, it is possible that the powers of the ancestral weapon will fail. During this time the weapon will count as a mundane weapon of its normal type, until such a time as the ancestor's respect has been renewed.": "有时人物会做出对挥舞它的祖先不敬的行为。在这种情况下，根据DM的判断，祖传武器的力量有可能会失效。在这段时间里，该武器将被算作普通类型的普通武器，直到祖先的敬意被重新唤起。",
	"Limited upgrades draw more power from the weapons ancestors. These upgrades have the limited tag alongside their cost:": "有限的升级从武器祖先那里获取更多的能量。这些升级在其成本旁边有一个有限的标签。",
	"You gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed.": "你获得的飞行速度与你的移动速度相等。",
	"Each ancestral weapon can only have 2 upgrades that are limited. If you have an item with a more than 2 limited upgrades, and wish to use another, you must overwrite one of the existing limited upgrades, following the overwriting rules found below.": "每件祖传武器只能有2个有限的升级。如果你有一个超过2个有限升级的物品，并希望使用另一个，你必须覆盖一个现有的有限升级，遵循下面的覆盖规则。",
	"Sometimes you will want to place an upgrade on an ancestral weapon, replacing one already there. To do this, when you buy the upgrade, you gain spirit points towards the upgrade equal to the original cost of the upgrade being overwritten.": "有时你会想在一件祖传武器上进行升级，取代已经存在的武器。要做到这一点，当你购买升级时，你将获得与被覆盖的升级的原始成本相等的精神点数。",
	"Isabella's family warhammer, The Heavensworn, was gifted by her grandmother. Currently the weapon has the ‘Enhanced Weapon (Level 1)' upgrade applied.": "伊莎贝拉的家族战锤 \"Heavensworn \"是由她的祖母赠送的。目前，这把武器已经应用了 \"强化武器（1级）\"的升级。",
	"After gaining spirit points for downing Alarich von Wulmarch, she chooses to add the upgrade ‘Enhanced Weapon (Level 2)'. She overwrites the current ability, refunding 3 spirit points from ‘Enhanced Weapon (level 1)', and pays 6 spirit points for ‘Enhanced Weapon (level 2)' - a net spend of 3 spirit points.": "在击倒阿拉里奇-冯-伍尔马奇获得精神点数后，她选择增加升级版'强化武器（2级）'。她覆盖了当前的能力，退还了'强化武器（1级）'的3点精神力，并为'强化武器（2级）'支付了6点精神力--净花费3点精神力。",
	"An upgrade can only ever overwrite a single other upgrade already on the weapon, you can never remove multiple other abilities in order to equip a single other upgrade.": "一个升级只能覆盖已经在武器上的一个其他升级，你永远不能为了装备一个其他升级而移除多个其他能力。",
	"Sometimes players may decide they wish to have a new effect on their ancestral weapon. It is up to the DM as to whether they allow the upgrades to be altered. This is called refocusing the weapon.": "有时，玩家可能会决定他们希望在他们的祖传武器上有一个新的效果。这取决于管理员是否允许改变升级的内容。这被称为重新聚焦武器。",
	"If a player wishes to refocus the weapon, it should not be a trivial matter. The player should complete a quest, perform a séance with their ancestors, or similar.": "如果玩家希望重新聚焦武器，这不应该是一件小事。玩家应该完成一个任务，与他们的祖先进行降神仪式，或者类似的。",
	"Despite the similarities of overwriting and refocusing, they are extremely different and should be used so.": "尽管覆盖和重新聚焦有相似之处，但它们极为不同，应如此使用。",
	"Overwriting is used during the normal purchasing of upgrades, replacing one upgrade at a time.": "覆盖是在正常购买升级的过程中使用的，每次替换一个升级。",
	"Refocusing is used in extreme circumstances when a character decides they are not satisfied with the current makeup of their weapon, and wishes to make multiple alterations. This requires the DMs approval.": "重新聚焦是在极端情况下使用的，当一个角色决定他们不满意他们的武器的当前构成，并希望进行多次修改。这需要DMs的批准。",
	"Several upgrades have the text \"per long rest\", or \"per short rest\". This is used to avoid the complication of weapons having multiple charges associated with different upgrades. These effects can be used a set number of times, after which you must complete the type of rest stated before you are able to use the upgrade again.": "有几项升级的文字是 \"每长时间休息 \"或 \"每短时间休息\"。这是为了避免武器与不同升级相关的多种费用的复杂化。这些效果可以使用一定的次数，之后你必须完成所述的休息类型才能再次使用升级。",
	"Ancestral weapons require attunement to the bearer before their abilities are usable. An ancestral weapon that is not attuned will act as a mundane weapon of the weapon's type. A character who begins a campaign with an ancestral weapon, is attuned to it immediately. In all other circumstances, the bearer of an ancestral weapon may only attune to the weapon if one of the following criteria is met:": "祖传武器需要在其能力使用前与持有者进行调和。没有被调整的祖传武器将作为该武器类型的普通武器使用。一个带着祖传武器开始活动的角色，会立即与它相适应。在所有其他情况下，只有在满足以下条件之一的情况下，祖传武器的持有者才能与该武器相适应。",
	"The creature must have received the weapon as a gift from a creature attuned to the item": "该生物必须从与该物品相适应的生物那里得到该武器作为礼物。",

	"In addition, the new bearer must keep the weapon on their person for at least one month before they attempt to attune to the item in the normal manner.": "此外，新的持有者必须将武器放在身上至少一个月，然后再尝试以正常的方式与物品相适应。",
	"Each time a creature attunes to an ancestral weapon, the DM must decide whether the weapon keeps at its current unlocked power level, starts at a reduced power level, or with 0 spirit points. In each case the new bearer can earn spirit points as normal. A character should not be gifted an ancestral weapon with spirit points greater than their current character level.": "每当一个生物适应一个祖传武器时，DM必须决定该武器是保持其当前解锁的力量水平，还是从降低的力量水平开始，或是以0精神点数开始。在每一种情况下，新的持有者都可以像平常一样获得精神点数。一个角色不应该被赠予一件精神点数高于其当前角色等级的祖传武器。",
	"Many ancestral weapons have small, minor effects that add character to the weapons. An ancestral item can start with these, or unlock them as more of its gifts are earnt. You can find a list of minor effects in Chapter 3: Ancestral Traits and Personalities of this module which will act as flavourful traits. The minor effects and quirks tables, found on page 143 of the Dungeon Master's Guide also provide you with a variety of options.": "许多祖传武器都有一些小的、轻微的效果，使武器更有特色。一件祖传物品开始时可以有这些效果，也可以随着获得更多的天赋而解锁它们。你可以在本模块的第3章：祖传特征和个性中找到一个次要效果的清单，它们将作为有味道的特征。地牢管理员指南》第143页的次要效果和怪癖表也为你提供了多种选择。",
	"If you wish to create these yourself, it is recommended that the item does not materially effect in game situations, and are instead designed just to add flavour to the item.": "如果你想自己创造这些东西，建议该项目对游戏中的情况没有实质性的影响，而只是为了增加项目的风味。",
	"When adding ancestor traits, you should consider the background of the weapon. Who wielded the the weapon? Where was it used? What foes has it vanquished? What race crafted it? You can create this content yourself, or use the tables in Chapter 3 to help you randomly develop this.": "在添加祖先特征时，你应该考虑武器的背景。谁挥舞过这把武器？它在哪里被使用？它战胜了哪些敌人？什么种族制作了它？你可以自己创建这些内容，或者使用第三章中的表格来帮助你随机开发这些内容。",
	"This chapter describes the upgrades available for ancestral weapons. The chapter begins with a summary of the upgrades, sorted by minimum level requirement in order to equip them to an item.

Limited upgrades are listed before any other upgrades.": "本章介绍了祖传武器的升级。本章首先对升级进行了总结，并按装备它们的最低等级要求进行了排序。这些等级要求与《玩家手册》（第15页）中描述的游戏层级有关。在这之后，你会发现所有的升级按字母顺序排列，也是按最低等级排列。有限的升级会列在任何其他升级之前。",
