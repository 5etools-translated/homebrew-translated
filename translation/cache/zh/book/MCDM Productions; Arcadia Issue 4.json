	"The library's strongest defense is the curse it bestows on thieves: a creature who leaves the library with one of its books must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at dawn the following day or take 5 ({@damage 1d10}) necrotic damage as its hands start to blacken and rot. A creature who fails the save must also roll one Hit Die. Its hit point maximum is permanently reduced by the amount on the die, and its Hit Dice are permanently reduced by one. The rot spreads daily, spreading up the arms, over the body, and eventually up to the creature's face. The thief must repeat the save at dawn each day, whether they succeed or fail. The greater restoration spell restores the creature's hit point maximum and total number of Hit Dice, but the thief must keep making saving throws each day until they return the book to its correct place in the library. When the victim's total number of Hit Dice or hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies.": "图书馆最强的防御是它对盗贼的诅咒：带着图书馆的书离开图书馆的生物必须在第二天黎明时在DC16宪法救赎中成功，否则会受到5（%0%）的坏死伤害，因为它的手开始变黑和腐烂。拯救失败的生物也必须掷出一个命中率。它的最大命中率会永久性地减少，其命中率也会永久性地减少一个。腐烂每天都在蔓延，从手臂到身体，最后到达生物的面部。盗贼必须在每天黎明时分重复拯救，无论他们是成功还是失败。更大的恢复咒语恢复了生物的最大命中率和总命中率，但是盗贼必须每天不断地进行拯救，直到他们把书放回图书馆的正确位置。当受害者的总命中率或最大命中率下降到0时，它就会死亡。",
	"There is one entrance to the Chained Library: bronze double doors set in the cliffside, inlaid with sigils of protection and runes to dispel magic—and sealed by thirteen locks both magical and mundane. The doors are opened briefly each sunrise to admit any visitors who wait in the black ash desert beyond, where vulture-like birdfolk prey on weakened, sunstruck travelers.": "枷锁图书馆只有一个入口：青铜色的双门镶嵌在悬崖边上，镶嵌着保护的符号和驱散魔法的符文，并由13把魔法和世俗的锁密封。每天日出时分，大门会短暂打开，接纳在黑灰沙漠中等待的任何访客，在那里，秃鹫般的鸟人会捕食虚弱的、被太阳晒伤的旅行者。",
	"Stored on the library's first floor, the Howling Shelves make up the majority of the collection. Here, the librarians store spellbooks and research notes, tomes of demonology, and other dangerous, but possibly useful knowledge. The eyeless guardians patrol the area, where each book is chained to the shelves with adamantium links. Librarians habitually enter this area in pairs, each watching the other to ensure they're not tempted to read any of the books.": "嚎叫书架存放在图书馆的一楼，构成了大部分的收藏。在这里，图书管理员储存了法术书和研究笔记、恶魔学的书目，以及其他危险但可能有用的知识。无眼守护者在这里巡逻，每本书都用金刚砂链子拴在书架上。图书馆员们习惯性地成双成对地进入这个区域，每个人都看着对方，以确保他们不会被诱惑去阅读任何书籍。",
	"The eyeless guardians visit the Deep Stacks only when ordered to do so, and the librarians don't come here at all: the books here are too dangerous, intelligent and malevolent to risk humanoid contact.": "无眼守护者只有在接到命令时才会访问深层书库，而图书管理员根本不来这里：这里的书太危险了，太聪明了，太邪恶了，不能冒险与人接触。",
	"The Deep Stacks are the lowest level of the library, a sump of threatening arcane power. These malevolent prisoners long for someone to read them, hoping to possess a living creature who can leave the library.": "深层书架是图书馆的最底层，是威胁性奥术力量的集散地。这些恶毒的囚犯渴望有人阅读它们，希望能拥有一个能离开图书馆的活物。",
	"Each book is capable of communicating and has its own agenda. The way the book communicates and its agenda can be chosen or rolled on the tables below.": "每本书都能够交流，并有自己的议程。书的沟通方式和它的议程可以在下面的表格中选择或滚动。",
	"The book communicates by transmitting emotions and images to creatures within 30 feet of it.": "这本书通过向周围30英尺内的生物传递情绪和图像来进行交流。",
	"The book can communicate telepathically with any creature that understands a language within 30 feet of it.": "这本书可以与它周围30英尺内任何懂得某种语言的生物进行心灵感应。",
	"Summon a powerful extraplanar entity": "召唤一个强大的星外实体",
	"Reunite with its former master, a powerful wizard or lich": "与它以前的主人，一个强大的巫师或巫师重聚。",
	"Destroy an old enemy and everyone they hold dear": "摧毁一个旧的敌人和他们所珍视的所有人",
	"Consume 100 other books, gaining power with each one": "消耗其他100本书，每本书都能获得力量",
	"Bring down a kingdom": "打倒一个王国",
	"Destroy the Chained Library": "摧毁链式图书馆",
	"Accommodations for scribes and librarians take up the majority of the library's second level. An enchanted cauldron provides food and water in the refectory, the residents sleep in simple, spartan dormitories, and a suite of training rooms are used for magical instruction, practicing stealth and tracking, and combat lessons with swords and daggers. Agents must be able to defend themselves, after all.": "文士和图书管理员的住所占据了图书馆第二层的大部分空间。一个被施了魔法的大锅在食堂里提供食物和水，居民们睡在简单、简陋的宿舍里，还有一套训练室用于魔法教学、练习隐身和追踪，以及用剑和匕首进行战斗的课程。毕竟，特工必须有能力保护自己。",
	"In the Scriptorium, scribes sit in walled, warded cubicles making copies of books so damaged or aged that their contents are in danger of destruction. No matter how dangerous the contents, there must always be a viable and accurate copy in existence.": "在圣经馆里，文士们坐在有墙的、有围墙的隔间里，对损坏或老化的书籍进行复制，使其内容面临毁灭的危险。无论内容多么危险，都必须有一个可行的、准确的副本存在。",
	"Exposure to these books can poison the mind. The scribes never speak of their work, and most wear scribe's lenses that keep them from understanding the words and images they copy. Despite this precaution, ideas leak in; scribes suffer from nightmares, and occasionally more serious consequences, such as repeating the half-remembered lore of the texts to their colleagues, unleashing dangerous ideas that are trapped in paper for good reason.": "接触这些书会毒害人的心灵。文士们从不谈论他们的工作，而且大多数人戴着文士镜片，使他们无法理解他们所抄写的文字和图像。尽管有这样的预防措施，思想还是会泄露出去；抄写员们会做噩梦，偶尔会有更严重的后果，比如向他们的同事重复那些半生不熟的文字传说，释放出被困在纸上的危险思想，这是有原因的。",
	"The following NPCs are librarians you can add to your game or use as inspiration to create your own library staff. There are dozens of librarians within the Chained Library, representing every humanoid ancestry and origin.": "下面的NPC是图书馆员，你可以把他们加入到你的游戏中，或者作为灵感来创造你自己的图书馆工作人员。链式图书馆内有几十个图书馆员，代表了每一个人形生物的祖先和起源。",
	"Samaris, an ancient tiefling with long black horns, is the oldest of the librarians. She despises every book in the library and dreams nightly about setting fire to the entire collection for the good of the world. Samaris mistrusts anyone who asks to read one of the books and sends agents of the library to shadow visitors after they leave, waiting for those guests to prove their corruption so she can order their assassination.": "萨马里斯，一个长着黑色长角的古老铁弗林，是图书馆管理员中最老的一个。她鄙视图书馆里的每一本书，每晚都梦想着为了世界的利益放火烧掉所有的藏书。萨马里斯不信任任何要求阅读其中一本书的人，并在访客离开后派图书馆的特工跟踪他们，等待这些客人证明他们的腐败，以便她能下令暗杀他们。",
	"The young human Alois is the newest addition to the library's staff. They arrived the same way all the librarians do: following a calling in their dreams. Alois isn't convinced that the books they guard are evil: they are, after all, just books. When they can, Alois slips into the Howling Shelves and browses the texts there. They haven't yet had an opportunity to venture into the Deep Stacks, but one day they will.": "年轻的人类阿洛伊斯是图书馆工作人员中的新成员。他们和所有的图书馆员一样来到这里：遵循梦中的召唤。阿洛伊斯并不相信他们所守护的书籍是邪恶的：它们毕竟只是书籍。当他们可以时，阿洛伊斯溜进嚎叫的书架，浏览那里的文本。他们还没有机会冒险进入深层书架，但总有一天他们会的。",
	"The Chained Library's agents are everywhere, from major cities to the halls of academia, trawling secondhand book markets and private collections. They use whatever tactics necessary to obtain their prizes. They visit auctions and merchants, using the library's sizable budget to buy up what they can. For books not on the market, they use blackmail, bribery, and theft. Occasionally, a wealthy aristocrat or powerful mage is murdered, and the only things missing from the crime scene are a couple of precious books. The agents' activities are consistent in only one way: that no books are harmed or destroyed, no matter how dangerous they are. The Chained Library is capable of storing anything, and the destruction of knowledge is sacrilege.": "枷锁图书馆的代理人无处不在，从大城市到学术界的大厅，在二手书市场和私人收藏中翻找。他们使用任何必要的手段来获得他们的奖品。他们访问拍卖会和商人，利用图书馆的可观预算来购买他们能买到的东西。对于市场上没有的书籍，他们使用敲诈、贿赂和盗窃。偶尔，一个富有的贵族或强大的法师被谋杀，而犯罪现场唯一丢失的东西就是几本珍贵的书。特工们的活动只有在一个方面是一致的：不伤害或破坏任何书籍，无论它们多么危险。枷锁图书馆能够储存任何东西，破坏知识就是亵渎。",
	"The library agents exist to remove dangerous books from circulation in the outside world. This includes books of dark magic, the spellbooks of liches and evil mages, the secrets of wicked gods, and knowledge that could be used to open pathways to other planes: things not of the material world that could fundamentally threaten life there. The agents take no interest in material that is politically dangerous—many rulers have tried to recruit the library to suppress inconvenient or threatening information, but the organization is profoundly uninterested.": "图书馆特工的存在是为了将危险的书籍从外部世界的流通中移除。这包括黑魔法书籍、地衣和邪恶法师的法术书、邪恶之神的秘密，以及可以用来打开通往其他星球的通道的知识：不属于物质世界的东西，可能从根本上威胁到那里的生命。代理人对政治上危险的材料不感兴趣--许多统治者试图招募图书馆来压制不方便或有威胁的信息，但该组织对此深感兴趣。",
	"The Chained Library has numerous agents. The NPCs below are examples you can include in your game or use as inspiration for NPCs of your own.": "Chained图书馆有许多代理人。下面的NPC是你可以在你的游戏中加入的例子，或者作为你自己的NPC的灵感。",
	"Agents of the library recognize one another by the magical tattoos on their right index finger: a line of Common script reading, \"Close your mind,\" encircled by chains. The tattoos are visible to creatures with truesight. The tattoos use special ink which allows a detect magic spell to reveal them.": "图书馆的特工们通过他们右手食指上的魔法纹身认出彼此：一行普通的文字，上面写着 \"闭上你的头脑\"，周围是锁链。纹身对具有真实视力的生物来说是可见的。纹身使用了特殊的墨水，可以通过探测魔法的咒语来揭示它们。",
	"Vornak is a towering, tusked half-orc who liaises with private collectors of books and scrolls. A well-dressed, well-spoken man with a faint lisp, he's quite the conversationalist and raconteur.": "沃纳克是一个高大的、长着獠牙的半兽人，他负责与书籍和卷轴的私人收藏家联系。他衣着光鲜，言谈举止得体，带着淡淡的口音，是个相当好的谈话者和说书人。",
	"Most of the texts the library obtains come from people with academic or financial interests in such things. These are Vornak's clients. He has a knack for finding equally rare books that suit these collectors' interests but possess no value for the Chained Library. He arranges sales and exchanges, and maintains a network of contacts who inform him when potentially interesting texts appear. Vornak is always in need of mercenaries to obtain the books that are his stock in trade.": "图书馆获得的大部分文本来自于对此类事物有学术或经济利益的人。这些是沃纳克的客户。他善于寻找同样罕见的书籍，这些书籍符合这些收藏家的兴趣，但对链式图书馆来说没有价值。他安排销售和交换，并保持一个联络网，当潜在的有趣文本出现时，他们会通知他。沃纳克总是需要雇佣兵来获取作为他贸易储备的书籍。",
	"The slight, freckled, half-elf thief Keledra steps in where money and blandishments fail. She follows tips from her network, the thieves and scoundrels she worked with before the Chained Library recruited her. Her work is as dangerous as the books she steals. She slips into the secured sanctums of people who obtain tomes of evil magic with the intent to use them. Keledra takes her work seriously: she trains hard and picks up magical skills where she can to complement her deft hands. Keledra trusts few people and works alone, but she finds her path crossing with the same foes time and again as rivals, guards, and targets.": "身材矮小、满脸雀斑的半精灵盗贼凯尔德拉在金钱和贿赂失败的情况下出手。她遵循她的网络提供的提示，即在链式图书馆招募她之前与她合作的小偷和恶棍。她的工作和她所偷的书一样危险。她溜进那些获得邪恶魔法书籍并打算使用它们的人的安全圣地。凯勒德拉认真对待她的工作：她努力训练，并在可能的地方学习魔法技能，以补充她灵巧的双手。凯尔德拉几乎不信任任何人，她独自工作，但她发现她的道路一次又一次地与同样的敌人交汇，成为对手、守卫和目标。",
	"A party of adventurers might encounter the Chained Library and its agents as allies, enemies, or both at different times. The first four adventure hooks presented below serve as introductions to the Chained Library; the last five are better used once a connection has been established.": "一组冒险者可能会在不同的时间遇到锁链图书馆和它的代理人，作为盟友，作为敌人，或者两者都是。下面介绍的前四个冒险钩子是对链锁图书馆的介绍；后五个钩子最好在建立联系后使用。",
	"The characters and one or more agents of the library explore the same ruin or tomb. It's dangerous work, and the two groups are safer together. The agents get their prize, and the characters get theirs—unless one side is lying about what they really want.": "人物和图书馆的一个或多个代理人探索同一个废墟或坟墓。这是一项危险的工作，两组人在一起比较安全。探员们得到了他们的奖品，而角色们也得到了他们的奖品--除非有一方对他们真正想要的东西撒谎。",
	"A friendly NPC patron employs the characters to catch a skilled thief plaguing the libraries of learned folk. Once caught, the thief explains her mission: she's relieving a cult of infernalists of their source material and taking it into safekeeping at the Chained Library. What do the characters do with the knowledge that their employers are in league with fiends?": "一个友好的NPC赞助人雇佣角色们去抓一个困扰学识渊博的图书馆的熟练小偷。一旦被抓到，小偷解释了她的任务：她要把一个邪教组织的原始资料解救出来，并把它们安全地保存在锁链图书馆。角色们知道他们的雇主与魔鬼为伍后，会怎么做呢？",
	"The characters have come into possession of a book the library's agents claim should be safely locked away. They're willing to pay a significant price, but the characters need the book to defeat a great evil.": "这些人物得到了一本书，图书馆的代理人声称它应该被安全地锁起来。他们愿意付出巨大的代价，但这些人物需要这本书来打败一个巨大的恶魔。",
	"The characters want one or more books from the estate of a deceased mage. Agents of the Chained Library have their eyes on several of the same tomes. Social and political maneuvering, bribery, blackmail, and threats all follow...plus whatever chaos the characters inevitably add to the mix.": "这些人物希望从一位已故法师的遗产中得到一本或多本书籍。枷锁图书馆的特工们也盯上了几本相同的书。社会和政治操纵、贿赂、勒索和威胁都随之而来......再加上角色们不可避免地加入的任何混乱。",
	"One of the library's scribes read something they shouldn't, and now they're burdened by terrible knowledge that's unraveling their mind and demanding to be used. If the characters don't stop the scribe, the librarian causes terrible harm. To complicate matters, the library is loath to kill one of their own and wants to see the scribe protected and healed.": "图书馆的一个抄写员读了一些他们不应该读的东西，现在他们被可怕的知识所困扰，这些知识正在解开他们的心结，并要求被使用。如果角色们不阻止抄写员，图书馆员就会造成可怕的伤害。让事情变得复杂的是，图书馆不愿意杀死自己人，希望看到文士得到保护和治疗。",
	"Either the characters failed the test in the \"Prospective Readers\" adventure hook, or the book they sought is in the Deep Stacks, never to be looked upon. They must infiltrate or breach the library by force.": "要么人物没有通过 \"准读者 \"冒险钩子的测试，要么他们寻找的书就在深层书架上，永远不会被人看到。他们必须潜入或用武力突破图书馆。",
	"The characters need access to knowledge contained within the library. But to be admitted to the library, they must pass three trials to prove their virtue and moral fiber.": "这些人物需要获得图书馆内的知识。但要进入图书馆，他们必须通过三个考验，以证明他们的美德和道德品质。",
	"Books from the library make their way onto the market. Why? Who is allowing this? Has a thief plundered the library, or is there a traitor inside?": "来自图书馆的书籍进入了市场。为什么？谁允许这样做？是盗贼掠夺了图书馆，还是里面有叛徒？",
	"The characters have come into possession of a book full of vile secrets. They must find the library or its agents to get rid of the wretched tome. This adventure can lead into any other plot hook where the library requires the characters' assistance.": "这些人物拥有一本充满卑鄙秘密的书。他们必须找到图书馆或其代理人，以摆脱这本可恶的书。这个冒险可以引出图书馆需要人物协助的任何其他情节线索。",
