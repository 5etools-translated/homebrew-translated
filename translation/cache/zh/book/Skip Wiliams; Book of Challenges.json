	"Picture this situation: The player characters see a ges ticulating wizard floating over a dark chasm. As if by magic, a light goes on in a player's brain. He declares that his character charges headlong off the edge of the cliff, expecting that he'll continue across the invis ible bridge that doubtless spans the chasm.": "想象一下这种情况。玩家角色看到一个在黑暗的鸿沟上漂浮的手势巫师。就像施了魔法一样，玩家的大脑中亮起了一盏灯。他宣布他的角色从悬崖边上一头冲了下去，希望他能继续穿过那座看不见的桥，那座桥无疑是横跨在鸿沟上的。",
	"What do you do in this situation?": "在这种情况下，你会怎么做？",
	"Despite your natural inclination to let the player kill off his character, your reflexes probably kick in. You laugh, or you cock an eyebrow, or you say, \"Ohhh-kay?\" after you spit out your drink. With a flash of insight, the player realizes that there may be other explanations why the wizard can defy grav ity. Maybe, just maybe, you'll let him halt his charge before he discovers the exact depth of the chasm the hard way.": "尽管你自然倾向于让玩家杀了他的角色，但你的条件反射可能会启动。你笑了，或者你挑了挑眉毛，或者在你吐出饮料后说，\"哦，好吧？随着洞察力的闪现，玩家意识到，可能还有其他的解释，为什么巫师可以藐视重力。也许，只是也许，在他发现鸿沟的确切深度之前，你会让他停止冲锋。",
	"Then you realize you have fallen prey again to the DM's Dirty Little Secret: you're really on the players' side. You use your omniscience and omnipotence to keep your PCs alive and happy (at least in the long term, resurrections being what they are). You don't tell your players that, though, because they keep putting their precious PCs in situations where you have to pull their fat out of the fireball. After all, you have a responsibility to keep them coming back.": "然后你意识到你又陷入了DM的肮脏的小秘密：你真的是站在玩家一边的。你用你的全知和全能来保持你的NPC的生存和快乐（至少从长远来看，复活就是这样）。但你并没有告诉你的玩家，因为他们一直把他们宝贵的PC放在你必须把他们的脂肪从火球中拉出来的情况下。毕竟，你有责任让他们继续回来。",
	"And some days, that responsibility gets to you. You're not a fifth or sixth or seventh PC. You're the Dungeon Master. Some days, you get that urge to show them you're not on their side, and that you have the power and cleverness to let them know who's boss.": "有些时候，这种责任会让你感到不安。你不是第五个或第六个或第七个PC。你是地下城主。有些时候，你会有一种冲动，想让他们知道你不在他们一边，你有能力和智慧让他们知道谁是老大。",
	"Welcome to the book that's designed for those bad dice days. The Book of Challenges: Dungeon Rooms, Puzzles, and Traps is composed of dozens of the smartest and meanest encounters we could envision. This is the book of \"Oh, man!\" and \"I can't believe it!\" and \"You have to be kidding me!\" Yes, the encounters are balanced by encounter level, and yes, they can all be solved with a little thought. Yes, we even provide hints you can give your players. But fundamentally, they're all just a bit nasty. If a player announces that he's going over a cliff in one of these encounters, he's going over the cliff.": "欢迎来到为那些糟糕的骰子日设计的书。挑战之书。地牢房间、谜题和陷阱》由几十个我们能想到的最聪明、最卑鄙的遭遇组成。这是一本 \"哦，伙计！\"、\"我不敢相信！\"和 \"你一定是在开玩笑！\"的书。是的，这些遭遇是按遭遇等级平衡的，是的，只要稍加思考，它们都可以解决。是的，我们甚至提供提示，你可以给你的玩家。但从根本上说，它们都是有点讨厌的。如果一个玩家宣布他要在这些遭遇中翻越悬崖，他就会翻越悬崖。",
	"Because sometimes, even we have one of those days.": "因为有时，即使是我们也有这样的日子。",
	"The Book of Challenges contains encounters you can plug into your favorite dungeon. Most are set against the backdrop of a \"typical\" dungeon, but with a little preparation, you can use them in any adventuring context. These encounters generally need very little introduction. In most of them, the PCs walk down a dungeon corridor and see what's in the room (or don't see it, depending on the amount of invisibility used). They resolve the challenge, lick their wounds, and then go on to some other part of the dungeon.": "挑战之书包含了你可以在你最喜欢的地下城中插入的遭遇。大多数是以 \"典型的 \"地牢为背景的，但只要稍加准备，你就可以在任何冒险环境中使用它们。这些遭遇战通常不需要什么介绍。在大多数情况下，NPC走到地牢的走廊上，看到房间里有什么东西（或者看不到，取决于使用的隐形程度）。他们解决了挑战，舔了舔伤口，然后继续去地牢的其他地方。",
	"The book is sorted by encounter level (EL). To choose an encounter for your players, figure out their characters' average party level. Pick an encounter with an EL that matches or comes close to that average.": "这本书是按遭遇等级（EL）排序的。要为你的玩家选择一个遭遇战，要弄清楚他们的角色的平均等级。挑选一个符合或接近该平均水平的遭遇战。",
	"Of course, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the capabilities of the items and creatures mentioned herein. In most cases, when an average creature is used, this book only shows the differences between the Monster Manual description and the description here. The book provides help in how to use these aspects of the encounters, but that doesn't substitute for research on your part.": "当然，你需要熟悉这里提到的物品和生物的能力。在大多数情况下，当使用一个普通的生物时，本书只显示了《怪物手册》描述和这里的描述之间的差异。本书提供了如何使用这些方面的遭遇的帮助，但这并不能代替你的研究。",
	"This book also contains many sidebars with tips for Dungeon Masters. You can use them to customize the encounters in your game or create similar types of encounters yourself. You'll find the legend for all the maps in this product on page 127.": "本书还包含许多侧边栏，为地下城主提供提示。你可以用它们来定制你游戏中的遭遇战，或者自己创造类似类型的遭遇战。你可以在第127页找到本产品中所有地图的图例。",
	"Most encounters have entries for \"Scaling the Challenge.\" These allow you to use the encounter at a higher or lower EL than the one given at the top of the entry. Even if your characters are all 10th level, you can use encounters at other ELs when you find these scaling sections. Don't forget to change the treasure awarded if you alter the encounter level. Treasure appropriate to an EL 5 encounter seems paltry for an EL 9 encounter, and far too rewarding for an EL 3 encounter.": "大多数奇遇都有 \"扩大挑战 \"的条目。这些条目允许你在比条目顶部给出的等级更高或更低的情况下使用该奇遇。即使你的角色都是10级，当你找到这些比例部分时，你也可以在其他等级上使用奇遇。如果你改变了奇遇的等级，别忘了改变授予的宝物。适合EL 5级遭遇战的宝物在EL 9级遭遇战中显得微不足道，而在EL 3级遭遇战中则奖励太丰厚。",
	"At any time, you can throw six orcs running down a 10-foot-wide corridor at your players' characters. That may be a good fight for some parties, but it's hardly clever. If the orcs suffer ranged weapon fire, not all of them will be able to reach the PCs' front line, and none of them will be able to reach the PCs' back line.": "在任何时候，你都可以把六个兽人从一个10英尺宽的走廊上扔给你的玩家的角色。这对某些党派来说可能是一场好的战斗，但这几乎是不聪明的。如果兽人遭受了远程武器的射击，那么他们并不是都能到达NPC的前线，也没有人能够到达NPC的后线。",
	"A clever encounter takes advantage of the mon sters' or NPCs' capabilities and tactics. Clever crea tures should spend a lot of time thinking about how they might survive an encounter with well-armed PCs. Six orcs parked behind nine-tenths cover with heavy crossbows, and a gaping pit in front of them now that might be a challenge. Four orcs in that situa tion, plus two on a ledge behind the PCs might be even better. Four orcs running from a rampaging hill giant. . . well, you get the idea.": "一个聪明的遭遇战可以利用怪物或NPC的能力和战术。聪明的创造者应该花很多时间来考虑他们如何在与装备精良的NPC的遭遇中生存。六个兽人停在十分之九的掩体后面，手持重弩，前面有一个缺口，这可能是一个挑战。四个兽人在这种情况下，加上两个在NPC后面的壁架上，可能会更好。四个兽人从一个横冲直撞的山丘巨人面前跑开。......好吧，你明白我的意思。",
	"Here are six general strategies for maximizing effectiveness of the monsters and NPCs you throw at your PCs.": "这里有六个一般策略，可以使你扔给你的NPC的怪物和NPC的效力最大化。",
	"{@bold Box Them In}: Most players think of fights in one direction, the one where they close to meet the com batants. PCs attacked from several sides are automat ically at a disadvantage, because they must choose where their area spells go, worry about being flanked, and separate to attack multiple foes.": "{@bold Box Them In}: 大多数玩家认为战斗只有一个方向，就是他们接近敌人的那个方向。从多个方向攻击的NPC会自动处于劣势，因为他们必须选择他们的区域法术的位置，担心被包抄，并且要分开攻击多个敌人。",
	"{@bold Split Them Up}: If you can separate the party members from each other, they won't be able to cooperate. Trap the scouts behind a barrier, drop the spellcasters through a trapdoor, or use nets and bull rushes to drag the PCs kicking and screaming away from each other. Get flying creatures into the air, so that flying PCs have to leave their friends to attack flying enemies with melee weapons. Be careful with this one, though. Splitting the party neutralizes the cooperative nature of the group, which won't be fun if it happens all the time.": "{@bold Split Them Up}: 如果你能把党员们彼此分开，他们就无法合作。把侦察兵困在障碍物后面，把施法者从活板门上扔下去，或者用网和公牛冲撞来把NPC踢来踢去地拖走。让飞行生物进入空中，这样，飞行的NPC就不得不离开他们的朋友，用近战武器攻击飞行的敌人。不过要注意这一点。分裂党派会中和团体的合作性质，如果经常发生这种情况，那就不好玩了。",
	"{@bold Show Them One Thing, Give Them Another}: A mid-level party seeing three iron golems coming at it will have a panic attack. But a hill giant sorcerer could easily cover two cronies and himself with illusions that make them appear as iron golems—and he may stop the PCs from casting spells on them, since the PCs will falsely believe they're useless against the \"constructs.\" Deception only needs to last a few rounds to be meaningful. A self-censoring party is a far less dangerous one.": "{@bold Show Them One Thing, Give Them Another}: 一支中级队伍看到三只铁甲虫向它走来，会感到惊慌失措。但是一个山丘巨人巫师可以很容易地用幻象掩护两个亲信和他自己，使他们看起来像铁甲虫--而且他可能会阻止NPC对他们施法，因为NPC会错误地认为他们对 \"建筑 \"毫无用处。欺骗只需要持续几个回合就有意义。一个自我审查的聚会是一个危险性小得多的聚会。",
	"{@bold Make Them Dig Deep}: In a lair of cold creatures, only the sorcerers will be able to muster enough fire spells to win. Using many of the same types of creatures drains a subset of the party's resources while never tapping into another subset. The heroes need to ration resources, and that benefits those on the receiving end of the PCs' wrath.": "{@bold Make Them Dig Deep}: 在冰冷生物的巢穴中，只有巫师能够调动足够的火系法术来取胜。使用许多相同类型的生物会耗尽一方的资源，但却无法利用另一个子集。英雄们需要配给资源，而这对那些接受NPC愤怒的人有利。",
	"{@bold Set Them Up, Knock Them Down}: Two creatures with compatible powers can combine to be much more effective. A wyvern's poison deals Constitution damage, and an achaierai's insanity requires a Fortitude save. If the achaierai attacks immediately after the wyvern drops a PC's Constitution into the single digits, that PC probably won't make his saving throw against the insanity. Two near-simultaneous attacks can mean one dead PC. For these sorts of battles, your monsters probably act on the same initiative number, though one can always delay a moment or two.": "{@bold Set Them Up, Knock Them Down}: 两种具有兼容能力的生物可以结合起来发挥更大的作用。狼人的毒药会造成体质伤害，而Achaierai的精神错乱则需进行毅力救赎。如果Achaierai在wyvern将PC的体质降至个位数后立即发动攻击，那么该PC可能不会对精神错乱进行蓄力。两次近乎同时的攻击可能意味着一个人的死亡。对于这类战斗，你的怪物可能会在相同的主动权数字上行动，尽管其中一个总是可以延迟一两个小时。",
	"{@bold Hang Them if They Can't Take a Joke}: Make sure you have a way out for any creature that wants to get away. A flying creature fighting at the edge of a cliff has a much better chance to get away than one in a closed room. The PCs still get the experience, but they lose any treasure the escaping NPCs are carrying. That alone gets the heroes to be more strategic in the future.": "{@bold Hang Them if They Can't Take a Joke}: 确保你有办法让任何想逃跑的生物离开。在悬崖边战斗的飞行生物比在封闭的房间里的飞行生物有更好的机会逃跑。NPC仍然可以得到经验，但他们会失去逃跑的NPC所携带的任何宝物。仅仅这一点就能让英雄们在未来变得更有战略眼光。",
	"Many DMs are wary of making puzzles. Others are too comfortable making them, sometimes without realizing the complexity some puzzles require. To find the right level of comfort, identify a puzzle type you can create and then practice until you create a memorable one.": "许多管理员对制作谜题持谨慎态度。还有一些人在制作谜题时过于自如，有时没有意识到一些谜题需要的复杂性。为了找到合适的舒适度，确定一个你可以制作的谜题类型，然后进行练习，直到你制作出一个令人难忘的谜题。",
	"To set up a puzzle, figure out what you want it to do. Do you want to deliver a message, provide a clue to a mystery, or make solving the puzzle the only way out of a deathtrap? When you have figured that out, pick a puzzle type. Several puzzles in this book come with sidebars on how to make others like them. Mazes, letter-addition puzzles, and codes all have simple principles you can follow. Of course, these sidebars can't provide the cleverness you'll need to challenge your players.": "要设置一个谜题，要弄清楚你希望它做什么。你是想传递一个信息，提供一个神秘的线索，还是让解开谜题成为摆脱死亡陷阱的唯一途径？当你想通了这一点，就可以选择一个谜题类型。本书中的几个谜题都有关于如何制作其他类似谜题的侧记。迷宫、字母加法谜题和密码都有简单的原则，你可以遵循。当然，这些边栏并不能提供你所需要的聪明才智来挑战你的玩家。",
	"Then try making the puzzle. Use the strategies herein, and keep trying them until you conclude that you would like to solve the puzzle if another DM presented it to you.": "然后尝试制作这个谜题。使用这里的策略，并不断尝试，直到你得出结论，如果另一个DM向你展示这个谜题，你会想去解开它。",
	"Try to personalize your puzzles. They need to make sense in the world your PCs inhabit. Don't give them a puzzle about rock music or cars, because the PCs have never heard of either. Instead, use references to NPCs, cities in your world, or monsters the PCs might face.": "试着使你的谜题个性化。它们需要在你的PC居住的世界里有意义。不要给他们一个关于摇滚音乐或汽车的谜题，因为他们从来没有听说过这两种东西。相反，可以参考NPC、你的世界中的城市、或者NPC可能面临的怪物。",
	"Before you give your puzzles to the PCs, write a list of hints. These should usually be rewards for making successful skill checks. A puzzle about magic items could require a Knowledge (arcana) check, for instance. In all cases, a simple Intelligence check should give a hint of what type of puzzle the PCs face. You can also devise hints that require spells or class features, such as letting a cleric use his turn undead ability to open a magically locked chest bearing the visage of a ghoul.": "在你把谜题交给NPC之前，写一个提示清单。这些提示通常应该是对成功进行技能检查的奖励。例如，一个关于魔法物品的谜题可能需要进行知识（奥术）检查。在所有的情况下，简单的智力检查就可以提示NPC面临的谜题的类型。你也可以设计一些需要法术或等级特征的提示，比如让一个牧师使用他的转化不死生物的能力来打开一个被魔法锁住的带有食尸鬼面孔的箱子。",
	"When the PCs solve a puzzle, reward them. Just solving a puzzle makes them feel smart, but solving a puzzle that hands them a magic item or opens a secret door makes them feel smart and accomplished.": "当NPC解决了一个谜题时，奖励他们。仅仅解决一个谜题就能让他们感到自己很聪明，但是解决了一个能给他们带来魔法物品或打开秘密之门的谜题，会让他们感到自己很聪明，很有成就感。",
	"When the characters fall prey to a trap, they're usually unprepared, unwary, or outclassed. Players take great pride in getting past traps, because they think that means they're smarter than the makers of the dungeon. Conversely, they feel great shame when they walk right into the trap.": "当角色成为陷阱的猎物时，他们通常是没有准备，没有警惕性，或者是能力不足。玩家为能通过陷阱而感到非常自豪，因为他们认为这意味着他们比地牢的制造者更聪明。反之，当他们直接走进陷阱时，他们会感到非常羞耻。",
	"To see all the parts of a great dungeon trap, look to a real-world example: the mousetrap. A mousetrap has three parts: the bait, the trigger, and the illusion of safety. The mouse is attracted by the bait (some cheese), trips the trigger (a pressure-sensitive neck-breaker), and is stunned when it happens (since the neck-breaker seems far removed from the cheese). Although your PCs are (hopefully) a bit smarter than mice, the same principles apply.": "要看到一个伟大的地牢陷阱的所有部分，请看一个现实世界的例子：捕鼠器。捕鼠器有三个部分：诱饵、触发器和安全的假象。老鼠被诱饵（一些奶酪）吸引，触发器（一个压力敏感的断颈器），并在发生时被击晕（因为断颈器似乎离奶酪很远）。虽然你的电脑（希望）比老鼠聪明一点，但同样的原则也适用。",
	"The bait should always be something the PCs want. Before you flip to the treasure chapter in the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide, think a little deeper about what they really want. They want experience. They want to conserve their resources. Most importantly, they want to feel comfortable breaking into something's lair and killing it. These characters are easy to motivate, because simply presenting a door plays into the PCs' expectation that they can walk unimpeded through a dangerous area.": "诱饵应该始终是NPC想要的东西。在你翻开《DUNGEON MASTER'S GUIDE》中的宝藏一章之前，先深入思考一下他们真正想要什么。他们想要经验。他们想节约资源。最重要的是，他们希望能够自如地闯入某个东西的巢穴并将其杀死。这些角色很容易被激励，因为简单地提出一扇门，就能满足NPC的期望，即他们可以不受阻碍地走过一个危险的区域。",
	"The trap's trigger can be magical, mechanical, or both. Almost any spell or device can become a trap if given some thought. Even the ultra-benign raise dead spell can trigger the revival of something the PCs want to stay dead. If your PCs can shrug off the damage from a crossbow trap, set up a ballista trap. The best triggers are ones that create some amusing, embarrassing, or otherwise memorable victimization, such as a hidden catapult that propels a PC into a freezing cold river. The illusion of safety is the most important element. A trap should go off when the PCs are comfortable with their situation. A rickety bridge spanning a crevasse does not appear safe, but a door on which the PCs have already disabled a trap with a low Search DC does. Put them on guard when their guard is down, and knock them off guard when their guard is up.": "陷阱的触发器可以是魔法的，也可以是机械的，或者两者都是。几乎所有的法术或设备都可以成为陷阱，只要稍加考虑。即使是极其温和的起死回生法术，也可以触发那些NPC希望保持死亡的东西的复活。如果你的NPC能够摆脱弩箭陷阱的伤害，那就设置一个弹弓陷阱。最好的触发器是那些能创造出一些有趣的、令人尴尬的或其他令人难忘的受害情况的触发器，比如一个隐藏的弹射器将PC推进了一条冰冷的河流。安全的假象是最重要的因素。陷阱应该在PC对自己的处境感到满意时启动。一座横跨裂缝的摇摇欲坠的桥看起来并不安全，但是一扇NPC已经用低搜索DC解除了陷阱的门就安全了。在他们放松警惕的时候让他们提高警惕，在他们提高警惕的时候让他们失去警惕。",
	"For more on the making of traps, see Chapter 4 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide and the supplement, Song and Silence: A Guidebook to Bards and Rogues.": "关于制作陷阱的更多信息，请参见《地下城主指南》第4章和补充材料《歌声与沉默》。吟游诗人和罗杰斯指南》。",
	"This book requires significant adaptability on the players' part. A key component of that is their spell selection. Walking into these atypical environs armed with nothing but fireballs and lightning bolts may make for frequent trips to the local purveyor of raise dead spells.": "本书要求玩家有显著的适应性。其中一个关键部分是他们的法术选择。在这些非典型的环境中，除了火球和闪电之外，什么都没有，这可能会使他们经常去找当地的起死回生法术的供应商。",
	"Whether prepared or set into magic items, the spells that follow are must-haves for dealing with the brain-bending challenges in this book. You shouldn't be disappointed when players use these spells to thwart the challenges herein. Instead, you should take magnanimous pride that your players are sharp enough to use resources so efficiently.": "无论是准备好的还是镶嵌在魔法物品中的，下面的法术都是应对本书中令人脑洞大开的挑战的必备之物。当玩家使用这些法术来挫败这里的挑战时，你不应该感到失望。相反，你应该感到宽宏大量的自豪，因为你的玩家足够敏锐，能够如此有效地利用资源。",
	"Clairaudience/{@spell Clairvoyance}: Forewarned is forearmed, and this is one of the best ways in the game to be forewarned. At higher levels, players should consider foresight, scrying, and true seeing to get results that are even more reliable. Augury can be helpful, but players may not be willing to risk the spell's chance of failure in a life-or-death situation. (A bat familiar's blindsight ability has a similar effect, but a player who sends his leather-winged pal into every room may soon be looking for a new familiar.)": "千里眼/{@spell Clairvoyance}。前车之鉴，这是游戏中最好的预警方式之一。在更高的级别上，玩家应该考虑预知、窥探和真视来获得更可靠的结果。预言术可能会有帮助，但玩家可能不愿意在生死攸关的情况下冒险使用该法术的失败机会。(蝙蝠伙伴的盲视能力也有类似的效果，但如果玩家把他的皮翼伙伴送进每个房间，可能很快就会寻找新的伙伴了）。",
	"Detect Magic: Many of these challenges involve unexpected uses of magic. Knowing where the magic is can help characters immensely. Spellcasters should always press for more information about the number, location, schools, and strengths of the auras they detect, allowing for educated guesses about what's there.": "探测魔法：许多挑战涉及魔法的意外使用。知道魔法在哪里可以极大地帮助角色。施法者应该经常要求提供更多关于他们所探测到的光环的数量、位置、流派和强度的信息，以便对那里的东西进行有根据的猜测。",
	"{@spell Dispel Magic}: Once the characters know magic is there, their spellcasters should consider blowing it away, at least for a time. In some cases where there are many magical effects, this can require a lot of dispel checks, some of which will certainly fail. Again, detect magic helps here. At higher levels, greater dispelling, globe of invulnerability, and antimagic field can be used to a similar effect. Mordenkainen's disjunction is also a good choice, but it is often an overreaction.": "{@spell Dispel Magic}: 一旦人物知道有魔法存在，他们的施法者就应该考虑把它吹走，至少在一段时间内。在一些有许多魔法效果的情况下，这可能需要大量的驱散检查，其中一些肯定会失败。同样，探测魔法在这里也有帮助。在更高的级别，更强的驱散能力、无敌之球和反魔法领域也可以达到类似的效果。Mordenkainen的disjunction也是一个不错的选择，但它往往是一种过度反应。",
	"{@spell Fly}: In some cases (but definitely not all), the physical barriers in these encounters can be skirted by flying. The impressive speed and versatility of flight allows characters to meet challenges in three dimensions rather than two, something their opponents may not be able to address. If characters don't have access to this spell, levitate, jump, spider climb, and feather fall are highly recommended.": "{@spell Fly}: 在某些情况下（但绝对不是全部），这些遭遇中的物理障碍可以通过飞行来绕开。飞行的惊人速度和多功能性使角色能够在三维空间而不是二维空间中迎接挑战，这是对手可能无法解决的。如果角色不能使用这个法术，强烈建议使用悬浮术、跳跃术、蜘蛛爬行术和羽落术。",
	"{@spell Freedom of Movement}: Many challenges in here impede the characters' ability to move freely. Being able to fight normally underwater, in webs, or in other difficult surroundings counters the natural advantages of the creatures and traps in these encounters.": "{@spell Freedom of Movement}: 这里的许多挑战阻碍了人物的自由行动能力。能够在水下、网中或其他困难的环境中正常作战，可以抵消这些遭遇中的生物和陷阱的自然优势。",
	"Gaseous Form: Most challenges in this book are physical. When the characters simply wish to bypass them, becoming less physical certainly helps. This spell and the more powerful wind walk are even more effective in these cases than polymorph self and polymorph other. After all, changing into a bird won't give a PC damage reduction 20/+1 and the ability to seep through cracks in walls.": "气态的形式。本书中的大多数挑战都是物理挑战。当角色只是想绕过它们时，变得不那么有形当然有帮助。在这种情况下，这个咒语和更强大的风行术甚至比多态自体和多态他体更有效。毕竟，变成一只鸟不会给个人带来伤害减免20/+1和渗入墙壁缝隙的能力。",
	"{@spell Invisibility}: The challenges involving creatures are less effective if the creatures can't find the characters. Invisibility and its more powerful associated spells often can stop these encounters before the creatures get started. Of course, some creatures in here can see invisible characters, a fact those creatures might not reveal immediately.": "{@spell Invisibility}: 如果生物找不到角色，涉及生物的挑战就不那么有效。隐身术和其更强大的相关法术往往可以在生物开始之前阻止这些遭遇战。当然，这里的一些生物可以看到隐形的角色，而这些生物可能不会立即暴露这一事实。",
	"{@spell Mage Hand}: This spell has two purposes here. The first is jostling small objects and traps. The second is discovering when this isn't possible, since mage hand moves only unattended objects of 5 pounds or less. Thus, if mage hand can't move a small object, the caster knows the object is not what it seems. Telekinesis and unseen servant do this more effectively, as can summoning a creature that can understand the caster and thus do more than simply attack.": "{@spell Mage Hand}: 这个法术在这里有两个目的。第一个是推搡小物体和陷阱。第二是发现这不可能，因为法师之手只移动5磅或以下的无人看管的物体。因此，如果法师之手不能移动一个小物体，施法者就知道这个物体不是它看起来的那样。心灵感应和看不见的仆人能更有效地做到这一点，就像召唤一个能理解施法者的生物，从而做得比简单的攻击更多。",
	"{@spell Magic Missile}: Though this spell does less damage than either fireball or a barbarian with a double-axe, energy spells and melee attacks are often thwarted in these encounters by environmental factors like water, resistances, and barriers. Magic missile strikes unerringly, even around most types of cover and concealment.": "{@spell Magic Missile}: 虽然这个法术的伤害低于火球术或手持双斧的野蛮人，但在这些遭遇战中，能量法术和近战攻击经常被环境因素如水、抵抗力和障碍物所阻挠。魔法飞弹能准确无误地攻击，甚至在大多数类型的掩护和隐蔽物周围。",
	"{@spell Teleport}: When all else fails, flee. Teleport, dimension door, word of recall, phase door, and similar spells make this tactic a lot easier on a moment's notice.": "{@spell Teleport}: 当所有其他方法都失败时，就逃吧。瞬移、维度门、回忆之语、相位门和类似的法术使这种战术在一瞬间变得容易得多。",
	"Other good spell choices include arcane lock, break enchantment, daylight, detect snares and pits, detect thoughts, disintegrate, displacement, endure elements, find traps, find the path, ghost sound, guidance, hold portal, invisibility purge, knock, light, message, project image, protection from elements, quench, repulsion, resist elements, see invisibility, shatter, silence, slow, stone tell, water breathing, wood shape—and, of course, raise dead.": "其他好的法术选择包括：奥术锁、破除魔法、日光、探测陷阱和坑洞、探测思想、瓦解、位移、忍受元素、寻找陷阱、寻找路径、鬼音、引导、保持门户、隐形净化、敲击、光、信息、投射影像、保护元素、淬火、击退、抵抗元素、看到隐形、粉碎、沉默、缓慢、石头告诉、水呼吸、木形，当然还有复活死者。",
	"Multiple traps of the same type do not necessarily have the same additive effect on Encounter Levels that multiple monsters of the same type do. If you have a trap of a certain CR, adding another such trap nearby raises the EL by 1. Adding any greater number of such traps may raise the EL by an additional 1, but might not even do that. This is because a single solution that can beat one trap can usually beat any number of similar traps.": "同一类型的多个陷阱对遭遇等级的影响不一定与同一类型的多个怪物的影响相同。如果你有一个特定CR的陷阱，在附近再增加一个这样的陷阱会使EL提高1。这是因为一个能打败一个陷阱的方案通常能打败任何数量的类似陷阱。",
	"For example, imagine a long line of pit traps. If the PCs use fly spells to get over the first one, they can use the same spells to get over the rest of them. Thus, the additional traps don't really represent an additional challenge, nor do they represent an additional drain on the PCs' resources.": "例如，想象一下一长串的坑道陷阱。如果NPC使用飞行法术越过第一个陷阱，他们可以使用同样的法术越过其余的陷阱。因此，额外的陷阱并不真正代表额外的挑战，也不代表对NPC资源的额外消耗。",
	"In this book, when multiple traps appear side by side, they are given a CR rating for each individual trap, then one for the entire group. This gives you the maximum XP the party gets for dealing with that group of traps.": "在本书中，当多个陷阱并排出现时，会给每个单独的陷阱一个CR等级，然后给整个组一个CR等级。这就给你提供了党派处理该组陷阱的最大XP。",
	"Throughout the Book of Challenges, we have provided numerous encounters designed to stretch not only the capabilities of the players and their characters, but those of the monsters as well. The Monster Manual has specific rules for making monsters tougher by raising their Hit Dice, while the Player's Handbook and DUNGEON MASTER's Guide provide tools for adding character levels to monsters and adding traps to their lairs.": "在整个《挑战之书》中，我们提供了许多旨在扩展玩家及其角色能力的遭遇战，也包括那些怪物的能力。怪物手册》中有具体的规则，可以通过提高怪物的命中率来使其变得更强硬，而《玩家手册》和《DUNGEON MASTER指南》则提供了为怪物增加角色等级和为其巢穴增加陷阱的工具。",
	"For a change of pace, a DM may want to scale a monster down, making it weaker. The possible reasons for scaling down an encounter are numerous. So are the ways to do it.": "为了改变节奏，管理员可能想缩小一个怪物的规模，使其变得更弱。缩小遭遇战规模的可能原因很多。做到这一点的方法也有很多。",
	"The most complicated way to scale down a creature is by reversing the process for scaling it up. Removing Hit Dice removes skills and combat abilities. It may reduce the effectiveness of spell-like abilities or even the number of spells a creature can cast per day. Reducing a creature's size (say, from Large to Medium-size), not only lowers its physical ability scores, but could provide an interesting story angle as well (for instance, a runt minotaur hoping to win the respect of his peers).": "缩小一个生物规模的最复杂的方法是颠倒扩大规模的过程。移除命中率会移除技能和战斗能力。它可能会降低法术类能力的效力，甚至降低一个生物每天可以施放的法术数量。减少一个生物的体型（比如说，从大型到中型），不仅会降低它的物理能力分数，而且还可以提供一个有趣的故事角度（例如，一个矮小的牛头人希望赢得他的同伴的尊重）。",
	"Hampering monsters the same way a DM hampers characters can be less work for the same reward. Perhaps an ettin has lost his greatclubs or a titan no longer has his warhammer. Creatures with limited use abilities, such as the gorgon or the manticore, may have already used some or all of them for the day. This tactic works as long as the players can be made aware of the limitation. Maybe an ogre mage used his cone of cold earlier that day to kill an owlbear. If the players find a partially frozen owlbear corpse, they have a chance to figure out their nemesis is not up to full strength.": "阻碍怪物，就像DM阻碍角色一样，可以减少工作量，获得同样的回报。也许一个艾丁失去了他的大棒，或者一个泰坦不再拥有他的战锤。具有有限使用能力的生物，如戈尔贡或曼提柯尔，可能已经在当天使用了部分或全部能力。只要能让玩家意识到这种限制，这种战术就能奏效。也许一个食人魔法师在当天早些时候用他的寒冰锥杀死了一只猫头鹰熊。如果玩家发现了一具部分冰冻的猫头鹰熊的尸体，他们就有机会发现他们的克星没有达到全盛状态。",
	"As an alternative, consider putting a powerful creature in an environment that's hostile to it, or simply inconvenient. Perhaps a kuo-toa took a wrong turn getting back to the pool and ended up in the courtyard of an abandoned castle. With the sun coming up soon, the adventurers can wait in the stables for the right moment to strike. If the griffon the party is running from is foolish enough to follow them into a thick grove of trees, its maneuverability is drastically cut down. The same way you play up a creature's intelligence to make it tougher, playing up a creature's stupidity can help even the odds. Even smart monsters can make bad decisions.": "作为一个替代方案，考虑把一个强大的生物放在一个对它有敌意的环境中，或者仅仅是不方便。也许一个国土人在回水池的路上走错了路，最后来到了一个废弃的城堡的院子里。太阳快出来了，冒险家们可以在马厩里等待合适的时机出击。如果一行人要躲避的狮鹫愚蠢到跟着他们进入一片茂密的树林，它的机动性就会被大幅削减。就像你提高一个生物的智力以使其更加坚韧一样，提高一个生物的愚蠢程度也可以帮助平衡胜负。即使是聪明的怪兽也会做出错误的决定。",
	"The Hill Giant Madness encounter demonstrates another equalizer: ability loss from disease. Using cursed items can further offset a creature's powers, as it did for Motty. Creatures can even have permanent spell effects on them from previous adventures, such as blindness or bestow curse.": "山丘巨人的疯狂遭遇展示了另一个平衡器：疾病带来的能力损失。使用被诅咒的物品可以进一步抵消一个生物的能力，就像对莫蒂那样。生物甚至可以从以前的冒险中获得永久的法术效果，例如失明或赐予诅咒。",
	"At the lower end of desirability, but still acceptable in certain situations, is simply knocking down hit points. Consider a mimic that hasn't had time to fully heal after its last encounter with a group of goblins.": "在可取性的低端，但在某些情况下仍然可以接受，就是简单地打掉命中率。想想看，一个模仿者在上次遇到一群地精后，还没有时间完全愈合。",
	"Like most of the tricks in this book, scaled-down monsters should be used sparingly. You should never introduce a new monster type as a weakened version. Using scaled-down monsters may make the players unimpressed, unprepared, or reckless when they meet the normal version. Even if they have seen the monster before, they may feel cheated if they run into weakened monster after weakened monster.": "就像本书中的大多数技巧一样，按比例缩小的怪兽应该少用。你不应该把一个新的怪物类型作为弱化版来介绍。当玩家遇到正常版本的怪物时，使用缩小版的怪物可能会让他们印象不深，没有准备，或者鲁莽行事。即使他们以前见过这种怪物，如果他们碰到一个又一个的削弱版怪物，他们也会感到被欺骗。",
	"Scaling down the CRs is an inexact science at best, and that may lead to more complications when assigning experience points. Used judiciously, however, it offers more opportunities for cleverly designed encounters.": "缩小CR的规模充其量是一门不精确的科学，这可能导致在分配经验值时出现更多的复杂情况。然而，明智地使用，它为设计巧妙的遭遇战提供了更多的机会。",
	"A 50% increase in Hit Dice increases a monster's CR by 1. Doubling the HD of a monster increases the CR by 2. Tripling HD should increase CR by 3 or 4; however, you'll still need to evaluate the resulting creature to decide which value is more appropriate. These two creatures provide good examples of monster advancement.": "命中率增加50%，怪物的CR就会增加1；怪物的HD增加一倍，CR就会增加2；HD增加两倍，CR就会增加3或4；但是，你仍然需要评估产生的生物，以决定哪一个数值更合适。这两种生物提供了怪物进阶的好例子。",
	"The xorn began as a simple CR 8, 15-HD monster from the Monster Manual. Applying the monster advancement rules gave it good hit points (15d8), a great attack bonus (as fighter), and three good saves, making it significantly tougher as well. The extra feats are incredibly handy. The extra skill points don't mean much in this encounter. This merits a CR 2 increase, so it's now CR 10. Tripling it would probably result in an increase of 4, to CR 12.": "Xorn开始时是一个简单的CR8，15-HD的怪物，来自《怪物手册》。应用怪物进阶规则给了它很好的命中率（15d8），一个很好的攻击加成（作为战士），以及三个很好的救赎，使它也变得非常强悍。额外的功法是非常方便的。额外的技能点在这场战斗中并不意味着什么。这值得增加CR 2，所以它现在是CR 10。三倍可能会导致增加4，即CR 12。",
	"The gray render in the Monster Manual starts out as a CR 8, 10-HD monster. We applied the monster advancement rules to advance it to 30 HD. This tripled the number of Hit Dice. The creature focuses on simple melee. It gained great hit points (20d10), a decent attack bonus (as cleric), and two good saves, making it significantly tougher. The low number of skill points doesn't matter to the render. Looking at the finished monster, it seems to merit a CR 3 increase, so it's now CR ": "怪物手册中的灰色效果图开始时是一个CR8，10-HD的怪物。我们应用怪物进阶规则将其提升至30HD。这使得它的命中率提高了三倍。该怪物专注于简单的近战。它获得了巨大的命中率（20d10），一个体面的攻击加成（作为牧师），以及两个良好的救赎，使它明显变得强硬。低数量的技能点对渲染来说并不重要。看一下完成的怪物，它似乎值得增加CR 3，所以它现在的CR",
	"One of the most overlooked directions in the typical DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® campaign is, well, any one other than horizontal. Characters walk the halls of dungeons and run around the courtyards of castles, while players move miniatures around a flat surface (usually a tabletop). Players (and even DMs) often forget that challenges can come from any direction, not just from down the hallway to the left or the 10-foot-deep pit trap up ahead. Some monsters fly, and some characters respond by using magic to fly as well. Despite this, most encounters in the course of an evening's adventures take place in two dimensions.": "在典型的DUNGEONS & DRAGONS®战役中，最被忽视的方向之一是，嗯，除了水平方向以外的任何方向。角色在地下城的大厅里行走，在城堡的庭院里奔跑，而玩家则在一个平面上（通常是桌面）移动微型模型。玩家（甚至是管理员）经常忘记，挑战可能来自任何方向，而不仅仅是来自左边的走廊或前方10英尺深的坑道陷阱。有些怪物会飞，有些角色也会通过使用魔法飞行来应对。尽管如此，在一个晚上的冒险过程中，大多数遭遇都是在两个维度上发生的。",
	"The common pit trap is the only vertical encounter that's likely to appear in every campaign or adventure. While pit traps are an annoyance for an adventuring party of nearly any level, after the second or third encounter with one, the average player simply rolls his eyes and searches his character sheet for rope to pull out his clumsy companion. One solution to this tedium is adding spice to the pit traps themselves. Spikes added at the bottom, secret doors leading to secret rooms, and deadly water traps are just a few ways to make pits more memorable.": "常见的坑道陷阱是唯一可能出现在每个战役或冒险中的垂直遭遇。虽然坑道陷阱对于几乎任何级别的冒险队伍来说都是一种烦恼，但在第二次或第三次遇到坑道陷阱之后，一般的玩家只会翻白眼，在他的角色表上寻找绳子来拉出他笨拙的同伴。解决这种乏味的方法之一是为坑道陷阱本身添加调味品。底部的钉子、通往秘密房间的秘密门和致命的水陷阱只是使坑洞更令人难忘的几种方法。",
	"Solutions also exist outside the box, so to speak. Several of the encounters in this book make use of different kinds of vertical space. While a creative Dungeon Master can expand on those encounters, many general ideas can help the DM who wishes to design her own adventure.": "可以说，解决方案也存在于盒子之外。本书中的一些遭遇战利用了不同种类的垂直空间。虽然有创意的地下城主可以对这些遭遇进行扩展，但许多一般性的想法可以帮助那些希望设计自己的冒险的管理员。",
	"The simplest solution is reversing the usual. For example, instead of pit traps, why not ceiling traps? Watch the fun the first time the ceiling opens up and rocks fall on your heroes. Ceiling traps can be deadly (the classic splash of hot oil), or just annoying (the not-so-classic flood of warm molasses). Having hidden doors in the ceiling allows monsters to hide above the characters, dropping down on them when the time is right. For creatures without the ability to fly, try adding balconies, or have creatures hide on the ceilings of high caverns.": "最简单的解决方案是颠覆常规。例如，与其说是坑洞陷阱，不如说是天花板陷阱。当天花板第一次打开，石块落在你的英雄身上时，你会发现很有趣。天花板陷阱可以是致命的（经典的热油飞溅），也可以是恼人的（不那么经典的温热糖浆的洪水）。在天花板上设置隐蔽的门，可以让怪物躲在人物的上方，在时机成熟时向他们投下。对于没有飞行能力的生物，可以尝试增加阳台，或者让生物躲在高高的洞穴的天花板上。",
	"Even in your imaginary setting, the sun rises into the sky and the water flows downhill. Don't forget to include \"up\" and \"down\" in your encounters as well.": "即使在你想象的环境中，太阳也会升入天空，水会流向山下。不要忘记在你的遭遇中也包括 \"向上 \"和 \"向下\"。",
	"PCs who know a trap's location and effect—such as many of the already triggered traps in this encounter should find it easier to avoid or disable them. When characters approach such a trap, consider lowering the DC on the perception checks to find them, skill checks for Thieves' Tools checks to disarm them, and Dexterity saves to avoid them": "知道陷阱的位置和效果的人--比如这次遭遇中的许多已经触发的陷阱--应该会发现更容易避免或解除它们。当人物接近这样的陷阱时，可以考虑降低发现它们的感知检查的DC，降低解除它们的盗贼工具检查的技能检查，以及降低避免它们的灵巧救赎。",
	"Spread effects, such as fireballs, can reach around most forms of cover. As long as the spread effect can reach your position, you can't claim better than one-half cover from the effect (+2 cover bonus for AC and Dexterity saving throw).

	"Familiars often make excellent scouts, especially if they can fly. They can zip ahead of a party, take a quick look around, and instantly relay what they discover through empathic links with their masters. That option can be a real boon to a party eager to determine what lies ahead, but it can be a real headache for a DM who has to relay the information, especially if a familiar ruins a well-laid ambush. Fortunately, DMs have ways to keep familiars from spoiling everything.": "家族成员通常是优秀的侦察员，特别是如果他们能飞的话。它们可以在队伍的前面飞奔，快速查看周围的情况，并通过与主人的共鸣联系立即转达它们的发现。对于急于确定前方情况的队伍来说，这种选择可能是一个真正的福音，但对于必须转达信息的管理员来说，这可能是一个非常令人头痛的问题，特别是如果一个熟悉的人破坏了一个精心布置的伏击。幸运的是，DM有办法让家族成员不破坏一切。",
	"First, keep in mind that most creatures a familiar would encounter on a scouting mission are hostile or ornery enough to attack a roving familiar out of sheer meanness. For example, the mephits in the Fire and Water encounter may very well pursue and harass any lone familiar they happen to see. They might chase it around for the sheer fun of it, catch it and tie an old shoe to its tail, lob a magic missile spell at it, or even burn it alive in their magma pool. Which option you choose should depend on how frequently and aggressively the players use the familiar.": "首先，请记住，一个熟悉的人在侦查任务中遇到的大多数生物都是有敌意的，或者是足以攻击一个游荡的熟悉的人，因为他们纯粹是卑鄙的。例如，在 \"水与火 \"的遭遇中，Mephits很可能会追击和骚扰它们碰巧看到的任何一个孤独的熟悉的人。他们可能会为了纯粹的乐趣而追赶它，抓住它并把一只旧鞋绑在它的尾巴上，向它施放魔法导弹，甚至在他们的岩浆池里把它活活烧死。你选择哪种方案，应该取决于玩家使用这个熟悉的东西的频率和力度。",
	"Less capricious creatures might have more subtle responses. For example, the will-o-wisps in the Lightin the Dark encounter may simply pretend they don'tnotice a scouting familiar. After it leaves, theybecome invisible and lie in wait for the party. In such situations, the familiar's information is likely to be inaccurate; it saw lights but no live creatures.": "不那么任性的生物可能有更微妙的反应。例如，在 \"黑暗之光 \"的奇遇中，\"巫师 \"可能只是假装没有注意到一个侦察员。在它离开之后，它们就会隐身，并埋伏在那里等着队伍。在这种情况下，熟悉者的信息很可能是不准确的；它看到了灯光，但没有看到活的生物。",
	"Fortunately, most familiars have a reasonable sense of self-preservation and a good dose of common sense (even if their masters don't). Without any prompting from the master, a familiar is apt to avoid moving around in plain sight. Instead, it may look for places to hide, pausing to sniff the air and listen for danger before entering a chamber, or even rounding a corner. These precautions slow the familiar's progress, limiting the quality of information it can relay back to its master.": "幸运的是，大多数家臣都有合理的自我保护意识和良好的常识（即使他们的主人不知道）。如果没有主人的任何提示，熟悉的人很可能会避免在众目睽睽之下走动。相反，它可能会寻找藏身之处，在进入一个密室或甚至绕过一个角落之前，暂停嗅闻空气，倾听危险。这些预防措施减缓了熟悉的人的进展，限制了它能向主人传递的信息的质量。",
	"Once a familiar locates a creature, it's apt to take the better part of valor and withdraw before it can be spotted. Of course, the familiar's master can order it to take a few risks, but eventually, the familiar's luck runs out. The master is then rewarded with a slain familiar and the accompanying loss of experience points.": "一旦一个熟悉的人找到了一个生物，它就会采取更好的勇气，在它被发现之前撤退。当然，熟悉的人的主人可以命令它冒一些风险，但最终，熟悉的人的运气会耗尽。这时，主人就会得到一个被杀的熟悉者的奖励，并伴随着经验值的损失。",

	"An incorporeal creature also has the advantage of mobility. Almost nothing can impede its movement. In addition, incorporeal creatures ignore armor, natural armor bonuses, and cover bonuses, though force effects, such as mage armor, shield, and wall of force, work normally with respect to incorporeal creatures.": "无实体的生物也有流动性的优势。几乎没有什么可以阻碍它的行动。此外，无体生物无视护甲、自然护甲加成和掩护加成，尽管力的效果，如法师护甲、盾牌和力墙，对无体生物正常工作。",
	"Incorporeal creatures can freely move through solid objects. It's important to remember, though, that being incorporeal doesn't allow a creature to see through solid objects. For example, the spectres in this encounter can hide in floors, ceilings, columns, or quicksand, but they can't see through them. While waiting in ambush inside a solid object, an incorporeal creature must listen for foes or periodically stick out its head for a look around. Solid objects tend to carry sound very well, so you may wish to adjust the creature's DC for a perception checks holding their ear to the ground/wall. The usual modifiers for distance apply. An incorporeal creature can try to pinpoint an opponent from inside a solid object; this uses the same rules as pinpointing invisible opponents": "无实体的生物可以在固体物体中自由移动。不过，重要的是要记住，无体生物并不允许生物看穿固体物体。例如，这次遭遇中的幽灵可以躲在地板、天花板、柱子或流沙中，但他们不能看穿它们。当埋伏在固体物体中时，无实体的生物必须倾听敌人的声音，或者定期伸出头来看看周围。固体物体往往能很好地传递声音，所以你可能希望调整生物的感知检查DC，让它们的耳朵贴着地面/墙壁。通常的距离修饰法也适用。无实体的生物可以尝试从实体物体中定位对手；这与定位隐形对手的规则相同。",
	"Even so, the incorporeal creature can get only a vague idea of an opponent's location by listening, so it must occasionally stick its head out for a look around. A good way to simulate this is by picking a spot at the edge of the object in which it hides that is somewhere within a half move of its position at the end of its turn. During the creature's next turn, assume it moves to that spot first, no matter where the creature's opponents are. Once the creature looks around, it can finish its action and perhaps attack a foe it can reach with its remaining move.": "即便如此，无体生物也只能通过听来模糊地了解对手的位置，所以它必须偶尔把头伸出来看看周围。模拟这种情况的一个好方法是，在它所躲藏的物体边缘选取一个位置，该位置在它回合结束时距离它的位置半步之内。在该生物的下一回合中，假设它首先移动到该点，无论该生物的对手在哪里。一旦该生物环顾四周，它就可以完成它的行动，也许可以用它剩余的动作来攻击它可以到达的敌人。",
	"Incorporeal creatures that can fly can move through solid objects at their flying speeds, but they must observe their maneuverability limitations when doing so. For example, a spectre can fly at a speed of 80 feet (even though walls), but it has only good maneuverability, so it's limited to 90-degree turns. It has to expend 5 feet of movement to turn in place or reverse direction while flying (see Tactical Aerial Movement in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide).": "能飞的无体生物可以以它们的飞行速度穿过固体物体，但它们在这样做时必须遵守它们的机动性限制。例如，一个幽灵可以以80英尺的速度飞行（即使是墙壁），但它只有良好的机动性，所以它被限制在90度的转弯。它必须消耗5英尺的移动距离才能在飞行时原地转弯或扭转方向（参见《地下城主指南》第三章的战术空中移动）。",
	"This puzzle provides a trick where the players must realize that a word can become another word when a letter is added (CURE + S = CURSE).": "这道谜题提供了一个技巧，玩家必须意识到当一个单词加上一个字母后可以变成另一个单词（CURE + S = CURSE）。",
	"A letter can be added to or subtracted from a word to make an entirely different word. The letter can be added or subtracted at the front (LAUGHTER to SLAUGHTER), the back (HARP to HARPY), or anywhere in between (STRANGE to STRANGLE). You can add or delete multiple letters, such as taking out the entire middle of the spell BLINDNESS to make another spell, BLESS.": "一个字母可以被添加到一个词中或从一个词中减去，从而形成一个完全不同的词。字母可以在前面（LAUGHTER到SLAUGHTER）、后面（HARP到HARPY）或中间的任何地方（STRANGE到STRANGLE）添加或减少。你可以添加或删除多个字母，比如把整个咒语BLINDNESS的中间部分拿掉，变成另一个咒语BLESS。",
	"This encounter has both the shorter word and the longer word in plain sight. The puzzle comes in when the message is built around those words. The obfuscation provided by the other words suggests that the curse and the cure are spells rather than words for words' sake.": "这次相遇，较短的词和较长的词都在明处。当信息是围绕着这些词建立的时候，谜题就出现了。其他词所提供的模糊性表明，诅咒和解药是法术，而不是为了文字而文字。",
	"Design a logic problem as you would solve one: Winnow down many possibilities to one correct answer. A simple logic problem requires making sense of a single complex statement of relationship. Figure out what relationship you want between the elements in the problem. Find a roundabout way to describe the relationship. Then test all possibilities until you're sure only one can be right.": "设计一个逻辑问题，就像你解决一个问题一样。将许多可能性降至一个正确的答案。一个简单的逻辑问题需要对一个复杂的关系声明进行理解。弄清楚你想在问题中的各个元素之间建立什么关系。找到一种迂回的方式来描述这种关系。然后测试所有的可能性，直到你确定只有一种可能性是正确的。",
	"A more complex logic problem such as the one in this encounter involves multiple statements of a complex relationship. Think of what the logic puzzle will be about, and then select some appropriate variables on which the puzzle will turn. For the puzzle here, the elements are the colors (like blue), the activities (like raising the portcullis), and the sounds (like the gong).": "像这次遇到的这种比较复杂的逻辑问题，涉及到一个复杂关系的多种说法。想一想这道逻辑谜题将涉及什么，然后选择一些适当的变量，谜题就会转向这些变量。就这里的谜题而言，这些元素是颜色（如蓝色）、活动（如升起舷窗）和声音（如锣声）。",
	"Then lay the possibilities into a solving grid allowing for all the possibilities to meet each other (in this case it's color-and-activity, activity-and-sound, and color-and-sound). Here's one version. Write clues that eliminate possibilities for the solver until only the right answers remain. As you build clues, eliminate and confirm possibilities in the grid. Eliminated possibilities get an X, while confirmed possibilities get an O. So, the statement \"The red lever drains the moat and does not make a gong sound\" places an O at the intersection of \"red\" and \"moat,\" an X at the intersection of \"red\" and \"gong,\" and an X at the intersection of \"moat\" and \"gong.\" Because this sample is so small, this single clue can fill in the entire grid shown, but with more choices, more clues will be needed. Try to get the clue list down to the smallest number of clues possible, double-check the grid, and give the puzzle to your players (with or without the blank grid, depending on how nice you feel).": "然后将这些可能性铺成一个解题网格，允许所有的可能性相互见面（在这种情况下，它是颜色和活动，活动和声音，以及颜色和声音）。这里有一个版本。写下线索，消除解题者的可能性，直到只剩下正确答案。当你建立线索时，在网格中消除和确认可能性。因此，\"红色的杆子可以抽干护城河，但不会发出锣声 \"这句话在 \"红色 \"和 \"护城河 \"的交叉点上打了O，在 \"红色 \"和 \"锣 \"的交叉点上打了X，在 \"护城河 \"和 \"锣 \"的交叉点上打了X。因为这个样本太小了，这条线索可以填满所显示的整个网格，但是如果有更多的选择，就需要更多的线索。尽量将线索列表减少到最小的数量，仔细检查网格，然后将谜题交给你的玩家（是否有空白网格，取决于你觉得有多好）。",
	"Occasionally, your job as Dungeon Master calls for you to sell your players on believing one thing when the truth represents another. The following conceits are tried-and-true sales pitch techniques that are usually illegal in modern society. Nonetheless, you can use them in a variety of encounters. They're useful not only in this case, but also with deceitful NPCs and situations that are not as they seem. Chuk, the bugbear in this encounter, uses all these tricks if he thinks his profits will swell.": "偶尔，作为地下城管理员，你的工作需要你向你的玩家推销相信一件事，而事实却代表了另一件事。以下是久经考验的推销技巧，在现代社会通常是非法的。然而，你可以在各种情况下使用它们。它们不仅在这种情况下有用，而且对欺骗性的NPC和不像表面那样的情况也有用。楚克，这个遭遇中的虫子，如果他认为他的利润会膨胀，就会使用所有这些招数。",
	"{@bold The Old Bait-and-Switch}: A bait-and-switch offers an item for sale, but when the item is requested, the customer is told that the item is not available—and another one is. This plays upon the customer's desire to buy something, even if it's not what was desired. When characters are told that something is within their grasp, they might still be happy when they receive something else. Then again, they might not, especially if it is perceived to be of lesser value. A DM using a bait-and-switch should paint the reward acquired in the best possible light. For example, if the characters believe they are hunting a lich, when in fact, they have defeated a skeleton dressed up as a lich, have the local townsfolk hail them as lich-killers—even if the real lich gets away to plot its revenge.": "{@bold The Old Bait-and-Switch}: 诱骗式销售提供了一种商品，但当顾客要求购买该商品时，却被告知该商品不存在，而另一种商品却存在。这就利用了顾客的购买欲望，即使这不是他们想要的东西。当人物被告知某样东西在他们的掌握之中时，当他们收到其他东西时，他们可能仍然会很高兴。然而，他们也可能不高兴，特别是如果他们认为这个东西的价值较低的话。使用诱饵和转换的DM应该尽可能地描绘所获得的奖励。例如，如果角色们认为他们在猎杀一个巫师，而事实上，他们打败了一个装扮成巫师的骷髅，那么就让当地的老百姓称赞他们是巫师杀手--即使真正的巫师逃之夭夭去策划复仇了。",
	"{@bold The Hidden Cost}: A salesperson offering something for nothing may well be offering nothing for something. An item that appears to be free often is either worthless or has a hidden cost (usually one that's quite high). This plays on the instinctive human nature to take something that appears to be free. Those falling for this scam frequently ask, \"What's the catch?\" This is a can't-miss opportunity for the salesperson, because once the victim believes she's discovered all the hidden costs, she almost always makes the deal. For example, a character never leaves a magic item alone if she finds it unattended in the middle of a corridor. It may well be a monitoring device to keep tabs on the heroes, or a cursed item, or even a deathtrap. More importantly, though, it's free.": "{@bold The Hidden Cost}: 一个销售人员提供免费的东西，很可能是提供免费的东西。一个看似免费的东西往往不是毫无价值，就是有隐藏的成本（通常是相当高的成本）。这是对人类本能的利用，即接受看似免费的东西。那些上当受骗的人经常问：\"有什么好处？\" 这对销售人员来说是一个不能错过的机会，因为一旦受害者认为她已经发现了所有的隐藏费用，她几乎总是会做出交易。例如，如果一个角色发现一件魔法物品在走廊中间无人看管，她绝不会放过它。这很可能是一个监视英雄们的监控装置，或者是一个被诅咒的物品，甚至是一个死亡陷阱。但更重要的是，它是免费的。",
	"{@bold The Empty Promise}: In the absence of morality and law, a verbal promise is worth the paper it's printed on. A salesperson making a claim about an item's qualities need be concerned only about the ones that can be verified before purchase. After that, an item may break down, require a source of power, or simply not provide the service described. For example, someone selling a purported amulet of undead turning probably doesn't need to worry about buyers bringing undead with them to test its power. He may well have to worry about identify spells and the detection of abjuration magic, though, so he should take precautions to make sure the item holds up to such tests.": "{@bold The Empty Promise}: 在没有道德和法律的情况下，口头承诺的价值在于它所打印的纸张。销售人员在宣称一件商品的质量时，只需要关注那些在购买前可以验证的质量。之后，物品可能会出现故障，需要一个电源，或者根本无法提供所描述的服务。例如，有人出售所谓的亡灵转化护身符，可能不需要担心买家带着亡灵来测试其力量。不过，他很可能要担心识别法术和检测禁咒魔法的问题，所以他应该采取预防措施，确保该物品能经受住这种测试。",
	"{@bold The Unwarranted Warranty}: When an item fails in its purpose, the customer wants the ability to return the item for a refund or trade-in. An unscrupulous salesperson knows that the warranty is meaningless if the customer can't interact with the purveyor again. If the purveyor moves and cannot be found, the transaction is complete at the moment of sale. If the customer can't return to the purveyor (say, if the promised teleportation device doesn't bring the customer back after a thousand-mile trip), the transaction is also a one-time exchange. This is the genesis of the business principle caveat emptor, which generally means that without an enforceable warranty, the buyer takes the risk.": "{@bold The Unwarranted Warranty}: 当一件商品在使用过程中出现故障时，客户希望能够退回商品以获得退款或换货。不良销售人员知道，如果顾客不能再与供应商互动，那么保修就毫无意义。如果供应者搬走了，找不到了，交易在销售的那一刻就完成了。如果顾客不能回到供应者那里（例如，如果承诺的传送装置在千里之行后不能把顾客带回来），交易也是一次性的交换。这是商业原则caveat emptor的起源，一般来说，这意味着如果没有可执行的保证，买方要承担风险。",
	"{@bold The Loss Leader}: This legal technique is nonetheless easily abused. A loss leader is an item that's sold at a loss to encourage further purchases at a profit. If the buyer assumes further purchases have the same terms of transaction as the loss leader, the sale is duplicitous. Poker and pool players have seen this many times: A shark loses a first game to entice an unwary player in, but when the stakes rise, the shark's true ability surfaces. In a dungeon, if a party defeats a group of orcs easily, they may be caught off-guard when the next group of similar-looking orcs includes a few 5th-level barbarians.": "{@bold The Loss Leader}: 然而，这种合法技术很容易被滥用。亏损率是指以亏损的方式销售的商品，以鼓励进一步购买获利的商品。如果买方认为进一步购买的交易条件与亏损领先者相同，那么这种销售就是重复性的。扑克和桌球玩家已经多次看到这种情况。鲨鱼在第一场比赛中输掉了比赛，以引诱不明真相的玩家加入，但当赌注增加时，鲨鱼的真正能力就会浮现出来。在地下城中，如果一个团队轻松地打败了一群兽人，那么当下一群长相相似的兽人包括几个五级野蛮人时，他们可能会被打得措手不及。",
	"Different campaigns have different mapping protocols. In a typical dungeon setting, exact measurements are not usually as important as the general shape and directions of corridors. In fact, some groups draw maps that resemble flowcharts, with linethin corridors and simple squares for encounter areas.": "不同的活动有不同的测绘协议。在一个典型的地下城环境中，准确的测量通常不像走廊的一般形状和方向那么重要。事实上，有些团体绘制的地图类似于流程图，用线状的走廊和简单的方块表示遭遇区。",
	"Mazes can provide an additional challenge for mapping if the DM chooses. The DM could make it easy on the characters and give precise measurements, allowing them to make exact maps of the corridors. Alternatively, if she chooses, the DM could describe the corridors in more vague terms, such as \"it goes up a few feet and turns to the left.\" In a specific situation, such as this displacer beast maze encounter, the usual mundane task of mapping could become an interesting roleplaying encounter of its own. The characters may not have time to make exact maps between the hit-and-run tactics of the beasts.": "如果DM选择，迷宫可以为绘图提供额外的挑战。DM可以让角色轻松一点，给出精确的测量值，让他们绘制出走廊的精确地图。或者，如果她选择的话，DM可以用更模糊的术语来描述走廊，比如 \"它往上走了几英尺，然后向左转\"。在一个特定的情况下，比如这个流离兽迷宫的遭遇，通常平凡的测绘任务可以成为一个有趣的角色扮演的遭遇。角色们可能没有时间在野兽们的打了就跑的战术之间做出精确的地图。",
	"Moving the PCs from location to location in a nonlinear fashion—that is, through locations other than rooms, halls, and doors—is the best way of handling a high-level maze. Using nonlinear rooms for a maze keeps the Dungeon Master in control. Each room is miles apart from the others. The party can't scout ahead, since they don't know where the next room will be.": "以非线性的方式将PC从一个地方移动到另一个地方--也就是说，通过房间、大厅和门以外的地方--是处理高级迷宫的最佳方式。在迷宫中使用非线性的房间可以让地下城管理员保持控制。每个房间都与其他房间相距甚远。队伍不能提前侦查，因为他们不知道下一个房间会在哪里。",
	"As an added threat, the \"paths\" can easily lead into inhospitable environments, such as deep underground, under the ocean, or high on a mountaintop. Some means of exiting the room, such as a blink spell, might introduce a character to a place where he really doesn't want to be. Sure, the characters can leave the room using etherealness, but that won't accomplish anything.": "作为一个额外的威胁，这些 \"路径 \"可以很容易地通向荒凉的环境，比如地下深处、海洋之下或山顶上。一些退出房间的手段，比如眨眼咒语，可能会把角色引入一个他真的不想去的地方。当然，人物可以用空灵的方式离开房间，但这并不能达到任何目的。",
	"A magic trap or item that uses teleport without error to herd the party along can work reasonably well, though a rogue can find and disable it. Beware of using teleport effects that can be dispelled, such as a permanent teleportation circle. With a good dispel check, a caster might cut off their means of travel!": "使用无误的传送来驱赶队伍的魔法陷阱或物品可以起到相当好的作用，尽管流氓可以发现并禁用它。小心使用可以被驱散的传送效果，比如一个永久的传送圈。如果驱散检查得好，施法者可能会切断他们的旅行方式！\"。",
	"The Stronghold Builder's Guidebook describes how portals are built and function. In the simplest terms, a portal is a magic item that forms a permanent doorway between two different places. This encounter uses a magical effect essentially identical to a portal (though you don't need any additional information to use it).": "堡垒建造者指南》描述了传送门的建造和功能。最简单的说法是，传送门是一种魔法物品，在两个不同的地方之间形成一个永久的门洞。这个奇遇使用了一种与传送门基本相同的魔法效果（尽管你不需要任何额外的信息来使用它）。",

	"For low- to mid-level adventurers, extend the maze from your starting point (or points) into a true path -- the \"right\" way through the maze. The true path should lead in a zigzagging manner to your exit.

Make sure you have left only one true path, and verify that it still leads to the end.": "对于中低级别的冒险者来说，将迷宫从你的起点（或点）延伸到真正的路径--通过迷宫的 \"正确 \"方式。真正的路径应该以 \"之 \"字形的方式通向你的出口。一旦你定义了一条真路，就从你的真路延伸出假路，再从假路延伸出更多的假路，直到你填满迷宫中的每一条路。确保你只留下了一条真路，并验证它是否仍能通向终点。",
	"For higher-level adventurers, you'll need to reckon with passwall, find the path, disintegrate, and other maze-thwarting spells. For these powerhouses, include teleportation circles that pop PCs around the maze, illusory walls, impenetrable darkness to confound measurements, and shifting passages that change after PCs have walked through them. Triggered maze spells can also confuse PCs wandering where they should not.": "对于更高级别的冒险者来说，你需要考虑壁垒、寻路、瓦解和其他破坏迷宫的法术。对于这些强者来说，包括在迷宫中弹出的传送圈、虚幻的墙壁、迷惑测量的不可穿透的黑暗，以及个人走过后会发生变化的转移通道。触发的迷宫法术也可以迷惑走在不该走的地方的人。",
	"Finally, populate your maze with dangers and denizens, including the obvious minotaurs. Incorporeal creatures are not bound by such trivialities as walls.

	"Riddles can range from mere trivia to actual problemsolving. Consider the following examples.": "谜语的范围可以从单纯的琐事到实际的问题解决。请看下面的例子。",
	"\"If I catch you with my claws, you will bear my young. What am I?\" This is just a trivia question. The players need to have read and remembered that a red slaad can implant an egg with a successful claw attack. If you prefer, the characters can solve this puzzle with a simple skill check, but that's not much fun.": "\"如果我用我的爪子抓住你，你将生下我的孩子。我是什么？\" 这只是一个小问题。玩家需要阅读并记住，红蜘蛛可以通过成功的爪子攻击来植入一个蛋。如果你愿意，角色们可以用简单的技能检查来解决这个难题，但这并不怎么有趣。",
	"\"I'm one of the nastiest spellcasting outsiders you'll meet. Scramble me up and I'm healthy to eat.\" This riddle adds a word puzzle, making it little more inventive. Here the answer is green slaad (which, scrambled up, makes green salad). Although this still requires a bit of knowledge, it's no longer a straight trivia memory question. The players have something they can figure out, scrambling the letters to get the answer. Of course, word puzzles of all types impose real-world languages onto a fantasy setting, and not everyone wants this.": "\"我是你会遇到的最讨厌的施法外来者之一。把我炒了，我就可以健康地吃了。\" 这个谜语增加了一个字谜，使其更具创造性。这里的答案是绿沙拉（炒起来就成了绿沙拉）。虽然这仍然需要一些知识，但它不再是一个直接的琐事记忆问题。选手们有了自己能想出来的东西，通过争夺字母来得到答案。当然，各种类型的文字谜题都是把现实世界的语言强加到幻想的环境中，而不是每个人都想这样。",
	"Classic riddles are tempting, but you'll need to beware of their complications, or at least be flexible when you use them. A classic riddle won't always yield a single, definitive answer in a world replete with magic. Consider this classic riddle: \"I walk on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening.\" In our world, this riddle had one answer: a human. In a D&D world, the answer could not only be a humanoid, but hundreds of different beings, including a treant druid using her wild shape ability and a dragon sorcerer casting polymorph self.": "经典谜语很诱人，但你需要提防它们的复杂性，或者至少在使用它们时要灵活。在一个充满魔法的世界里，一个经典的谜语并不总是能得到一个单一的、确定的答案。考虑一下这个经典的谜语。\"我早上用四条腿走路，中午用两条腿，晚上用三条腿。\" 在我们的世界里，这个谜语有一个答案：一个人。在D&D的世界里，答案不仅可以是人形，还可以是数百种不同的生物，包括使用野生形状能力的树人德鲁伊和施展多态自我的龙人巫师。",
	"Using riddles provides challenges to the DM as much as the players. How can you assign an EL to a riddle? Should it be based on the trap or creature delivering the puzzle? At first this may seem like a good idea, but some riddles are easier than others. Should a dragon that asks an easy riddle be worth more experience to the players than an orc that asks a tough one? Of course not. Experience points for monsters are awarded when they themselves are the challenge.": "使用谜语对管理员和玩家来说都是一种挑战。你怎么能给谜语指定一个EL？是否应该以提供谜语的陷阱或生物为依据？起初这似乎是个好主意，但有些谜语比其他谜语更容易。对玩家来说，一条问出简单谜语的龙应该比一个问出困难谜语的兽人更有经验吗？当然不是。怪物的经验值是在它们本身就是挑战时授予的。",
	"A DM who enjoys riddles should reward players for solving them. We advocate three possible methods for giving out fair rewards: ad hoc experience points, treasure, or matching the riddle to an appropriate threat.": "一个喜欢猜谜语的管理员应该奖励解谜的玩家。我们主张用三种可能的方法来发放公平的奖励：特设的经验值、财宝，或将谜语与适当的威胁相匹配。",
	"Ad hoc experience points are discussed in the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide and include variants for story awards. A DM can assign straight XP values to each riddle she poses. Alternatively, the DM can offer a piece of treasure as a reward. For instance, a copper dragon may engage the PCs in a riddle contest and give them a wondrous item as a reward if they can stump him.": "在《DUNGEON MASTER's Guide》中讨论了特设的经验值，包括故事奖励的变体。DM可以为她提出的每个谜语直接分配XP值。或者，DM可以提供一件宝物作为奖励。例如，铜龙可以让NPC参加谜语竞赛，如果他们能难倒他，就给他们一件神奇的物品作为奖励。",
	"Perhaps the most straightforward method is pairing riddles with creatures that are appropriately tough for the characters. If the creature attacks when the PCs answer incorrectly, or refuse to answer at all, the EL is easy to assign. A DM should exercise a bit of thought and care in selecting creatures to deliver riddles. It's more than just a matter of getting the CR correct (for instance, a dire tiger, gray render, and gynosphinx are all CR 8). This method requires the DM to create the right atmosphere and have the presentation make sense. Dire tigers are animals, so they can't talk. Gray renders have near-animal intelligence and wouldn't have the patience to listen to a riddle, much less devise one. The gynosphinx, however, is an intelligent monster and an obvious choice.": "也许最直接的方法是将谜语与对人物来说适当艰难的生物配对。如果该生物在NPC回答错误时进行攻击，或者根本拒绝回答，那么EL就很容易分配了。在选择传递谜语的生物时，DM应该深思熟虑，谨慎行事。这不仅仅是让CR正确的问题（例如，可怕的老虎、灰色渲染器和妇科动物都是CR 8）。这种方法要求DM创造合适的气氛，并使表述有意义。猛虎是动物，所以它们不能说话。灰袍人有接近动物的智力，不会有耐心听一个谜语，更不会设计一个谜语。然而，雌性动物是一个聪明的怪物，是一个明显的选择。",
	"Multiple-opponent encounters usually provide more of a challenge than a single creature—both for the characters and the DM. Multiple opponents can flank, they aren't as vulnerable to \"save or lose\" spells such as hold monster or disintegrate, and it's harder for PCs to gang up on them.": "多个对手的遭遇通常比单个生物提供更多的挑战--无论是对角色还是对DM。多个对手可以从侧面攻击，他们不容易受到 \"不救则已 \"的法术的伤害，比如 \"控制怪物 \"或 \"瓦解\"，而且NPC也很难联合起来对付他们。",
	"On the other hand, multiple-opponent encounters give a wider array of classes an opportunity to contribute. In Dark Hunt, paladins and clerics can use their special powers against the undead. The rogue can sneak attack the living creatures and team up with other characters for flanking bonuses. Rangers also have several potentials for their favored enemy bonus: undead, magical beasts, and outsiders.": "另一方面，多个对手的遭遇战给了更多类别的人做出贡献的机会。在黑暗狩猎中，圣骑士和牧师可以使用他们的特殊力量来对付亡灵。游侠可以偷袭活物，并与其他角色组队获得侧翼的奖励。游侠也有几个潜在的有利敌人的奖励：亡灵、魔兽和外来者。",
	"Of course, running a complex, multiple-opponent encounter can be a hassle. Here are some tips to help these kinds of encounters move smoothly.": "当然，运行一个复杂的、有多个对手的遭遇战可能是一件麻烦事。这里有一些提示，可以帮助这些类型的遭遇战顺利地进行。",
	"{@i Simplify Initiative}. Roll initiative by type of monster instead of rolling for each individual creature. Combine mounts with their riders, taking whichever is worse. For instance, this encounter has eight creatures, but you can simplify their actions by having three initiative rolls: Valencia and her nightmare mount, Falessel and her nightmare mount, and the winter wolves.": "{@i Simplify Initiative}. 按怪物的类型来计算主动权，而不是为每一种生物计算。将坐骑和它们的骑手结合起来，取其最差的一个。例如，这次遭遇有八个生物，但你可以通过三个主动权卷来简化它们的行动。瓦伦西亚和她的恶梦坐骑，法勒塞尔和她的恶梦坐骑，以及冬狼。",
	"{@i Use note cards}. Put each player character, NPC, and monster type on a note card. Note their initiative counts and sort them by those numbers. Once the action starts, you can flip through the cards to tell who goes next. If someone wants to delay, lay the card aside and reinsert it when they take their action. With a bit of planning, your note cards can be more elaborate. For instance, you might find it useful to include the character or creature's Spot skill or Armor Class.": "{@i Use note cards}. 把每个玩家角色、NPC和怪物类型放在一张纸条卡上。记下他们的行动次数，并按这些数字分类。一旦行动开始，你就可以翻开卡片，告诉他们谁是下一个。如果有人想拖延时间，就把卡片放在一边，等他们采取行动时再把它放进去。只要稍加计划，你的便条卡就可以做得更精细。例如，你可能会发现包括人物或生物的点穴技能或装甲等级是很有用的。",
	"{@i Keep accurate records}. Create a small table to track hit points (and initiative counts, if you're not using note cards). Many DMs do this on scratch paper or in the margins of the text, but for complicated encounters, a separate table can come in handy. You can also list other pertinent notes, such as resistances. The Dark Hunt Summary Page provides an example.": "{@i Keep accurate records}. 建立一个小表格来追踪命中率（如果你不使用笔记卡的话，还有主动权计数）。许多管理人在划线纸上或在文本的空白处这样做，但对于复杂的遭遇战，单独的表格会很方便。你还可以列出其他相关的说明，比如抵抗力。黑暗狩猎总结页》提供了一个例子。",
	"A variety of skills or spells might allow the characters to solve this crisis in a calm and simple manner. Remember that these animals have not yet become familiars. Thus, they are still animals (and not magical beasts).": "各种技能或法术可能会让人物以平静而简单的方式解决这一危机。请记住，这些动物还没有成为亲属。因此，它们仍然是动物（而不是魔兽）。",
	"{@skill Animal Handling|phb} can improve the attitude of an animal with a successful check. Assume that the cat begins as hostile and the rest begin as unfriendly. Any animal whose attitude is adjusted to friendly returns to its cage.": "{@skill Animal Handling|phb}可以在检查成功后改善动物的态度。假设猫开始时是敌对的，其余的开始时是不友好的。任何态度被调整为友好的动物都会回到它的笼子里。",
	"{@spell Animal friendship} (Drd 1, Rgr 1) can win the loyalty of a single animal, but only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. That's unlikely to be the case in this situation.": "{@spell Animal friendship} (Drd 1, Rgr 1) 可以赢得一只动物的忠诚，但前提是施法者确实希望成为该动物的朋友。在这种情况下，这种情况不太可能发生。",
	"{@spell Calm emotions} can be used soothes and quiet an animals, rendering them docile. They neither attack nor flee, allowing PCs to gently reach them and place them into cages.": "{@spell Calm emotions}可以用来舒缓和安静动物，使它们变得温顺。它们既不攻击也不逃跑，允许NPC轻轻地接近它们并将它们放入笼子。",
	"{@spell Charm Monster} makes a single animal regard the caster as its trusted friend. A charmed animal gladly returns to its cage.": "{@spell Charm Monster}使一只动物视施法者为其信任的朋友。被魅惑的动物会很高兴地回到它的笼子里。",
	"{@spell Hypnotic Pattern} allows the caster to make a brief and reasonable request of affected creatures, which might include \"return to your cages.\"": "{@spell Hypnotic Pattern}允许施法者对受影响的生物提出一个简短而合理的请求，其中可能包括 \"回到你们的笼子里\"。",
	"{@spell Sleep} solves the problem by simply putting the animals into a deep slumber, after which the PCs can easily gather them up.": "{@spell Sleep}解决了这个问题，只需让动物进入深度沉睡状态，之后NPC就可以很容易地把它们收集起来。",
	"Dungeon Masters often use the Monster Manual the same way they use dictionaries. They open it up to check the statistics of a troupe of orcs or pack of gorgons the same way you would use a dictionary to check the spelling of \"porcine\" or \"petrification.\" However, just as the dictionary can't teach the best way to put words together in everyday speech, the Monster Manual doesn't tell you which combinations of monsters work well in encounters. With this in mind, don't limit your \"syntax\" to single monsters. Combining them can make for some interesting alternatives.": "地下城管理员经常使用《怪物手册》，就像他们使用字典一样。他们打开它来检查一群兽人或一群戈尔贡人的统计数据，就像你用字典来检查 \"猪 \"或 \"石化 \"的拼写方式一样。然而，就像字典不能教你在日常讲话中如何将单词放在一起的最佳方法一样，《怪物手册》也不能告诉你哪些怪物的组合在遭遇战中很有效。考虑到这一点，不要把你的 \"语法 \"限制在单个怪物上。将它们结合起来可以产生一些有趣的变化。",
	"Troll and Pets, which features a hermitlike troll and his pet rust monsters, is only one combination of many that can be created with careful  planning. Creatures with powers that complement each other are especially good choices, such as the vampires and nightmares in Dark Hunt (an EL 13 encounter later in this book). Few rules need to be followed when mixing monster types, as long as you can create plausible reasoning behind your choices.": "巨魔与宠物》的主角是一个像隐士一样的巨魔和他的宠物锈迹斑斑的怪物，这只是众多组合中的一个，只要仔细计划就可以创造出来。具有相互补充能力的生物是特别好的选择，例如《黑暗狩猎》中的吸血鬼和噩梦（本书后面的EL13遭遇战）。在混合怪物类型时，几乎不需要遵循什么规则，只要你能在你的选择背后创造合理的理由。",
	"In general, stronger creatures bully or control weaker creatures. This situation might change if the weaker creature is significantly smarter, such as a cunning imp leading an uneducated hill giant. Very powerful creatures do not usually ally with other creatures but may still use them as minions, pets, and slaves. Powerful creatures, on the other hand, often have enough resources to get what they want and survive on their own.": "一般来说，强壮的生物会欺负或控制弱小的生物。如果较弱的生物明显更聪明，这种情况可能会改变，比如一个狡猾的小恶魔领导一个没有受过教育的山地巨人。非常强大的生物通常不与其他生物结盟，但仍可能将它们作为爪牙、宠物和奴隶。另一方面，强大的生物通常有足够的资源来获得他们想要的东西，并独自生存。",
	"When creatures work in tandem, each should have its own motivation. Those motivations could be similar, but it makes for a short companionship if their needs aren't met. For example, a drider and a hill giant may form a temporary alliance to drive off inhabitants of a small village that has been unknowingly built on a system of caverns. In this case, the drider gains a new lair and the giant gets valuable treasure, along with the village's herd of cattle. The two may never work together again, or they may team up to raid a small dwarven mining village down the road later that month when the cows run out, no doubt leading to another unusual encounter for the player characters.": "当生物在一起工作时，每个人都应该有自己的动机。这些动机可能是相似的，但如果它们的需求没有得到满足，就会造成短暂的同伴关系。例如，龙骑士和山丘巨人可能会组成一个临时联盟，以赶走一个小村庄的居民，而这个村庄是在不知不觉中建立在一个洞穴系统上的。在这种情况下，龙骑士获得了一个新的巢穴，而巨人则得到了宝贵的财宝，以及村子里的牛群。这两个人可能再也不合作了，也可能在当月晚些时候，当牛群耗尽时，他们会联手突袭路边的一个小矮人采矿村，这无疑会导致玩家角色的另一次不寻常的遭遇。",

In some cases, a creature's opponents may get a bonus to attack the creature. The effects are summarized below:": "陆地上的生物在水中战斗时可能会有相当大的困难。水会影响一个生物的护甲等级、攻击卷、伤害和移动。在某些情况下，生物的对手可能会得到攻击该生物的奖励。这些影响总结如下。",
	"{@bold Fire: Nonmagical fire (including alchemist's fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like effects with the Fire descriptor are ineffective underwater unless the caster makes a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but otherwise the spell works as described. Supernatural fire effects are ineffective underwater unless their descriptions state otherwise.": "{非魔法之火（包括炼金术士之火）不会在水下燃烧。带有火的描述符的法术或类似法术的效果在水下是无效的，除非施法者成功进行法术检查（DC15+法术等级）。如果检定成功，该法术会产生一个蒸汽泡，而不是其通常的火热效果，但除此之外，该法术的效果与描述的一样。超自然的火焰效果在水下是无效的，除非它们的描述中另有说明。",
	"The surface of a body of water blocks line of effect for any fire spell. If the caster has made a Spellcraft check to make the fire spell useful underwater, the surface still blocks the spell's line of effect. For example, a fireball cast underwater cannot be targeted at creatures above the surface.": "水体的表面会阻挡任何火系法术的效果。如果施法者进行了法术检查以使火系法术在水下发挥作用，那么水面仍然会阻挡法术的效果线。例如，在水下施放的火球不能针对水面上的生物。",
	"{@bold Attacks from Land}: Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep have one-quarter cover against melee or ranged attacks from opponents on land. Land-bound opponents who have freedom of movement effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has one-half cover against opponents on land unless those opponents have a freedom of movement effects. Magical effects are unaffected, except for those that require attack rolls (which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.": "{@bold Attacks from Land}: 在水面上游泳、漂浮或踩水的角色，或在至少齐胸深的水中涉水的角色，对来自陆地上对手的近战或远程攻击有四分之一的掩护。拥有行动自由效果的陆地上的对手在对水中的目标进行近战攻击时，会忽略这个掩护。一个完全被淹没的生物对陆地上的对手有一半的掩护，除非这些对手有移动自由的效果。魔法效果不受影响，除了那些需要攻击卷的效果（其处理方式与其他效果相同）和火力效果。",
	"{@bold Ranged Attacks Underwater}:Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from land. Other ranged weapons suffer a–2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water they pass through, in addition to the normal penalties for range.": "{@bold Ranged Attacks Underwater}:投掷的武器在水下是无效的，即使是在陆地上发射。其他远程武器每通过5英尺的水，其攻击卷就会受到2的惩罚，此外还有正常范围的惩罚。",
	"{@bold Underwater Visibility}: Submerged or swimming creatures may also gain concealment from the water, depending on how clear it is. Even perfectly clear water obscures vision (including darkvision) beyond 200 feet. A creature in perfectly clear water has one-quarter concealment at 50 feet (10% miss chance), one-half concealment at 100 feet (20% miss chance), three-quarters concealment at 150 feet (30% miss chance), and nine-tenths concealment at 200 feet (40% miss chance). Beyond 200 feet, the creature has total concealment (50% miss chance) and opponents cannot use sight to locate it.": "{@bold Underwater Visibility}: 被淹没或游泳的生物也可以从水中获得隐蔽性，这取决于水的清澈程度。即使是完全清澈的水在200英尺以外也会遮蔽视线（包括暗视）。在完全清澈的水中的生物在50英尺处有四分之一的隐蔽性（10%的失误机会），在100英尺处有二分之一的隐蔽性（20%的失误机会），在150英尺处有四分之三的隐蔽性（30%的失误机会），在200英尺处有十分之九的隐蔽性（40%的失误机会）。超过200英尺后，该生物就完全隐蔽了（50%的失误率），对手无法用视觉来定位它。",
	"Water that isn't as clear obscures vision at a shorter distance, and creatures in it are concealed at a shorter distance. Creatures have one-half concealment at half the given distance, nine-tenths concealment at the given distance, and total concealment beyond that distance.

	"Antimagic zones seem like an easy solution to controlling high-level characters, but like any other tactic, they should be used in moderation. Characters presumably earn the magic items they possess, so throwing antimagic zones at them every time you want to toughen up an encounter can discourage PCs. Overusing this tactic goes over about as well as giving a character a ring of fire resistance before leading him into an underwater adventure. Antimagic is also a double-edged sword, since higher-level monsters may also rely on magical or supernatural abilities.": "反魔法区似乎是控制高级角色的一个简单的解决方案，但就像其他战术一样，它们应该被适度使用。角色大概是靠他们所拥有的魔法物品获得的，所以每次你想让他们在遭遇战中变得更强硬时，就把反魔法区扔给他们，这可能会使NPC感到沮丧。过度使用这种策略，就像在带领一个角色进入水下冒险之前给他一个抗火环一样。反魔法也是一把双刃剑，因为更高级别的怪物也可能依赖魔法或超自然的能力。",
	"When you use the tactic, be creative with the reasoning. If antimagic were easy to obtain, every fortress would be covered in it to prevent magical invasion. Use unique circumstances, such as a puzzle or trap, and give the players a way to circumvent it. Players feel much less manipulated if the zones are used to accent a tough encounter, instead of being the sole reason for its design.": "当你使用这种战术时，要有创造性的推理。如果反魔法很容易获得，每个堡垒都会被覆盖在它上面，以防止魔法入侵。使用独特的环境，如谜题或陷阱，并给玩家一个绕过它的方法。如果这些区域被用来强调一个艰难的遭遇，而不是成为其设计的唯一原因，那么玩家就不会感到被操纵。",
	"Nearly all adventures draw their drama from the classic struggle of good versus evil. While players may choose characters with neutral alignments, the vast majority of adventuring parties are predominantly good. Whether this is as obvious and straightforward as a demon-slaying paladin, or more indirect, such as a rogue who loots the lairs of evil monsters, most of the time, characters work toward a good cause.": "几乎所有的冒险都是从经典的正义与邪恶的斗争中汲取经验。虽然玩家可以选择中立的角色，但绝大多数的冒险队伍都是以善为主的。无论这是像屠杀恶魔的圣骑士那样明显和直接，还是像抢劫邪恶怪物巢穴的流氓那样更间接，大多数时候，角色都在为一个好的事业努力。",

A character who knows Abyssal can determine the passphrase with a DC 15 Intelligence check, though sometimes the passphrase is more difficult to discover and a clever carver may hide it in a riddle within the runes. Dealing 50 damage to the door's frame renders the trap inert until it is repaired. The AC for the doorframe depends on the material of which it is made (wood AC 15, stone AC 17, metal AC 19).": "当最后一个符文被刻好后，这个序列就会消失在门框里。用DC15智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查可以发现这些符文，但如果一个角色用手沿着门框摸索，并在DC10智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查中成功，就可以感觉到这些符文。了解深渊的人可以通过DC15智力检查来确定密码，尽管有时密码更难发现，聪明的雕刻家可能会把它藏在符文的谜语中。对门框造成50的伤害会使陷阱失去作用，直到它被修复。门框的AC取决于它的材质（木质AC15，石质AC17，金属AC19）。",
