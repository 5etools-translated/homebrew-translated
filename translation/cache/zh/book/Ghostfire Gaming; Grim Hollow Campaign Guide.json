Stimulating lust to extremes, it is rumoured to have prevented city garrisons from defending the walls on several occasions, allowing fortified cities to be taken easily where a years-long siege was expected. The exact propagation vector of the disease is not known with certainty as several variants-or shades-of the disease seem to coexist, strangely appearing in a region only to spontaneously disappear some time later.

Like the windows below, a warm amber glow radiates from behind this turret's frosted glass, backlighting a hulking figure that moves quickly out of sight.": "这个地方是一座石头建筑，有一个石板屋顶和几个烟囱，烟囱的烟雾像招手的手指一样向天空卷起。酒馆有两层。一楼是酒馆宽敞的公共休息室，这是一个由不匹配的家具和过度膨胀的扶手椅组成的家庭式杂物，围绕着一个令人印象深刻的中央壁炉。壁炉上挂着一个头像。酒馆的上层为客人提供了舒适、简单的房间。一个较小的阁楼空间有一个圆锥形的塔楼，坐落在二楼的顶部。和下面的窗户一样，温暖的琥珀色光芒从这个塔楼的磨砂玻璃后面散发出来，背光照亮了一个迅速离开视线的巨大身影。",
	"Once the characters are inside the entryway facing the common room, the front door swings shut behind them with a soft click, dematerialising into solid stone. Inspection of the wall reveals that the vanishing door is not an illusion, and the characters are now trapped inside. The initial glamour of joviality and refuge is revealed to be a lure projected by the tavern as a means of enticing new prey. The true patrons slouch gloomily around tables, muttering in hushed tones.": "一旦人物进入面向公共房间的入口处，前门就会在他们身后关上，发出一声轻响，变成了坚固的石头。对墙壁的检查显示，消失的门并不是幻觉，人物现在被困在里面了。最初的欢乐和庇护的魅力被发现是酒馆为了引诱新的猎物而投下的诱饵。真正的顾客阴沉着脸围着桌子，用沙哑的声音嘀咕着。",
	"The taproom occupies a small alcove to the left of the entrance, and is stocked with barrels of maplewood ale and aged wine. Bryn stands behind the bar, washing tankards. He is an imposing figure among the tavern guests, with a broad adventurer's build. He regards the newcomers with a surly expression. \"You might as well sit down,\" he says gruffly. The other occupants are likewise unwelcoming, and stare at the characters with murmurs of, \"More of ‘em ey,\" and, \"Tavern's caught a right brace of ‘em this time.\"": "自来水室占据了入口处左边的一个小凹槽，里面放着一桶桶枫木麦芽酒和陈年葡萄酒。布林站在吧台后面，清洗酒罐。在酒馆的客人中，他是个威严的人物，有着宽大的冒险家的身材。他用一种愤怒的表情看着新来的人。\"你们还是坐下吧。\"他粗声粗气地说。其他住客也同样不欢迎他们，他们盯着这些人物，喃喃自语道：\"又来了，\"还有，\"酒馆这次抓到了一队人。\"",
	"The tavern occupants are peculiarly mismatched, and not just because they are unlikely traveling companions. A DC13 Intelligence (history) check reaveals they appear to be from different time periods and distant lands, reflected in their dress and speech, though most appear to speak Common. A bard perched on the arm of an overstuffed armchair by the hearth tunes a lute distractedly, testing the strings. He watches the newcomers languidly from beneath a Renaissance-style velvet muffin-hat.": "酒馆里的人特别不相配，不仅仅是因为他们是不可能的旅伴。通过DC13智力（历史）检查发现，他们似乎来自不同的时代和遥远的国度，这反映在他们的穿着和言语上，尽管大多数人似乎都说普通话。一个吟游诗人躺在壁炉边的软垫扶手上，心不在焉地调着琵琶，测试着琴弦。他从一顶文艺复兴风格的天鹅绒松糕帽下无精打采地看着新来的人。",
	"The common room is homely and in good repair, and contains the following features:": "公用室是家庭式的，修缮得很好，包含以下特点。",
	"{@b {@i Mounted Head.}} Above the hearth, a mounted head shifts shape between a boar, black bear, and a crowned stag each time a character turns to look at it. Hidden deep in the maw of the boar head is the seeing stone (pg. 232). If the players find the seeing stone before they meet Inorim and use it correctly they can bypass meeting Inorim in his pocket dimension.": "{@b {@i Mounted Head.}}在壁炉上方，每当人物转头看它时，一个骑在上面的头就会在野猪、黑熊和有冠的雄鹿之间变换形状。在野猪头的嘴里深藏着一块看见石头（第232页）。如果玩家在遇到伊诺瑞姆之前找到看见石头并正确使用它，他们就可以绕过伊诺瑞姆在他的口袋空间里见面。",
	"{@b {@i Bookshelf.}} Books slide off the shelves and leaf through their own pages as if an unseen reader is perusing them. Characters who attempt to read a book from this shelf find that the book shreds itself to tatters in their hands.": "{@b {@i Bookshelf.}} 书籍从书架上滑落下来，翻开自己的书页，仿佛一个看不见的读者在阅读它们。试图从这个书架上读一本书的人发现，书在他们手中被撕成了碎片。",
	"{@b {@i Wine Barrels.}} The aged wine in these barrels spontaneously turns to vinegar and back to wine again. Patrons have made a sort of roulette game from this temperamental brew.}} These barrels replenish themselves when empty.": "{@b {@i Wine Barrels.}}这些桶中的陈酒会自发地变成醋，然后又变成酒。食客们用这种喜怒无常的酒做了一种轮盘游戏。｝ 这些木桶在空的时候会自行补充。",
	"{@b {@i Hearthside Tables.}} Tables attempt to trip careless occupants who forget to put a coaster beneath their drinks.": "{@b {@i Hearthside Tables.}}桌子试图绊倒那些忘记在饮料下面放一个杯垫的粗心乘客。",
	"{@b {@i Hearth Rug.}} A fine rug patterned with olive branches and filigree spirals. If a fight breaks out among the occupants, this rug of smothering will intervene, entangling the aggressors until the fighting stops.": "{@b {@i Hearth Rug.}}一块精美的地毯，上面有橄榄枝和丝状螺旋线的图案。如果居住者之间发生争斗，这块窒息的地毯就会介入，将侵犯者缠住，直到战斗停止。",
	"{@b {@i Armour.}} The suit of animated armour standing by the former doorway (with the stats of a helmed horror) enforces the tavern's justice, attacking anyone who attempts to escape while new prey is being lured into the tavern. If the animated armour is reduced to 0 hit points it falls {@condition unconscious} for 1 minute. After that it returns to maximum hit points and returns to its previous role.": "{@b {@i Armour.}}站在以前门口的灵动盔甲（具有头盔恐怖的属性）执行酒馆的正义，在新的猎物被引诱到酒馆时攻击任何试图逃跑的人。如果动画盔甲的命中率降至0，它就会在1分钟内下降（%1%）。之后它恢复到最大命中率，并恢复到之前的角色。",
	"If any character consults a compass in the common room or tap room, they will find that the compass points toward a trapdoor behind the bar leading down into the basement. (Anywhere else in the tavern, a compass needle will merely spin erratically.)": "如果任何角色在公共休息室或自来水房里查看罗盘，他们会发现罗盘指向酒吧后面的一个通往地下室的活板门。(在酒馆的任何其他地方，罗盘的指针只会不规则地旋转）。",
	"The tap room contains a long wooden bar surrounded by leather-topped bar stools.": "自来水房里有一个长长的木制吧台，周围摆放着皮革顶的吧椅。",
	"A row of smaller ale kegs lines the far wall, above which sits a shelf littered with pewter tankards and sherry glasses. There is a sink behind the bar for washing used tankards. After Bryn washes the tankards, an animated dishtowel busies itself with drying the tankards, which promptly return themselves to the cluttered shelves until their next use. Bryn also keeps his enchanted greatsword behind the bar, where he can keep an eye on it.": "远处的墙上有一排较小的啤酒桶，上面放着一个架子，上面堆满了锡制的酒罐和雪利酒杯。吧台后面有一个水槽，用于清洗用过的酒罐。布林洗完酒杯后，一条灵动的抹布忙着擦干酒杯，酒杯又迅速回到了杂乱的架子上，直到下次使用。布林还把他的魔法大剑放在吧台后面，他可以在那里盯着它。",
	"A wooden trapdoor can be found behind the bar. It sits flush with the floor and has no visible handle or hinges. It cannot be forced open by any means. A triangular notch has been carved into the wood.": "在酒吧后面可以找到一个木制活板门。它与地面平齐，没有明显的把手或铰链。用任何方法都无法强行打开。在木头上刻有一个三角形的凹槽。",
	"The kitchen is a small back room extending off the tap room. At the centre of the room is a butcher's block, which is cluttered with earthen pots of spices, herbs, and a large portion of salted pork. A larder stocked with jams, meats, and vegetables occupies the far wall.": "厨房是延伸到自来水房外的一个小密室。房间的中央是一个肉块，上面杂乱地摆放着装有香料、草药和一大片咸猪肉的陶罐。一个储存着果酱、肉类和蔬菜的贮藏室占据了远处的墙壁。",
	"Hanging nets of potatoes, onions, and a wreath of garlic occupy the walls at random intervals. A large cookstove is cluttered with cast-iron pots and pans, each one scrubbed to a well-used shine. Supplies in the kitchen replenish themselves, and though the sound of cooking can be heard from the common room, those who push open the door see only the empty kitchen. Prepared meals simply appear on the butcher's block, ready to be served.": "挂着的土豆、洋葱和大蒜花环的网在墙上随意摆放着。一个大炉灶上杂乱地摆放着铸铁锅和平底锅，每一个都被擦洗得光亮如新。厨房里的用品自行补充，虽然从休息室可以听到烹饪的声音，但推开门的人只看到空荡荡的厨房。准备好的饭菜简单地出现在肉块上，随时可以上桌。",
	"Suddenly, a fight breaks out. Read or paraphrase the following:": "突然间，一场战斗爆发了。阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"The murmur of conversation and the burble of ale being poured from stout kegs barely muffles the discordant strumming of a bard tuning his lute by the hearth.": "谈话的杂音和从坚固的酒桶中倒出的啤酒的隆隆声，几乎无法掩盖吟游诗人在壁炉边调琴的不和谐的弦乐。",
	"Then, the noise is eclipsed by an antagonised shout: \"Yer thieving lout! Cheat me out of my winnings, will ya?\" Suddenly, a female half-orc catches a feral, swinging uppercut from a rough-shaven male human. Two other humans sitting nearby spring to defend the man with weapons drawn, but not before the half-orc beheads the man with a two-handed greataxe.": "然后，这声音被一个对立的喊声所掩盖。\"你这个小偷小摸的家伙! 骗取我的奖金，是吗？\" 突然，一个女性半兽人接住了一个粗犷的男性人类挥舞的上勾拳。坐在附近的另外两个人类突然拔出武器来保护这个人，但在半兽人用双手大斧砍下这个人的头之前。",
	"His head topples from his shoulders and rolls toward the tap room, coming to a stop by an unoccupied bar stool.": "他的头从肩膀上掉下来，滚向自来水室，在一个无人的酒吧凳子旁停了下来。",
	"The headless body falls to its knees and begins blindly scrabbling around on the floor, searching for its head.": "无头的身体跪倒在地，开始盲目地在地上乱窜，寻找自己的头。",
	"The human combatants are three members of the Ebon Syndicate. The one looking for his head is Aren, their leader. Their foe, Jarah Blackthane is a half-orc mercenary known for her sleight of hand.": "人类的战斗人员是Ebon集团的三名成员。正在寻找他的头颅的人是他们的领袖阿伦。他们的敌人贾拉-布莱克坦（Jarah Blackthane）是一个半兽人雇佣兵，以其精湛的技艺而闻名。",
	"Most tavern patrons flee or take cover at the outbreak of the brawl.": "大多数酒馆的顾客在争吵爆发时逃跑或躲避。",
	"\"Stand down!\" a voice bellows from across the room. Bryn appears from behind the bar and picks up the head, dropping the tankard he was washing with an annoyed grunt. The head spews profanity under Bryn's arm, mostly directed at Jarah. \"That's enough out of you,\" Bryn growls, jamming the head back onto the body's shoulders. With a sound like walnuts being cracked, the head reattaches and the man stands up, throwing Jarah an impish grin. \"I'll not hear another word of it, Aren,\" Bryn says. \"Save it for the brawls if you must. At least then we can wager on your stupidity.\"": "\"退下！\"一个声音从房间对面传来。布林从吧台后面出现，拿起那颗头颅，扔下他正在洗的酒杯，恼怒地哼了一声。人头在布林的手臂下喷出脏话，大部分是针对贾拉的。\"你够了。\"布林咆哮着，把头塞回尸体的肩膀上。伴随着核桃被敲碎的声音，头颅重新接上，男人站了起来，向贾拉投去一个不怀好意的笑容。\"我不会再听你说什么了，阿仁，\"布林说。\"如果你非要这么做的话，那就留到争吵的时候吧。至少到那时我们可以就你的愚蠢行为打个赌。\"",
	"Once the brawl has subsided, Bryn pushes against the tide of patrons toward the characters, tankards of ale in hand. Bryn is a fair and hardworking innkeep who simply wishes to maintain relative peace among his patrons. An ex-adventurer, Bryn cuts an imposing figure under the ale-stained apron he wears. It is rumored that Bryn is as old as the tavern itself, though it is unclear where his allegiances lie:": "争吵平息后，布林逆着顾客的潮流向人物走去，手里拿着一罐啤酒。布林是一个公正而勤奋的旅馆老板，他只是希望在他的顾客中保持相对和平。作为一名前探险家，布林在他所穿的沾满麦芽酒的围裙下显得格外威严。有传言说，布林和酒馆本身一样古老，但不清楚他的忠诚度在哪里。",
	"\"On the house,\" Bryn mutters, placing a tankard of ale in front of you. A male dwarf on the next table over is barely visible from behind a mountain of drained tankards. He slams down his next tankard with a grunt, and calls the innkeep over. \"Watering down the ale again?\" he demands. To his own dismay, the dwarf appears entirely sober. \"You'll get used to it, Gerund.\" Bryn says.": "\"我请客。\"布林嘟囔着，把一罐啤酒放在你面前。隔壁桌子上的一个男性矮人在一堆喝光的酒罐后面几乎看不到了。他咕哝着放下下一个酒罐，并把旅馆老板叫过来。\"他要求：\"又给麦酒加水了？令他失望的是，这个侏儒似乎完全清醒了。\"你会习惯的，格伦德。\" 布林说。",
	"The dwarf rounds on the characters. \"Enjoy it while ye still can, ye'll find no small comforts ‘ere. Food tastes like ash, ale turns to water. Even Aren over there can't walk on the second floor no more. Says it's like walking through a salt marsh. But I'll not stay. Heard tell of a boy who crawled out through the attic. Whittled away at a mouse hole until it was big enough for him to slip out. Never saw ‘im again.\"": "矮人在人物上打转。\"趁你还能享受，你会发现这里的舒适度不小。食物吃起来像灰，麦酒变成了水。就连那边的阿伦也不能再在二楼行走了。他说这就像在盐沼中行走。但我不会留下来。听说有一个男孩从阁楼上爬出来。凿开了一个老鼠洞，直到它大到足以让他溜出去。再也没见过他。\"",
	"\"You'll do well not to heed Vieri's stories.\" Bryn chides. \"That bard is half-mad from Dreams Leave.\"": "\"你最好不要听从维埃里的故事。\" 布林责备道。\"那个吟游诗人因梦境离开而半疯了。\"",
	"A slim halfling boy of around 9 years old watches the party from a barstool. He carries a copy of the Tales of Etharis, a book detailing deeds of great Etharian heroes. Despite his seemingly youthful appearance, he speaks with maturity beyond his years, introducing himself as Mouse. Mouse believes the party are legendary adventurers he read about in Tales of Etharis, and enthusiastically shows the adventurers the beginning of a tale called \"The Vanishing Keep\" which bears a striking similarity to the circumstances under which the party finds themselves captive. He treats the characters with reverence and is overly keen to help the party in any way he can. He carries a wooden toy sword at his hip.": "一个大约9岁的瘦小的半身人男孩在酒吧的凳子上看着聚会。他带着一本《伊萨里斯的故事》，这是一本详细记载伊萨里斯伟大英雄事迹的书。尽管他看起来很年轻，但他说话时的成熟度超过了他的年龄，他介绍自己是老鼠。老鼠认为他们是他在《伊萨里斯的故事》中读到的传奇冒险家，并热情地向冒险家们展示了一个名为 \"消失的堡垒 \"的故事的开头，这个故事与他们发现自己被俘的情况惊人地相似。他以敬畏之心对待这些人物，并且非常热衷于以任何方式帮助他们。他的腰间挂着一把木制玩具剑。",
	"Mouse explains that he was the most recent captive-some 40 years ago. He explains that time passes differently for each patron, but to his memory, Bryn has always been the innkeep. Some occupants feel every passing second of their captivity, while others believe they have only been held for a few days. Mouse is in the latter camp, and is optimistic about escape. If questioned about the boy who escaped, Mouse believes he has seen him, \"He lives in the attic on a mountain.\" He describes the \"boy\" as a withered old man with a long grey beard who walks with a black cane. Mouse knows nothing more about him, save that he lives alone.": "老鼠解释说，他是最近的一个俘虏--大约40年前。他解释说，每个顾客的时间都不同，但在他的记忆中，布林一直是旅馆的老板。一些住客感觉到他们被囚禁的每一秒都在流逝，而其他人则认为他们只被关押了几天。老鼠属于后者，并对逃跑持乐观态度。如果被问及那个逃跑的男孩，老鼠认为他已经看到了他，\"他住在山上的阁楼上\"。他把这个 \"男孩 \"描述成一个枯萎的老人，留着长长的灰色胡子，拿着一根黑色的手杖走路。老鼠对他一无所知，只知道他独自生活。",
	"Bryn lingers nearby, eavesdropping on Mouse's conversation with the characters. He is quick to interject when Mouse brings up the attic, grabbing the boy's arm and steering him toward the kitchen with promises of honey cakes. \"Come, let's not wear out our welcome with the new guests,\" he chastises, casting a glance at the newcomers who threaten to disturb the uneasy peace he has brokered with the other patrons. He vehemently denies the existence of the \"boy\" in the attic if questioned further.": "布林在附近徘徊，偷听老鼠与人物的对话。当Mouse提到阁楼时，他很快就插话，抓住男孩的胳膊，引导他走向厨房，承诺给他蜂蜜蛋糕。\"来吧，我们不要和新来的客人耗尽我们的热情，\"他责备道，并向那些威胁要扰乱他与其他顾客达成的不安的和平的新来者投去一瞥。如果被进一步询问，他坚决否认阁楼上的 \"男孩 \"的存在。",
	"The second floor contains a suite of guest rooms. Rooms are located on either side of a hallway lit by sconces. The rooms are simply furnished, but comfortable. Bryn warns the characters not to go up to the second floor, as it is openly hostile. He tells them that if they must sleep, do so in the common room, and not in any of the beds on the second floor. The pillows have a habit of attempting to suffocate any occupant who has not paid to let the room.": "二楼有一套客房。房间位于走廊的两侧，由壁灯照明。房间里的家具很简单，但很舒适。布林警告这些人物不要上二楼，因为那里有公开的敌意。他告诉他们，如果他们必须睡觉，就在公共房间里睡，而不是在二楼的任何一张床上。枕头有一个习惯，那就是试图让任何没有付费租房的住户窒息。",
	"The door is unlocked and swings ajar easily. Behind it is another door, slightly smaller and made of different wood. It too is unlocked. Opening this door reveals another slightly smaller door, again crafted from a different wood, and so on. Opening each consecutively smaller door eventually reveals a door no larger than a thumbnail. Opening this door reveals a limitless void that stretches endlessly into the distance. Another tiny door opens across the void, and a familiar eye peers through. Any character who calls out to the eye's owner is answered by their parallel self on the other side of the door.": "这扇门没有上锁，很容易就摇开了。后面是另一扇门，略小，由不同的木材制成。它也没有上锁。打开这扇门，会看到另一扇稍小的门，也是由不同的木材制成的，以此类推。打开每扇连续的小门，最终会发现一扇不比拇指指甲大的门。打开这扇门，可以看到一个无边无际的虚空，无尽地延伸到远方。另一扇小门在虚空中打开，一只熟悉的眼睛从中窥视。任何呼唤这只眼睛的主人的角色都会被门的另一边的平行自我所回答。",
	"The door is unlocked, but something heavy rests on the other side, preventing it from being opened. Forcing it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The wooden armoire blocking the door hobbles back toward its rightful place against the far wall, setting down with a dusty sigh. The room is simply furnished, with an unmade wooden-framed double bed, and an adjoining bathroom with a claw-footed bathtub. Running water is audible.": "门没有上锁，但有重物压在另一边，阻止它被打开。迫使它打开需要成功地进行DC15力量（运动）检查。挡在门外的木制衣柜蹒跚地走回它在远处墙上的正确位置，带着灰尘的叹息坐下来。房间里的家具很简单，有一张未铺设的木质框架双人床，以及一个毗邻的带爪足浴缸的浴室。可以听到流水声。",
	"{@b {@i Bathroom.}} Closer inspection reveals the bathtub is heaped with multicoloured bubbles that never burst. They lazily drift about the room, bouncing off any surface they touch. Unless they succeed a DC 18 passive perception check, characters are too preoccupied by this to notice the trickles of water lapping over the side of the tub rapidly moving toward them. If they fail, the water seizes unwary characters by the ankles and attempts to drag them beneath the surface. Any individual caught unawares by the water must succeed a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, or be {@condition grappled} and pulled underwater. The player has one round to try and escape before the water attempts to force its way into the character's lungs, forcing them to succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have all air in their lungs replaced with water, causing them to be considered suffocating. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a successful save.": "{@b {@i Bathroom.}} 仔细观察发现，浴缸里堆满了五颜六色的气泡，这些气泡从未破灭。它们懒洋洋地在房间里飘来飘去，在它们接触的任何表面上弹跳。除非他们成功通过DC18的被动感知检查，否则角色们都太专注于此，而没有注意到在浴缸边上拍打着的涓涓细流正迅速向他们移动。如果他们失败了，水会抓住不小心的角色的脚踝，试图把他们拖到水面下。任何被水抓住的人都必须在DC15力量（竞技）或灵巧（杂技）检查中获得成功，否则就会被（%1%）拖入水下。在水试图进入角色的肺部之前，玩家有一回合的时间尝试逃跑，迫使他们成功地进行DC 15宪法救赎，否则他们肺部的所有空气都会被水取代，导致他们被视为窒息。一个生物可以在他们的回合结束时重复这个救赎动作，如果救赎成功，则结束该效果。",

The trapdoor can only be unlocked from the outside (using the key found in the trunk in Bryn's quarters), or forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check. A ladder drops down from the mouth of the attic, extending up into the dusty gloom above.": "阁楼的活板门上安装了一把可疑的新锁，使用小偷的工具，通过DC13的灵巧检查就可以撬开。活板门只能从外面打开（使用在布林宿舍的箱子里找到的钥匙），或者在成功通过DC15力量检查后强行打开。一条梯子从阁楼的口子上掉下来，一直延伸到上面的尘土飞扬的阴暗处。",
	"The attic space is a cramped garret with a sloped ceiling and a grimy, boarded-up skylight through which a few stars are visible. Boxes covered in dirty drop cloths, barrels, trunks and broken furniture litter the room under a fine layer of dust. In a back corner behind some peculiar crates labeled \"Deciduous Pearbulbs\", the characters can find a makeshift bed, recently slept in. The skylight can be forced open from the inside by prising off the boards with a successful DC 15 Strength check. It creaks in protest from years of disuse.": "阁楼空间是一个狭窄的车库，有一个倾斜的天花板和一个肮脏的、用木板封住的天窗，透过天窗可以看到几颗星星。在一层细小的灰尘下，房间里到处都是覆盖着脏布的箱子、木桶、行李箱和破损的家具。在一些标有 \"落叶梨花 \"的奇特箱子后面的一个角落里，人物可以找到一张临时床，最近睡过。通过成功的DC15力量检查，可以从里面撬开天窗的木板。由于多年来没有使用，它发出吱吱的抗议声。",
	"The skylight opens onto a vast windswept mountaintop ringed with rocky crags and fine, powdery snow. The snow is not cold to the touch, and does not melt when it settles on the characters or on the ground. The roof's slate tiles underfoot give way to a stony path winding up through the crags toward a Valikan ruin. The ruin appears to be an ancient watchtower of rotted wood, crumbling stone blocks, and a large marble plinth set into a dead tree in the centre of the courtyard.": "天窗打开后，是一个广阔的风吹草动的山顶，山顶上有岩石峭壁和细密的粉状雪。雪的触感并不冰冷，当它落在人物或地面上时并不融化。脚下的屋顶石板瓦让位于一条石子路，穿过峭壁蜿蜒而上，走向一个瓦利肯人的遗迹。这座废墟似乎是一座古老的瞭望塔，由腐烂的木头、摇摇欲坠的石块和一个巨大的大理石基座组成，镶嵌在院子中央的一棵枯树上。",
	"The party has stumbled into the sanctuary of Inorim Azeem, a powerful wizard who has been held captive by the tavern for over 300 years. The mountaintop is an extradimensional landscape of his own creation, and allows him to remain mostly immune to the draining effects of the tavern. Broken furniture is scattered around the courtyard. A {@creature stone golem} stands at attention in front of the plinth, on which sits a leather-bound journal.": "队伍偶然进入了伊诺林-阿泽姆的避难所，他是一个强大的巫师，被酒馆囚禁了300多年。山顶是他自己创造的一个超维景观，使他能够对酒馆的消耗作用保持大部分的免疫力。破碎的家具散落在院子里。一个{@creature stone golem}站在基座前，基座上放着一本皮制的日记。",
	"{@b {@i 's Ward.}} By crossing into the courtyard, the characters have disturbed a powerful protective ward placed on the ruins. The stone golem was created by Inorim, and has been instructed to guard the sanctum. It moves to attack anyone other than Inorim who comes within 15 feet of the ruin.": "{@b {@i 's Ward.}}通过进入院子，这些人物扰乱了放置在废墟上的强大保护装置。这个石雕是伊诺瑞姆创造的，并被指示守护圣殿。除了伊诺林之外，它还会攻击任何进入废墟15英尺以内的人。",
	"If the characters fight and defeat the stone golem, read the following:": "如果人物与石雕战斗并击败了石雕，请阅读下文。",
	"The stone golem topples to the ground with a disembodied clatter. A loose flagstone in the foundation of the tower rises, and out from the trapdoor climbs a gaunt wizard with a short, pointed beard emerge in tattered robes. He walks with a limp, leaning on a black staff topped with a large amber stone. He appears visibly annoyed that you have destroyed his creation.": "石头傀儡倒在地上，发出一阵失魂落魄的咔嚓声。塔楼地基中一块松动的旗杆石升起，从活板门里爬出一个身穿破烂长袍、留着短而尖的胡子的憔悴巫师。他走起路来一瘸一拐的，拄着一根黑色的法杖，上面有一块大琥珀石。他似乎对你破坏了他的创造物而明显感到恼火。",
	"If it seems that the characters will be defeated by the stone golem, read the following:": "如果看起来人物会被石像鬼打败，请阅读以下内容。",
	"A commanding voice booms across the courtyard, echoing around the mountain peaks. The voice speaks in a low, guttural tone—an archaic variant of Deep Speech. The stone golem halts its attack, and turns away from the party, lurching back toward its post with a stiff, lock-jointed gait. A gaunt wizard climbs up from beneath a loose flagstone in the foundation of the tower, leaning heavily on a black staff topped with a large amber stone. He appears visibly annoyed that you have disturbed his sanctuary.": "一个命令式的声音在院子里响起，在山峰上回荡。这个声音用低沉的声音说话--一种古老的深层语言的变体。石雕停止了它的攻击，转身离开了队伍，以僵硬的锁关节步态向它的岗位走去。一个憔悴的巫师从塔楼地基中一块松动的旗杆下面爬了上来，重重地靠在一根黑色的法杖上，上面有一块大琥珀石。他似乎很恼火，因为你打扰了他的避难所。",
	"The wizard eyes you dubiously and speaks in a gruff tone, twisting his grizzled beard between his fingers. \"About time that stone golem had something to fight other than furniture. I'm Inorim Azeem, wizard and master chronicler. And before you ask, I am not the creator of this diabolical parasite. I have been its captive for some three hundred years. I cannot tell you its purpose nor what it is, but I have discovered that it drains the vitality from those wretched souls below to sustain itself. The tavern greatly desires my powers, but through me it would enact an unspeakable evil.\"": "巫师疑惑地看着你，用粗暴的语气说话，用手指捻着他灰白的胡须。\"是时候让那只石雕有东西可打了，而不是家具。我是Inorim Azeem，巫师和编年史大师。在你问之前，我不是这个邪恶的寄生虫的创造者。我已经被它俘虏了大约三百年。我不能告诉你它的目的，也不能告诉你它是什么，但我发现它从下面那些可怜的灵魂中抽走活力来维持自己。酒馆非常渴望我的力量，但通过我，它将制定一个不可言喻的邪恶。\"",
	"A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check discerns that the wizard is honest. The stone golem serves as his protection against the malevolence of the tavern, and the piles of broken furniture were once animated by the tavern and sent to retrieve the wizard. Inorim greatly mistrusts the intentions of Bryn, who has been the innkeep since before Inorim became the tavern's captive and created the attic miniverse to sustain his powers. He advises the characters to be wary of Bryn, as he is unsure of the innkeeper's allegiances.": "成功通过DC10智慧（洞察力）检查，可以看出这个巫师是诚实的。石雕是他抵御酒馆恶意的保护物，而那些堆积如山的破烂家具曾经被酒馆赋予了灵性，并被派去救回巫师。伊诺瑞姆非常不信任布林的意图，布林在伊诺瑞姆成为酒馆的俘虏并创造了阁楼小宇宙来维持他的力量之前就已经是酒馆的老板了。他建议人物对布林保持警惕，因为他不确定旅馆老板的忠诚度。",
	"Despite his gruff manner, Inorim is relieved to see other characters who are not animated furniture sent to retrieve him. As a result of centuries spent using his powers to maintain the attic miniverse, Inorim constantly has a point of exhaustion.": "尽管他态度粗暴，但伊诺林看到其他不是动画家具的角色被派来找他时，还是松了一口气。由于几个世纪以来，伊诺瑞姆一直在使用他的力量来维持阁楼上的迷你宇宙，所以他一直有一个疲惫的点。",
	"If Inorim is healed by the characters or given information about the outside world, he is begrudgingly grateful, muttering his thanks. He offers the characters advice based on his years of careful observation of the tavern, and past escape attempts he has witnessed using the scrying spell. Inorim recalls that one previous adventurer came close to finding the seeing stone, only to be killed by the jaws of the mounted head while peering inside. He cannot leave the miniverse until the previous conduit of the tavern has been defeated.": "如果伊诺瑞姆被人物治愈或得到关于外界的信息，他就会勉强感激，并喃喃自语地表示感谢。他根据自己多年来对酒馆的仔细观察，以及过去目睹的使用窥视咒语的逃跑尝试，向人物提供建议。伊诺瑞姆回忆说，以前有一个冒险者差点就找到了透视石，但在窥视里面的时候却被骑头的大嘴咬死了。在击败酒馆的前一个管道之前，他不能离开这个迷你世界。",
	"\"The only way out is down. Down into the bedrock of this infernal parasite,\" Inorim says. \"Find the seeing stone in the mouth of the boar. It will show you the way out.\"": "\"唯一的出路是向下。下到这个地狱寄生虫的基岩中，\"伊诺瑞姆说。\"在野猪的嘴里找到那块看见的石头。它会告诉你出去的路。\"",
	"If Inorim is killed by the characters, the journal on the plinth reveals the same information. Leafing to the final page, the following is inscribed in Inorim's hand:": "如果伊诺瑞姆被这些人物杀死，基座上的日记就会显示同样的信息。翻到最后一页，下面是伊诺林的手写内容。",
	"The only way out is down. Down into the bedrock of this infernal parasite. I must take the seeing stone from the mouth of the boar. It will show the way out.": "唯一的出路是向下。跌入这地狱般的寄生虫的基岩中。我必须从野猪的嘴里拿回那块看见的石头。它将为我指明出路。",
	"Crawling back down through the skylight, the characters emerge from a door into the second-floor hallway (due to a disturbance to the rune in T8) which swings shut by itself with a loud slam. The tavern begins to shake violently. Candles in their braziers flicker out, and the tavern is plunged into unnatural darkness. The corridor begins to constrict, pressing down from above and closing in on the sides. Sconces that were previously meters away on either side of the walls must be ducked under or avoided, and drip scalding wax if bumped into in the dark. Smaller characters are able to move at normal speed, but creatures of medium size or larger treat this area as difficult terrain.": "从天窗爬回地面，人物从一扇门里出来，进入二楼的走廊（由于T8的符文受到干扰），这扇门随着一声巨响自己摇晃着关上了。酒馆开始剧烈摇晃。烛台上的蜡烛一闪一闪的，酒馆陷入了非自然的黑暗之中。走廊开始收缩，从上面压下来，向两边靠拢。以前在墙壁两侧数米之外的壁炉必须躲避或避开，如果在黑暗中被撞到，就会滴下滚烫的蜡液。体型较小的角色能够以正常速度移动，但中等体型或更大的生物则将这一区域视为困难地形。",
	"Additionally, the following changes have occured within the tavern:": "此外，酒馆内还发生了以下变化。",
	"The mimic is no longer dissuaded by food, and is openly hostile to characters, attacking those within range. It is unaffected by the warping of the tavern.": "拟态不再被食物所驱使，并且公开敌视人物，攻击范围内的人。它不受酒馆扭曲的影响。",
	"The staircase back down to the common room has inverted itself, now leading up to the enclosed ceiling. Characters must decide whether to go through the door to T4 or T5 to return to the common room before the hallway fully constricts, crushing all who remain within.": "回到公共休息室的楼梯已经倒转，现在通向封闭的天花板。角色必须决定是通过T4的门还是T5的门，在走廊完全收缩之前回到休息室，压死所有留在里面的人。",
	"This door opens into the common room. From across the room, Bryn can be seen clearing half-drained tankards and unwashed plates. He casts the characters a disapproving look as they collapse through the door, which swings shut behind them with a loud slam.": "这扇门通向公共房间。从房间的另一边，可以看到布林在清理半干的酒杯和未洗的盘子。当他们穿过这扇门时，他向这些人物投去了不赞同的目光，门在他们身后 \"砰 \"的一声关闭了。",
	"The room appears very much the same as it did before. Running water can be heard coming from the bathroom, only now a water elemental takes the place of the lethal bathwater if they have not already fought and disposed of it. Jarah's room is unaffected by the constricting walls of the hallway outside. If the characters close this door and reopen it a second time, they can see the ground floor common room beyond.": "这个房间看起来和以前非常一样。可以听到从浴室里传来的流水声，只是现在水元素取代了致命的洗澡水，如果他们还没有与之战斗并将其处理掉。贾拉的房间不受外面走廊的限制性墙壁的影响。如果人物关上这扇门，再重新打开它，他们就能看到外面的底层公共房间。",
	"The common room is the same as the characters left it. A drinking game has commenced at one of the tables, and a large crowd has gathered. Jarah and Aren sit facing one another across the table, a circle of eight full tankards between them. They loudly insult one another, much to the delight of the spectators who cheer them on. The bard, Vieri, watches the proceedings with boredom, his gaze settling on the characters. At his hip, a beaded drawstring bag full of Dreams Leave catches the firelight. Bryn likewise watches the characters as he gathers empty plates at a nearby table.": "休息室和人物离开时一样。一张桌子上已经开始了喝酒游戏，聚集了一大群人。贾拉和阿伦隔着桌子面对面坐着，他们之间有一圈八个满满的酒杯。他们大声辱骂对方，这让为他们欢呼的观众们非常高兴。吟游诗人维埃里无聊地看着这一切，他的视线落在了人物身上。在他的臀部，一个装满梦想的珠子抽绳袋被火光照亮。布林也同样看着这些人物，他在附近的桌子上收拾空盘子。",
	"Over the mantle, the mounted head continues to flicker between its varied forms (boar, black bear, crowned stag). Characters who reach into its mouth (in any form) find that a powerful set of jaws have clamped down on their hand with the force of a bear trap. Any character who reaches into the mouth must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the character takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage as the jaws clamp shut. If a character attempts to pull their hand away, a further 1 slashing damage is inflicted. The character is {@condition restrained} until the jaws are forced open. As an action, another character can pry open the jaws with a successful DC 13 Strength check.": "在地幔上，装在上面的头颅继续在其不同的形态（野猪、黑熊、有冠的雄鹿）之间闪烁着。伸手到它嘴里的角色（任何形式）都会发现，一副强大的下巴以捕熊器的力量钳住了他们的手。任何把手伸进嘴里的角色都必须做一个DC15的灵巧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，角色将受到3({@damage 1d6})的穿刺伤害，因为颚部被钳住。如果一个角色试图拉开他们的手，则会受到进一步的1次切割伤害。该角色会受到（%1%）的伤害，直到颚部被强制打开。作为一个行动，另一个角色可以通过成功的DC13力量检查来撬开钳子。",
	"{@b {@i Seeing stone.}} A {@spell detect magic} spell or similar magic reveals a powerful aura of divination magic around the mounted head over the mantle. Looking inside the mouth of the mounted head, one finds a smooth jade stone shaped like a planchette with a hole in the centre is visible. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the stone is used for finding hidden entrances within the tavern.": "{@b {@i Seeing stone.}}一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语或类似的魔法，在幔子上的装头周围显示出一个强大的占卜魔法光环。在头盔的嘴里，可以看到一块光滑的玉石，形状像一个中心有孔的弹弓。如果成功通过DC15智力（阿卡纳）检查，就会发现这块石头是用来寻找酒馆内的隐藏入口。",
	"Having retrieved the stone, characters are able to look through the hole in the centre of the stone to reveal a golden, glowing trail leading to the location of the entrance to the basement. A wooden trapdoor behind the bar is carved with a triangular notch into which the seeing stone fits snugly. If the stone is inserted into this notch, the trapdoor slams open against its hinges with a shudder, and characters can see down into the yawning darkness below. There is no ladder extending down into the gloom.": "取回石头后，人物可以通过石头中央的孔洞看到一条金色的发光小路，通往地下室的入口位置。酒吧后面的木质活板门上刻有一个三角形的凹槽，看见的石头可以紧紧地塞进去。如果把石头插入这个缺口，活板门就会颤抖着撞开铰链，人物就能看到下面巨大的黑暗。没有梯子延伸到阴暗处。",
	"To all appearances, the characters have found a subterranean exit beneath the tavern. If they go through the trapdoor, they fall through darkness and land in what appears to be the tavern's front yard. In fact, the characters have stumbled into a pocket universe beneath the tavern, in which a parallel tavern is the centrepiece of a condensed imitation of the real world above. The tavern door stands open, emitting a warm amber glow. However, there are no sounds issuing from the tavern, or from anywhere else. No wind rustles the leaves of the canopy, no calls of nocturnal animals. The night sky stretches overhead, twinkling with stars, flat and dimensionless as bright pinpoints painted on a high ceiling. The dense forest extends in either direction, thankfully bereft of werewolves.": "从表面上看，这些人物在酒馆下面找到了一个地下出口。如果他们穿过活板门，他们就会在黑暗中坠落，落在似乎是酒馆前院的地方。事实上，这些人物无意中进入了酒馆下面的一个袖珍宇宙，在那里，一个平行的酒馆是上面现实世界的浓缩模仿的中心。酒馆的门敞开着，散发着温暖的琥珀色光芒。然而，没有任何声音从酒馆或其他地方发出来。没有风吹动树冠上的树叶，没有夜间动物的叫声。夜空在头顶上延伸，闪烁着星星，平淡无奇，如同画在高高的天花板上的明亮针尖。茂密的森林向两个方向延伸，幸好没有狼人。",
	"Walking in any direction for a short duration invariably leads back to the tavern. Whenever the characters return to the tavern, the front door is always open, and the faint strumming of a lute can be heard from within. Inevitably, the characters must return to the tavern. The front door remains open as the characters enter through it into the parallel common room.": "在任何方向走一小段路，都会回到酒馆。每当人物回到酒馆时，前门总是开着的，从里面可以听到微弱的琵琶弹奏声。不可避免地，人物必须回到酒馆。当人物通过前门进入平行的公共房间时，前门一直开着。",
	"The patrons sit around the tables, moving and interacting at an imperceptibly slow speed. Some appear {@condition paralyzed} mid-drink. Others sit hunched over a game of cards, their faces frozen in concentration. Bryn stands behind the bar, motionless as he pours ale from a keg. The trickle of beer flowing into the tankard is unmoving as an icicle. Characters notice a familiar figure by the hearth who moves at a normal pace, tuning his lute: {@creature Vieri|GH} the bard.": "顾客们坐在桌子周围，以难以察觉的缓慢速度移动和互动。有些人出现在{@condition paralyzed}饮酒中。另一些人则蜷缩着身子坐在牌局上，脸上的表情凝重。布林站在吧台后面，一动不动地从酒桶中倒出啤酒。流入酒罐的啤酒像冰柱一样一动不动。角色们注意到壁炉旁一个熟悉的身影，他以正常的速度移动，调着他的琵琶：（%%1%）吟游诗人。",
	"You see that the armchair by the hearth has been turned around to face the entrance. In it sits the bard. He strokes his chin thoughtfully. His dark eyes betray nothing of his thoughts. \"Vieri Barboro, at your service,\" he bows with a flourish. \"Bard, master conjurer, and lord of this realm.\"": "你看到壁炉边的扶手椅已经转过来面向入口。吟游诗人就坐在里面。他若有所思地抚摸着下巴。他的黑眼睛没有透露出他的想法。\"维埃里-巴博罗，为您效劳。\"他面带微笑地鞠了一躬。\"吟游诗人，魔法大师，以及这个王国的领主。\"",
	"A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check discerns that the bard is lying. While time and space appear to bend around him, his body jerks and convulses at odd intervals, almost as if he is not in full control of his actions. The bard disappears from his place by the fireside, and reappears behind the characters, walking across the bartop. He reaches behind the bar for Bryn's sword, balancing the blade on a finger. The sword doubles over like a magician's spoon trick. Vieri continues:": "成功通过DC15智慧（洞察力）检查，可以看出吟游诗人在说谎。当时间和空间似乎在他周围弯曲时，他的身体以奇怪的间隔抽搐着，几乎就像他没有完全控制自己的行为一样。吟游诗人从他在炉边的位置上消失了，然后重新出现在人物的后面，走过酒桌。他将手伸向吧台后面的布林的剑，将剑身放在一个手指上平衡。剑像魔术师的勺子把戏一样翻转过来。维埃里继续说。",
	"\"I offered you every comfort; food, companionship, an unending flow of ale. I asked very little in return. Vitality is a small price for eternal contentment, no? And yet, you have proven quite a troubling meal to digest.\"": "\"我向你提供了所有的安慰；食物、伴侣、源源不断的酒水。我只要求很少的回报。生命力对于永恒的满足来说是个小代价，不是吗？然而，事实证明，你是一顿令人烦恼的大餐，难以消化。\"",

	"Combat starts with the tavern already having cast animate object on the bar before the players arrived. The bar bench rips out of the floorboards, throwing Bryn aside, and he topples to the floor like a dressmaker's dummy. The bar twists and writhes like a snake, poised to strike the characters. It comes down with a heavy crash that shakes the foundations of the tavern. The other furniture likewise becomes animated. The books on the bookshelf amass into a swirling flock to knock unwary characters {@condition prone}, a mop and bucket even join in the fray-the mop flies through the air like a jousting lance, while the bucket attempts to trip characters underfoot.": "战斗开始时，在玩家到达之前，酒馆已经对酒吧施放了 \"有生命的物体\"。吧台的长凳从地板上裂开，把布林扔到一边，他像个裁缝的假人一样倒在地上。酒吧像一条蛇一样扭动着，准备袭击这些人物。它下来时发出沉重的撞击声，震动了酒馆的地基。其他家具也同样变得生动起来。书架上的书堆积成一个漩涡，敲打着不小心的人物（%0%），拖把和水桶甚至加入了这场战斗--拖把像长矛一样在空中飞舞，而水桶则试图绊倒脚下的人物。",
	"Killing Vieri will end the taverns effects on the animated furniture. When he dies, his body crumbles into a fine black powder that falls through the knots in the floorboards.": "杀死维埃里将结束酒馆对动画家具的影响。当他死后，他的身体会碎成细小的黑色粉末，通过地板上的结点落下。",

Without a conduit for its power, the tavern will drift anchorless through time and space, finding new prey to satiate its gluttony.\"": "\"幸会，\"你身后一个熟悉的声音说。伊诺瑞姆蹒跚地走下楼梯，朝你走来，沉重地倚靠着他的法杖。\"一个卑鄙的生物，那个吟游诗人。我从来不喜欢他。你似乎已经证明了你的麻烦超过了你对这个生物的价值，而这个庞然大物确实喜欢轻松的一餐。至于我，我将留在后面。没有了它的力量管道，酒馆将在时间和空间中无锚地漂流，寻找新的猎物来满足它的贪婪。\"",
	"Whether or not Inorim survived, continue from here. The tavern creaks and groans as if the supporting beams will collapse at any moment. Portraits fall from the walls with the sound of shattering glass.": "无论伊诺林是否幸存，从这里继续。酒馆发出吱吱的呻吟声，仿佛支撑的梁柱随时都会倒塌。画像从墙上掉下来，发出玻璃碎裂的声音。",
	"The mounted head crashes to the floor, flickering rapidly between its varied forms. The remaining patrons collapse, rigid and unmoving. Furniture begins to warp and buckle, and the remaining books hurl themselves from the bookshelf and scatter across the room. Kegs of ale burst open in a cascade of foam. The very fabric of the tavern appears to warp and twist around Inorim, who raises a hand in farewell.": "装载的头颅坠落在地上，在其不同的形式之间迅速闪烁。其余的顾客倒下了，僵硬地一动不动。家具开始扭曲和倒扣，剩下的书从书架上扔下，散落在房间里。一桶桶的麦酒在一串串的泡沫中爆裂开来。酒馆的结构似乎在伊诺林身边扭曲起来，伊诺林举手告别。",
	"Characters who attempt to rescue the NPCs find that the latter's weight has doubled in the tavern's final attempt to retain its more docile captives. Characters must succeed at a DC 10 Strength check for each NPC they attempt to save.": "试图营救NPC的角色发现后者的体重增加了一倍，这是酒馆为了留住更多温顺的俘虏所做的最后努力。角色必须对他们试图拯救的每个NPC进行DC10的力量检查，才能成功。",

	"In one heaving rumble, you are launched up through the hearth and out through the chimney back into the real world, landing with a thud by the carriageway where you first saw the tavern. You are covered in soot and disheveled from your less than graceful exit. The door to the tavern slams shut, and the tavern folds in on itself, vanishing from the Material Plane with a loud crack.": "轰隆一声，你被从壁炉里推出来，通过烟囱回到现实世界，砰地一声落在你第一次看到酒馆的车道上。你浑身都是烟灰，因为你的离开并不优雅，所以衣衫不整。酒馆的门被关上了，酒馆折叠在自己身上，随着一声巨响从物质界消失了。",
	"Any NPCs who have been rescued look around in shock, similarly covered in soot. They express their heartfelt thanks, and sheepishly ask where (and when) they have found themselves. Some, having been able to see the conflict, but immobile, may even believe that this is another of the tavern's illusions, and gaze about furtively, as if expecting Vieri to reappear at any moment. NPCs bid farewell to the adventurers, and ask for directions to the nearest town. Through the trees, the lights of a small village glimmer. The sound of dogs barking, and the distant murmur of civilisation, can be heard.": "任何获救的NPC都震惊地环顾四周，同样被烟尘所覆盖。他们表示由衷的感谢，并羞涩地问他们在哪里（以及什么时候）发现自己。有些人虽然看到了冲突，但却无法动弹，他们甚至可能相信这是酒馆的另一个幻觉，并鬼鬼祟祟地四处张望，仿佛在期待维埃里随时会再次出现。NPC向冒险家们告别，并询问去最近的城镇的方向。透过树林，一个小村庄的灯光闪烁着。可以听到狗的叫声和远处文明的杂音。",
	"Along with everything the players entered with, the tavern spewed out other items that it thought were theirs, wanting to be rid of them completely.

	"{@b Nell}, a strange young woman who wanders in the Pit, apparently knows many of its shortcuts and secrets. She is one of Skellna's alter egos.": "{@b Nell}，一个奇怪的年轻女人，她在坑中游荡，显然知道许多捷径和秘密。她是Skellna的另一个自我。",
	"{@b Kalseln}, also called \"Kals\" is an elusive sorceress leading a band of thieves that recently appeared in the Pit called the Grey Rogues. She is actually another of Skellna's alternate identities.": "{@b Kalseln}，也叫 \"卡尔斯\"，是一个难以捉摸的女巫，领导着最近在坑中出现的一个叫做灰色罗格的盗贼团。她实际上是斯凯尔纳的另一个替代身份。",
	"{@b Eldhyl Archbane}, heir to the noble Archbane family, has fled his family's rich estate in an attempt to escape the truth of the Archbane family's dark deeds. He got addicted to Dreams Leaves, and was shortly afterwards captured by Falkia, with whom he apparently entertains an intimate relationship.": "{@b Eldhyl Archbane}，贵族Archbane家族的继承人，为了逃避Archbane家族黑暗行为的真相，他逃离了他家的富饶庄园。他沉迷于梦之叶，不久后被法尔克亚抓获，他显然与法尔克亚有着亲密的关系。",
	"{@b {@creature Falkia Coldheart|GH}} is a vampire venerated by the Blood Daggers, cultists who terrorize the Pit in her name. She has grown addicted to the Dreams Leaves addicts' blood, and has recently chosen Nell's brother as her partner.": "{@b {@creature Falkia Coldheart|GH}}是一个被 \"血匕首 \"敬仰的吸血鬼，这些邪教分子以她的名义恐吓坑道。她已经对梦之叶瘾君子的血液上瘾，最近选择了内尔的弟弟作为她的伙伴。",
	"{@b Lieutenant Doze} is a {@creature knight} of the Archbane guard, in charge of maintaining peace in the Pit, or more accurately in charge of preventing whatever happens in the Pit from spreading outside of it. He has many scars, including a huge one on the side of his mouth that seems to be the cause of his strong accent. He holds his share of secrets, the greatest one being that he controls the smuggling of Dreams Leaves into the Pit.": "{@b Lieutenant Doze}是大本营卫队的{@creature knight}，负责维护坑内的和平，或者更准确地说，负责防止坑内发生的任何事情蔓延到坑外。他有很多伤疤，包括他嘴边的一个巨大的伤疤，这似乎是他强烈的口音的原因。他有自己的秘密，其中最大的秘密是他控制着梦之叶的走私，使其进入坑道。",
	"{@b Skeinig} is an alchemist of the Archbane family. His laboratory is not far from the Muck Gate and the Sticky Stew. He is handsomely paid for his silent obedience in creating the Dreams Leaves for the profits of the Archbane family, but his weakness is his love for carnal pleasure...": "{@b Skeinig}是Archbane家族的一名炼金术士。他的实验室离粪门和粘稠的炖肉不远。他为了阿奇班家族的利益，默默地服从于创造梦之叶的工作，得到了丰厚的报酬，但他的弱点是喜欢肉体的快乐......",
	"{@b Bedlaf}, a poor man used by various gangs to deliver missives and secrets.": "{@b Bedlaf}，一个被各帮派用来传递信物和秘密的可怜人。",
	"After harsh travels across wastelands, the characters have finally reached the town of Runeheim where they intend to take a well-deserved rest. As they don't know the town very well and they will most likely find themselves in the least expensive inn—the Sticky Stew. The Sticky Stew is near the Muck Gate, a guarded gate inside the town that controls comings and goings from the slum known as the Pit.": "经过在荒原上的艰苦旅行，这些人物终于到达了Runeheim镇，他们打算在那里好好休息一下。由于他们对这个镇子不是很了解，他们很可能会在最便宜的旅馆--Sticky Stew中找到自己。黏糊糊的炖肉店在泥土门附近，这是镇上的一个守卫门，控制着来自被称为 \"坑 \"的贫民窟的来往。",
	"The adventure starts while the characters are having a drink in the inn's common room. A group of bruisers sit at the table next to them, and shortly they are hailed by another who just came in, seemingly drunk. He-seemingly by accident-faints on one of the characters, causing their drink to spill on one of the bruisers, and precipitating a general brawl. After the brawl, the characters realize that the gentlemen who started it has vanished. The next morning they notice that one of their bags has been exchanged with someone else's.": "冒险开始时，人物正在旅馆的公共休息室里喝酒。一群布鲁斯人坐在他们旁边的桌子上，不久，他们被另一个刚进来的人叫住，他似乎喝醉了。他--似乎是个意外--暗示了其中一个角色，导致他们的酒洒在了一个布鲁斯人身上，并引发了一场大混战。争吵过后，这些人物意识到挑起争吵的绅士已经消失了。第二天早上，他们发现自己的一个包被换成了别人的。",
	"Situated near the town entrance and just outside the Pit, the Sticky Stew (called \"the Stink Eye Stew\" by its detractors) is a low-grade inn that owes most of its business to low prices and its proximity to a town gate. Nonetheless the Sticky Stew is a place where people from all over cross paths, looking for a cheap meal or a cheap room after a harsh journey.": "黏糊糊的炖菜（被其反对者称为 \"臭眼炖菜\"）位于小镇入口附近，是一家低档次的客栈，其大部分业务归功于低价和靠近小镇大门的位置。尽管如此，Sticky Stew是一个来自各地的人交汇的地方，他们在艰苦的旅程后寻找一顿便宜的饭菜或一个便宜的房间。",
	"Across the square from the Sticky Stew, a huge gate blocks entrance to the rough area called the Pit. That gate once was magnificent, but decades of neglect have uglied it to the point that it is now called the Muck Gate. The name also suits it because all the towns filth, thrown into the river running through it, backs up beside the gate until the sluice is periodically opened, releasing the flow on into the Pit. The Muck Gate is only opened during the day, and it is constantly guarded by a group of 4 {@creature guard||guards} led by Lieutenant Doze, a huge scarred warrior built like a brick wall.": "在粘稠炖肉的广场对面，一扇巨大的门挡住了通往被称为 \"坑 \"的粗糙区域的入口。那扇门曾经很宏伟，但几十年的忽视使它变得丑陋，以至于它现在被称为 \"垃圾门\"。这个名字也很适合它，因为所有城镇的污物都被扔进了流经它的河里，堆积在大门旁边，直到水闸被定期打开，将水流释放到坑里。粪门只在白天打开，并由Doze中尉领导的4人小组（%0%）不断守卫，他是一个巨大的伤疤战士，身材像砖墙一样。",
	"The action takes place in Runeheim, and mostly in the rough area called the {@b Pit}, a slum crippled by a drug called the Dreams Leaves. People addicted to it experience enveloping hallucinations in which all their wishes are fulfilled. Addicts will do anything for it, and the situation has degenerated to the point where a vampire appeared and took control of the Pit.": "行动发生在Runeheim，主要是在被称为{@b Pit}的粗糙地区，这是一个被一种叫做 \"梦之叶 \"的药物所毁坏的贫民窟。对这种药物上瘾的人，会出现笼罩性的幻觉，在这种幻觉中，他们所有的愿望都会得到满足。瘾君子会为了它做任何事，情况已经恶化到一个吸血鬼出现并控制了这个坑的程度。",
	"Falkia by name, the vampire quickly established a gang called the Blood Daggers whose members monitor the drug addicts, bringing them to dispensaries where they are taken care of. There the addicts are exploited as blood providers in exchange for their daily dose. Indeed, as they are addicted to the Dreams Leaves, Falkia has grown addicted to the blood of the addicts.": "吸血鬼的名字叫Falkia，他很快建立了一个名为 \"血匕首 \"的团伙，其成员监视吸毒者，把他们带到药房，在那里他们得到照顾。在那里，吸毒者被剥削为血液提供者，以换取他们每天的剂量。事实上，由于他们对 \"梦之叶 \"上瘾，法尔克亚也对上瘾者的血液上瘾。",
	"Despite the questionable motives of the Blood Daggers, this state of affairs at least stabilized the spread of the drug in the Pit for a time. Things have escalated again recently with the appearance of a new gang. Called the Grey Rogues, and led by a powerful but elusive sorceress known under the name of Kals, they attacked several of the Blood Daggers' key dispensaries. Although the Grey Rogues seem to be making a play for control of the drug trade, their true motives are unclear.": "尽管 \"血匕首 \"的动机值得怀疑，但这种状况至少在一段时间内稳定了毒品在矿坑的传播。最近，随着一个新帮派的出现，事情又升级了。他们被称为 \"灰色罗格\"，由一个强大但难以捉摸的女巫领导，以卡尔斯（Kals）为名，袭击了 \"血刀 \"的几个重要药房。尽管灰袍人似乎在为控制毒品贸易而努力，但他们的真正动机还不清楚。",
	"Approximately in the centre of the Pit, an old bridge crosses the river. Due to the bowl-like depression in which the Pit is situated, this bridge and the area around are flooded almost every time the sluice gate is opened by the guards at the Muck Gate. Those unlucky enough to find themselves on the bridge at the time risk drowning, hence the name of Drowned Bridge. Some distance further on, the river disappears through a small tunnel that crosses the town's ancient outer wall.": "大约在矿坑的中心，有一座老桥横跨河流。由于矿坑位于一个碗状的凹陷中，几乎每当粪门的守卫打开水闸时，这座桥和周围的区域都会被淹没。那些不幸在桥上发现自己的人有被淹死的危险，因此被称为 \"淹死桥\"。再往前走一段距离，河水穿过一条小隧道消失在小镇的古老外墙。",
	"One block from the Drowned Bridge, one can find an alley stuck between high dilapidated buildings. Almost every day, a market is held there, allowing those who have a few coins left to buy spoiled food and other articles that merchants want to get rid of. Rats are everywhere in the Pit, and it's not unusual to find a dead one \"included\" in the merchandise. That's why many people call the place the Dead Rat Market.": "在离淹没之桥一个街区的地方，人们可以找到一条卡在高大破旧建筑物之间的小巷。几乎每天都有一个市场在那里举行，让那些剩下几个硬币的人购买变质的食物和其他商人想要处理的物品。老鼠在坑里随处可见，在商品中 \"包括 \"一只死老鼠是很平常的事。这就是为什么许多人把这个地方称为死老鼠市场。",
	"On what could be considered as the main street of the Pit stands a long, flat building, faded and covered with rust. Once glorious and shining, its frontispiece is now half dismantled, but the title is still there bar one letter-passersby are left to wonder whether it is the \"Last Hope\" or the \"Lost Hope\". Those who know what disease troubles the patients of that cursed place favor the latter version. Inside the dispensary, under the violent control of the Blood Daggers, people addicted to the Dreams Leaves are kept in a desperate state of continued intoxication, delivering a daily blood pouch for the vampire Falkia until their dying breath.": "在可以被认为是矿坑的主要街道上，矗立着一座长长的、平坦的建筑，已经褪色并布满锈迹。它的正面图案曾经辉煌而闪亮，现在已被拆掉了一半，但标题仍然在那里，只有一个字母--路人不禁要问，它是 \"最后的希望 \"还是 \"失去的希望\"。那些知道那个被诅咒的地方的病人得了什么病的人赞成后一种说法。在药房内，在 \"血匕首 \"的暴力控制下，沉迷于 \"梦之叶 \"的人被保持在持续中毒的绝望状态中，每天为吸血鬼法尔克亚提供一个血袋，直到他们死亡。",
	"On the far slope of the depression that shapes the Pit, clinging to the base of Runeheim's main wall, lies a ruined manor, yet another vestige of a prestigious but long-forgotten past. Abandoned for centuries, it is now under the control of the Blood Daggers and their mistress, the vampire {@creature Falkia Coldheart|GH}. The only access to the manor is a straight and steep road that makes it near impossible to approach without being spotted. This further reinforces the manor's dominant position. Though it used to simply be called the Ruined Manor, it is now known as the Blood Manor.": "在形成坑道的洼地的远处山坡上，紧贴着Runeheim主墙的底部，坐落着一个废墟般的庄园，这是一个著名但早已被遗忘的过去的又一遗迹。它被遗弃了几个世纪，现在由血匕首和他们的女主人，吸血鬼（%0%）控制。进入庄园的唯一通道是一条笔直而陡峭的道路，几乎不可能在不被发现的情况下接近。这进一步加强了该庄园的主导地位。虽然它以前只是被称为废墟庄园，但现在被称为血色庄园。",
	"While the switched bag looks indistinguishable from the one which was taken, a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a detect magic spell reveals that it was actually a different bag disguised by an illusion spell. If the characters don't realize the spell's existence, it will dissipate after some time (at the GM's discretion), revealing that magic was at work.": "虽然被调换的包看起来和被拿走的包没有区别，但通过DC20智力（阿卡纳）检查或探测魔法的咒语，可以发现这实际上是一个由幻觉咒语伪装的不同的包。如果人物没有意识到咒语的存在，它将在一段时间后消散（由GM决定），显示出魔法的作用。",
	"The bag contains a mysterious device, and nothing else. A closer look gives details: a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals scratched writing on some parts of the device, and a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check tells that it works with magic and seems to be assembled from pieces that were not initially designed for it.": "袋子里有一个神秘的装置，除此之外没有其他东西。仔细观察可以发现一些细节：通过DC10智慧（感知）检查可以发现装置的某些部分有划痕，通过DC18智力（阿卡纳）检查可以发现它是用魔法工作的，而且似乎是由最初没有设计的部件组装而成的。",
	"The device is actually a Dreams Leaves converter, a magical tool for rendering Dreams Leaves into an edible powder.": "这个装置实际上是一个梦之叶转换器，一个将梦之叶渲染成可食用粉末的神奇工具。",
	"Questioning Torven, the innkeeper, reveals that the thief-or the blunderer-is the drunk lad who started the brawl, a man called Bedlaf. By digging deeper, the characters can also learn that he is used as a mule by gangs of the Pit.": "询问旅店老板托尔文时，他发现小偷--或者说诈骗者--就是那个挑起争吵的醉酒少年，一个叫贝德拉夫的人。通过深入调查，人物还可以了解到他被坑里的帮派当作骡子使用。",

	"Once in the Pit, the characters meet a girl, Nell, who seems interested in helping them in exchange for a few coins.

	"In the course of talking to the characters, she tells them that Bedlaf was commissioned by the Grey Rogues, a gang of thieves that recently took control of some businesses in the Pit.

A DC15 Charisma check is the fastest way to ask the right questions and find the Grey Rogues.": "在与人物交谈的过程中，她告诉他们贝德拉夫是受灰袍人委托的，灰袍人是一个盗贼团伙，最近控制了坑里的一些企业。她把他们引向死鼠市场，认为这是他们找到灰袍人成员的最佳地点，方法是威胁、说服或通过观察。使用DC15魅力检查是问出正确问题并找到灰袍人的最快方法。",

	"Upon arrival at the Lost Hope Dispensary, the characters witness a Dreams Leaves addict being assaulted and kidnapped by a group of Blood Daggers.

He won't say his name, though, and just follows the Blood Dagger escort.": "船长会从人物那里收到这个装置，并给人物一封密封的信作为回报。如果被问及贝德拉夫，他只会说（实话实说），他从未听说过他。这时，另一个人物从药房里出来（Eldhyl），他的举止似乎与护送他的粗暴奴才们格格不入。不过他不说自己的名字，只是跟着血匕首的护卫。",

	"Unless they choose option 2 or get the keys, the characters will have to pick the door lock with thieves' tools, making a DC 13 Dexterity check.

The priestesses live mostly in selfsufficiency, and only receive a few supplies from the village in exchange for their vineyard's yield and weekly sermons at the village chapel.": "在湖的东南端，在一个高高的孤立的岬角上，矗立着一个曾经很壮观的精灵圣地。几十年的忽视使它处于摇摇欲坠的失修状态，但它现在是慷慨的修女们的家，她们是当地的一个宗教团体，以胡戈-勒-热内卢爵士的名义照顾这个圣地。女祭司们的生活大多自给自足，只从村里得到一些物资，以换取她们葡萄园的产量和每周在村里的小教堂讲道。",
	"A long time ago, before the founding of Charneault Kingdom, some elves populated the area that would become the Lake of the Twin Waters. At that time, there was no lake, only the two rivers, hence the name Caer Melinei or \"the land of the twin rivers\". The elves had built a small village on both sides of the northern river, with a beautiful bridge spanning the river's breadth. They lived there for a long time, but were finally forced to abandon it under the pressure of human expansion. Humans settled in the village for some time, but today what remains of it lies in ruins or has been engulfed by the waters of the lake.": "很久以前，在查尼奥特王国建立之前，一些精灵在后来成为双水湖的地区居住。那时，没有湖，只有两条河，因此被称为Caer Melinei或 \"双河之地\"。精灵们在北河的两边建了一个小村庄，有一座美丽的桥横跨河面。他们在那里生活了很长时间，但在人类扩张的压力下，最终被迫放弃了它。人类在村子里定居了一段时间，但今天它的遗迹已经变成了废墟，或者被湖水吞没了。",
	"One of the rare elven buildings that has stood the test of time is the high tower on the western point of the centre island of the lake. It was probably used as a watchtower by the elves back when they lived in the area, but nowadays it is only inhabited by an old hermit. The centre island itself is filled with hostile plant life.": "经得起时间考验的罕见的精灵建筑之一是位于湖中心岛屿西侧的高塔。早在精灵们居住在这一地区时，它可能被用作瞭望塔，但如今它只被一个老隐士居住着。中心岛本身充满了敌对的植物生命。",
	"While walking on the Royal Road, the characters witness an apparition of the Blood Knight, who slaughters a small merchant convoy at the crossroads leading to the village of Bonneseaux. There's a heavy, dark mist all around and they lose sight of the knight. Whatever their reaction, they are surprised at the crime scene by the appearance of Lucius Balder, the reeve.": "在皇家大道上行走时，这些人物目睹了血腥骑士的幻影，他在通往Bonneseaux村的十字路口屠杀了一个小商队。四周弥漫着浓重的黑雾，他们失去了骑士的踪迹。无论他们的反应如何，他们在犯罪现场都被吕修斯-巴尔德的出现所惊讶。",
	"He is escorted by 20 militia guards journeying from a larger town two days from Bonneseaux. The characters are accused of the crime, arrested, and brought to the village to face trial. The characters are granted a chance to argue their innocence (and if they defend themselves poorly, testimonies fromlocals about previous apparition sightings could assist in proving their innocence). The reeve is a pragmatic man, and decides to negotiate a deal with the characters that also benefits him. Their wealth is seized, and they have to investigate the Blood Knight in order to have it returned to them in full.": "他由20名民兵护送，从距离Bonneseaux两天的一个较大的城镇出发。这些人物被指控犯罪、逮捕，并被带到村里接受审判。这些人物有机会为自己的清白辩护（如果他们为自己辩护得不好，当地人提供的关于以前看到幽灵的证词可以帮助证明他们的清白）。酋长是个务实的人，他决定与这些人物进行谈判，这也对他有利。他们的财富被没收了，他们必须调查血腥骑士，以便将财富全部归还他们。",
	"When the adventure starts, only two apparitions of the Blood Knight have been reported, with five casualties, including two militia soldiers, and two missing persons. This was enough for the local guardroom to send a distress message to the town of Vertechutes, who in return sent the reeve Balder with a small troop to settle the situation.": "当冒险开始时，只有两个血骑士的幻影被报告，有五个人伤亡，包括两个民兵，还有两个人失踪。这足以让当地的警卫室向韦特库特镇发出求救信息，作为回报，韦特库特镇派出执政官巴尔德带着一支小部队来解决这个问题。",
	"During their investigation, the Blood Knight randomly appears, attacking either playable characters or NPCs at your discretion. Feel free to adjust the frequency and targets of these encounters to the party's situation. The essential element is to provide occasions to gather information about the Blood Knight and to build tension. During these encounters, the Blood Knight might be slain by the characters, but the ghostly knight will reappear shortly afterwards.": "在他们的调查过程中，血腥骑士会随机出现，由你决定攻击可玩的角色或NPC。你可以根据党的情况自由调整这些遭遇的频率和目标。基本要素是提供机会收集有关血腥骑士的信息，并制造紧张气氛。在这些遭遇战中，血腥骑士可能会被人物杀死，但幽灵般的骑士会在不久之后再次出现。",
	"At first, Ymdrin will not try to intervene in the characters' investigation. Indeed, their struggles with the Blood Knight serve his interests insofar as they force the cursed knight to use the Spirit's nature and thus weaken it. However, when the characters understand that the knight has been cursed, and start gathering the cure components, Ymdrin has no choice but to try to stop them. To do so, he makes use of the Dark Mist to summon evil creatures that appear with the Blood Knight and fight alongside him, thus making the encounters more dangerous and increasing tension as the story advances.": "起初，Ymdrin不会试图干预人物的调查。事实上，他们与血骑士的斗争符合他的利益，因为他们迫使被诅咒的骑士使用精神的本质，从而削弱了它。然而，当人物了解到骑士已经被诅咒，并开始收集治疗成分时，伊姆德林别无选择，只能试图阻止他们。为此，他利用黑雾召唤邪恶的生物，这些生物与血骑士一起出现，与他并肩作战，从而使遭遇战更加危险，并随着故事的推进而增加紧张感。",
	"Ymdrin needs the Dark Mist to cover the lake in order to use the Spirit's power to summon dark creatures. The Dark Mist started to cover the region a few weeks before the first appearance of the Blood Knight. It hangs low over the lake and its surroundings most of the time, but sometimes there's a break and an area is momentarily free from the Dark Mist's oppressive presence. This in an important factor in the encounters, especially once characters understand that without the Dark Mist, any creature passing through it gets severely weakened or even {@condition incapacitated}. Feel free to use it to adjust the difficulty of the adventure for your players, for example by triggering a respite in the Dark Mist if the characters' are close to death. On the contrary, if they are finding gameplay too easy, the GM may use the Dark Mist to introduce additional creatures.": "伊姆德林需要黑雾覆盖湖面，以便利用精神的力量来召唤黑暗生物。黑暗迷雾在血骑士第一次出现的几周前就开始覆盖这个地区。它大部分时间都低垂在湖泊及其周围地区，但有时会出现中断，某个地区会暂时摆脱黑雾的压迫。这在遭遇战中是一个重要的因素，特别是一旦角色明白没有黑雾，任何经过黑雾的生物都会被严重削弱，甚至是（%0%）。你可以自由地使用它来为你的玩家调整冒险的难度，例如，如果人物接近死亡，就可以在黑暗之雾中触发一个喘息的机会。相反，如果他们觉得游戏太容易了，GM可以用黑暗之雾来引入额外的生物。",
	"The first reported attack from the Blood Knight happened near the fisherman's camp at the mouth of the northwestern river. Once there, the characters meet a few hunters and fishermen, who have no choice but to keep fishing on the lake to feed their families. But another character is present, Daelron the elven bard, who supposedly came to help lift the fishermen's spirits. Further questioning reveals that he came by his own volition.": "据报道，血骑士的第一次袭击发生在西北河口的渔民营地附近。一旦到了那里，人物就会遇到一些猎人和渔民，他们别无选择，只能继续在湖上捕鱼以养家糊口。但另一个人物也在场，他就是精灵吟游诗人代尔隆，据说他是来帮助渔民振作精神的。进一步询问后发现，他是自愿来的。",

	"A dying or severely injured victim describes the knight as an \"unkillable demon\" and confirms the Blood Knight's operational mode.": "一个濒临死亡或严重受伤的受害者将骑士描述为 \"无法杀死的恶魔\"，并证实了血腥骑士的行动模式。",
	"That otherworldly nature of the knight is confirmed when they encounter the Blood Knight. After the first fight, they see the corpse of the knight fall to pieces, dissolving into a filthy mix of blood, mud, and dark water. The next time the Blood Knight reappears, the characters should understand that he is of a different nature than other living beings.": "当他们遇到血色骑士时，骑士的这种超凡脱俗的性质得到了证实。在第一次战斗之后，他们看到骑士的尸体摔成了碎片，溶入了血、泥和黑水的肮脏混合物中。下次血腥骑士再次出现时，人物应该明白他与其他生物的性质不同。",
	"The Blood Knight speaks in a strange voice, as if it were drowning and speaking at the same time, so understanding his words requires a successful DC 12 {@skill Perception} check.

	"After some time spent investigating and encountering the Blood Knight, the party has probably guessed that the Blood Knight and Ser Hugues are the same entity, and that something unnatural is afoot.

However, he has a small book called \"A Small Treatise of Ichthyology Applied to Changing Waters of the Vertechutes Region\" that the characters can find after a successful DC15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. Reading it reveals a bit of the lake's history; it was not always a lake, but a pair of rivers with a small elven settlement on the northern bank. Due to the rising water levels, the humans who settled after the elves quickly abandoned the area between the rivers and created a new village called Bonneseaux.": "书商Arthus没有关于魔法或任何其他形式的奥术知识的书籍。然而，他有一本小书，叫做 \"A Small Treatise of Ichthyology Applied to Changing Waters of the Vertechutes Region\"，人物在成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查后可以找到它。阅读它可以了解到湖泊的一些历史；它并不总是一个湖泊，而是一对河流，在北岸有一个小的精灵定居点。由于水位上升，在精灵之后定居的人类很快就放弃了河流之间的区域，建立了一个新的村庄，叫做Bonneseaux。",

	"From its deep and forbidding forests, where horrible beasts lurk, to the hulking and impenetrable mountains ranges where lost legacies lie, the landscape of Etharis is formidable. However, the true monsters of this land can be found in the degenerating cities of old, where humanity clings to survival.": "从潜伏着可怕野兽的深邃禁忌的森林，到埋藏着失落遗产的巨大而难以逾越的山脉，Etharis的风景是可怕的。然而，这片土地上真正的怪物可以在堕落的古老城市中找到，那里的人类在为生存而努力。",

	"Before embarking in this unforgiving land, it is important to establish several defining features of Etharis and the Grim Hollow setting.": "在踏上这片无情的土地之前，重要的是要确定伊萨里斯和狰狞空地的几个决定性特征。",
	"Large swaths of Etharis are shrouded in darkness, supernatural and otherwise. In the farthest north the sun is hidden half the year in the natural progression of seasons. It's no surprise, either, that the deep halls of the dwarves are plunged in darkness. But the darkness shrouding the land of Ostoya is more sinister and magical in origin, and in the forests of the Charneault Kingdom, the dense mist that covers the land is the work of benign spirits—or at least spirits that bend to the will of mortals, for good and evil. The people of all these lands have adapted to a hostile environment. Punishing storms are frequent across the land, foreshadowed by howling winds and then drenching rain. Where the sun never dries the ground, mud is a constant fact of life. The crops that grow are strange and bitter. For most people, there is no safety outside the radius of a torch's glow.": "Etharis的大片土地被笼罩在黑暗中，无论是超自然的还是其他的。在最北边的地方，太阳在季节的自然进程中一年中有一半时间被隐藏起来。这也不奇怪，矮人的深宫也陷入了黑暗。但是，笼罩在奥斯托亚大陆上的黑暗在起源上更加险恶和神奇，而在查诺王国的森林里，覆盖在土地上的浓雾是良性的精神--至少是屈从于凡人意志的精神，为善为恶。所有这些土地上的人们已经适应了一个恶劣的环境。惩罚性的风暴在这片土地上频繁出现，先是狂风呼啸，然后是大雨倾盆。在太阳从未晒干的地方，泥浆是生活中一个永恒的事实。生长的农作物是奇怪而苦涩的。对大多数人来说，在手电筒的光亮半径之外没有安全。",
	"Civilization dot through the land as islands of light surrounded by the unforgiving terrain of shadowy forests, rough mountainscapes, and sinking bogs. Travellers are often met with suspicious gazes by locals who have never left the isolation of their home village.": "文明作为光的岛屿点缀在这片土地上，周围是阴暗的森林、粗糙的山地和下沉的沼泽等无情的地形。旅行者经常受到当地人怀疑的目光，他们从未离开过与世隔绝的家乡。",
	"Relentless threats assault humanity. Vicious creatures hunt wandering children and armed travellers alike, many of whom are never heard from again. Sinister forces seek to twist mankind's nature to their whims, leaving them forever changed.": "无情的威胁袭击了人类。邪恶的生物猎杀流浪的儿童和武装的旅行者，其中许多人再也没有消息。邪恶的力量试图将人类的天性扭曲成他们的想法，使他们永远改变。",
	"Travel is a perilous endeavour, especially at night (in lands fortunate enough to enjoy a sunlit day). Armoured columns of merchant caravans transport goods, nervously guarded by mercenaries who refuse to deviate from known roadways. Travellers caught in the dark are forced to lodge at the remote roadside inns for extortionate prices. Local guards are quick to leave them in the dark if they do not have the coin to pay.": "旅行是一项危险的工作，尤其是在夜间（在有幸享受阳光的土地上）。装甲商队运输货物，由拒绝偏离已知道路的雇佣兵紧张地守卫着。被困在黑暗中的旅行者被迫在偏远的路边旅店住宿，收取高额费用。如果他们没有钱支付，当地的守卫会很快把他们留在黑暗中。",
	"In their never-ending struggle to control Etharis, the deities of the world fought what they could not defeat, and ultimately turned on and destroyed each other. With but few knowing this truth, many believe that the gods abandoned a forsaken world or never existed in the first place. The only remnants of their reign are their surviving lieutenants—surviving lieutenants—the Arch Seraphs and Arch Daemons—and the forces they control.": "在他们为控制伊萨里斯而进行的无休止的斗争中，世界上的神灵们与他们无法战胜的东西进行斗争，并最终反目成仇，互相毁灭。只有少数人知道这个真相，许多人认为神灵抛弃了一个被遗弃的世界，或者一开始就不存在。他们统治的唯一遗迹是他们幸存的副手--幸存的副手--大蛇夫和大魔王，以及他们控制的力量。",
	"Arch Seraphs overlook the world with a righteous zeal, granting powers to a select few who fight in their crusades. Separated from their deities for so long, many of them have deviated from what they once represented, twisting their ideals into whatever suits their cause.": "大蛇神以一种正义的热情俯瞰世界，将权力授予少数在他们的十字军中战斗的人。与他们的神灵分离了这么久，他们中的许多人已经偏离了他们曾经代表的东西，把他们的理想扭曲成适合他们事业的东西。",
	"Arch Demons take delight in a world overrun by shadow and decay. Freed from the deities' power, they relish opportunities to feed their appetites. They take keen interests in mortal lives, often living among them, making deals and twisting fate to ensure threats to their existence are destroyed.": "大恶魔在一个被阴影和腐烂所笼罩的世界中感到高兴。从神灵的力量中解脱出来后，他们乐于抓住机会满足自己的胃口。他们对凡人的生活有着浓厚的兴趣，经常生活在他们中间，进行交易，扭曲命运，以确保对他们的存在的威胁被摧毁。",
	"Sickness and malnutrition are common and expected throughout the land of Etharis. However, there is one illness that is feared above the others. The Weeping Pox is widespread across the western coasts of the continent and frequently strikes harbours and coastal settlements. Distinguishable by the deep red lesions it creates in the skin of the infected, the disease is a death sentence for most.": "疾病和营养不良是整个Etharis土地上的常见现象，也是人们所期望的。然而，有一种疾病是最令人恐惧的。哭泣之痘广泛存在于大陆的西海岸，经常袭击港口和沿海居民区。这种疾病在感染者的皮肤上形成深红色的病变，对大多数人来说是一种死亡判决。",
	"The few who can cure the plague guard their secret closely and extract the highest prices for their intervention. The price of deliverance, for those with the choice, may be a noble estate, eternal service to the Arch Seraph of Mercy, or something far more precious.": "少数能够治愈瘟疫的人严守他们的秘密，并为他们的干预索取最高价格。拯救的代价，对于那些有选择权的人来说，可能是一份高贵的财产，对慈悲大士的永恒服务，或更珍贵的东西。",
	"Superstition and prejudice run deep. In most towns and villages across Etharis, magic is seen as both wondrous and frightening. Whether understood or not, the arcane is mistrusted and often blamed for problems ranging from the failure of a season's crops to the success of a rival's business. Many innocent people have been caught on the wrong end of superstition.": "迷信和偏见根深蒂固。在Etharis的大多数城镇和村庄，魔法被视为既神奇又可怕。无论理解与否，魔法都被不信任，并经常被指责为问题的根源，从一季作物的歉收到对手生意的成功。许多无辜的人都被迷信所害。",
	"The fear of magic runs deeper in some parts of Etharis than others. In the southern region of Castinella, this fear has manifested into an organized crusade against the arcane: the Arcanist Inquisition. The inquisitors are dedicated to destroying the arcane and anyone who stands to defend it.": "在Etharis的某些地方，对魔法的恐惧比其他地方更深。在南部的卡斯蒂内拉地区，这种恐惧表现为对奥术的有组织的讨伐：奥术师裁判所。宗教裁判所致力于摧毁奥术和任何捍卫它的人。",
	"Not all of Etharis despises spellcasters. Many cities house great colleges dedicated to the art of magic. Within these cities' walls, spellcasters can apply for a permit to practice. These permits dictate where a mage can cast spells, what type of spells they can cast, and other specifics. The process to apply for such a permit is often frighteningly bureaucratic, and many spellcasters choose to hide their abilities instead.": "并非所有的伊萨里斯都鄙视施法者。许多城市都有专门研究魔法艺术的大学院。在这些城市的城墙内，施法者可以申请执业许可。这些许可证规定了法师可以在哪里施法，他们可以施放什么类型的法术，以及其他具体细节。申请这种许可证的过程往往是令人恐惧的官僚主义，许多施法者选择隐藏他们的能力。",
	"Etharis as a campaign setting is not meant to be relentlessly bleak and depressing, or to wallow in cruelty for its own sake. Small victories become heroic when they take heroic effort to achieve. No one in Etharis is safe by default, so any safety the characters win or give to others is a true blessing. No one in Etharis is good by default, so moments of genuine grace are worth celebrating—and can come from unexpected places. Amid profound darkness, even the smallest lights have value.": "Etharis作为一个战役背景，并不意味着是无情的暗淡和压抑，也不意味着是为了残酷而沉湎于残酷。当小的胜利需要英雄般的努力来实现时，它们就会成为英雄。在Etharis没有人是安全的，所以角色们赢得或给予他人的任何安全都是一种真正的祝福。在Etharis没有人是默认的好，所以真正的优雅时刻值得庆祝，而且可能来自意想不到的地方。在极度的黑暗中，即使是最小的光也有价值。",
	"The stories you tell in Etharis belong to you and your game group. We promise not to come yell at you if you get details of the world \"wrong\" or change them to suit your own game—in fact, that's the point! We've intentionally left questions for you to answer and conflicts for you to decide.

	"In ages past, the elder races spread over Etharis and carved out separate kingdoms for themselves. Then the humans came, and all but annihilated the other races in their relentless drive to multiply and expand.": "在过去的岁月里，年长的种族遍布伊萨里斯，并为自己开辟了独立的王国。然后，人类来了，在他们无情的繁殖和扩张的驱动下，几乎消灭了其他种族。",
	"Today, humans are still the most numerous and powerful race in Etharis. The elder races survive either in isolated remnants of their own domains, or incorporated into larger human kingdoms. But it is an age of crisis, and some see the opportunity to claw back what their ancestors lost.": "今天，人类仍然是Etharis中最多和最强大的种族。年长的种族要么在他们自己领域的孤立的残余中生存，要么被纳入更大的人类王国。但这是一个危机四伏的时代，一些人看到了夺回他们祖先失去的东西的机会。",
	"Though they are reduced in number, members of the elder races are a common sight anywhere in Etharis. Perhaps because they so often live on the fringes of human civilization, they also make up a disproportionate number of its adventurers.": "虽然他们的数量减少了，但在伊萨里斯的任何地方，长者种族的成员都是常见的景象。也许是因为他们经常生活在人类文明的边缘，所以他们在人类文明的冒险者中也占了一个不成比例的数量。",
	"While the elves and the dwarves were the first races to claim lands in the world of Etharis, the versatile race of the humans were the ones to survive and dominate. Humans nowadays can be found from the frozen and inhospitable tundra of the North to the scorched plains of the South. Emerging from the temperate forests of central Etharis, now known as the Bürach, humans were not considered a threat by other races. Left unchecked, their numbers quickly grew. It was their adaptable nature and adventurous mindset that quickly led them to expand beyond their homelands. By the time the great kingdoms of the elves and the mighty thanedoms of the dwarves realized the violence that inevitably follows the humans, it was already too late. The eyes of the human leaders fell greedily on the prosperous lands of the elves and dwarves. The great Era of Expansion, also known as the Great Purge, had begun and humans were here to stay. Different tribal armies marched simultaneously north, south and west; no land was safe. Unable to unite or react in time, the dwarven and elven monarchs watched as human warriors swarmed and usurped their lands. The human race emerged victorious after countless generations of bloodshed that changed Etharis forever.": "虽然精灵和矮人是最早在伊萨利斯世界中占有土地的种族，但多才多艺的人类却是生存和统治的种族。如今，从北方冰冷而荒凉的苔原到南方炙热的平原，都能找到人类。人类从伊萨里斯中部的温带森林中出现，现在被称为布拉赫，其他种族并不认为他们是一种威胁。如果不加控制，他们的数量迅速增长。正是他们的适应性和冒险心态，使他们很快就扩展到了家乡以外的地方。当伟大的精灵王国和强大的矮人王国意识到人类不可避免的暴力时，已经太晚了。人类领袖的目光贪婪地落在了精灵和矮人的繁荣土地上。伟大的扩张时代，也被称为大清洗，已经开始，人类在这里留下了。不同部落的军队同时向北、向南、向西进军；没有一块土地是安全的。矮人和精灵的君主们无法及时团结起来或做出反应，眼睁睁地看着人类战士蜂拥而至，侵占他们的土地。人类在经历了无数代的流血事件后取得了胜利，永远地改变了伊萨里斯。",
	"In victory, they showed little mercy to the elder races. They entirely dismantled the elven kingdoms, pushing them deeper in the forests. They drove dwarves from their homelands, forcing them to hide deep beneath the mountains. The humans would have stopped at nothing, if conflict from within had not forced their armies to a halt. Having exterminated all the other kingdoms, the warlords turned against each other, each claiming the High Throne that would later become the Imperial Throne of Altenheim. This second Great Era, known as the Era of Descent, lost even more lives to its endless carnage. The result was the disintegration of the human race into fractious kingdoms. The Second Era considerably weakened the kingdoms of the humans, allowing the other races to emerge from hiding and re-establish some principalities in the lands they once ruled.": "在胜利中，他们对年长的种族几乎没有怜悯。他们完全瓦解了精灵王国，把他们推到森林深处。他们把矮人赶出他们的家园，迫使他们躲在山下深处。如果不是来自内部的冲突迫使他们的军队停滞不前，人类会不惜一切代价。在消灭了所有其他的王国之后，军阀们相互对立，各自要求获得后来成为阿尔坦海姆帝国王座的高位。这第二个伟大的时代，被称为 \"后裔时代\"，在无尽的大屠杀中失去了更多的生命。其结果是人类解体为分裂的王国。第二纪元大大削弱了人类的王国，使其他种族得以从隐蔽处出现，并在他们曾经统治的土地上重新建立起一些公国。",
	"To this day, humans are considered the dominant race across all of Etharis, controlling most of the land and sea. Having shorter lives to live than the other races, their old hatreds have faded, and they are now more receptive to other races. But elves and dwarves live long, and can hold a grudge even longer.": "时至今日，人类被认为是整个Etharis的主导种族，控制着大部分的陆地和海洋。由于比其他种族活得更短，他们以前的仇恨已经消退，现在他们更容易接受其他种族。但是，精灵和矮人的寿命很长，而且可以记恨得更久。",
	"The proud and elegant elves were among the first people to dwell among the forests of Etharis. Their long history is lost in distant eons, and even elves with their long lifespans do not fully know their true origins. Tall, graceful, and extraordinarily beautiful, they claimed the forests and river lands of Caer Neiada, in what is now the Charneault Kingdom, creating magnificent kingdoms deep within the woods.": "骄傲而优雅的精灵是最早居住在伊萨利斯森林中的人之一。他们漫长的历史已经消失在遥远的年代，即使是拥有漫长寿命的精灵也不完全了解他们的真正起源。他们高大、优雅、格外美丽，他们在现在的查尔纳奥特王国的森林和河流地带称雄，在森林深处创造了宏伟的王国。",
	"Blessed with keen eyesight and a great talent for archery, they have created a long-lasting tradition of rangers to protect their kingdoms from outside threats. Their deep knowledge of the woodlands further complimented their deadly and silent armies, making them a force to be reckoned with in these early days. Living for eons, however, the elves gradually became arrogant, often isolating themselves from the other races—especially humans, who they considered primitive and barbaric, failing to recognize them as a plausible threat.": "受益于敏锐的视力和巨大的射箭天赋，他们创造了一个持久的游侠传统，以保护他们的王国免受外部威胁。他们对林地的深刻了解进一步补充了他们致命而沉默的军队，使他们在这些早期的日子里成为一支不可忽视的力量。然而，生活了漫长的岁月，精灵们逐渐变得傲慢起来，经常将自己与其他种族隔离开来--尤其是人类，他们认为人类是原始和野蛮的，没有认识到他们是一个可信的威胁。",
	"The Era of Expansion cost the elves dearly. Their kingdoms were turned to dust, and many of their forests were turned to ash. Even though their bows were precise, they were outnumbered and unable to defend themselves on all fronts as war-hungry armies burned their sheltering forests. The elves lived for decades as nomads, trying to hide in the few remaining forests on the outskirts of the human civilization. However, their sorrow and grief for the lost beauty of their home empowered them to recreate it. They turned to the arts. Heartbreaking songs of their lost paradises would echo among the trees in the night. Most importantly, though, they turned to magic. The forest spirits that had once guided them were not vanquished, and were eager to aid old friends. They bestowed the elves with their magic—the power to restore their lands to their ancient beauty.": "扩张时代让精灵们付出了沉重的代价。他们的王国变成了灰尘，许多森林变成了灰烬。尽管他们的弓箭很精确，但由于渴望战争的军队烧毁了他们的庇护森林，他们寡不敌众，无法在各条战线上保卫自己。精灵们作为游牧民族生活了几十年，试图躲在人类文明郊区仅存的几片森林里。然而，他们对失去家园之美的悲痛和哀伤使他们有能力重新创造它。他们转向了艺术。关于他们失去的天堂的令人心碎的歌曲将在夜晚的树丛中回荡。然而，最重要的是，他们转向了魔法。曾经引导过他们的森林精灵并没有被征服，他们渴望帮助老朋友。他们赋予了精灵们魔法--将他们的土地恢复到古代的美丽的力量。",
	"Ancient and dauntless as the mountains they call home, the dwarven race stepped onto the land of Etharis alongside the elves. Unlike the elves, however, the dwarves built their kingdoms deep within the mountains of what is now the Bürach Empire. Adept with metalworking and jewel crafting, the dwarves created countless cities in the hills and two impressive, impenetrable capitals in the oldest mountains of the continent, the Rock Teeth and the Grey Spine. The veins of mithril and gold were rich beneath these mountains and dwarven crafters quickly became famous across Etharis.": "矮人族和他们的家园一样古老而无畏，他们与精灵一起踏上了伊萨利斯的土地。然而，与精灵不同的是，矮人在现在的比拉赫帝国的山脉深处建立了他们的王国。擅长金属加工和珠宝制作的矮人在山丘上建造了无数的城市，并在大陆最古老的山脉--岩牙山和灰刺山中建造了两座令人印象深刻、难以攻破的首都。这些山脉下有丰富的米特尔和黄金矿脉，矮人手工业者很快就在整个伊萨利斯闻名。",
	"During the wars of the Era of Expansion, the dwarves barricaded themselves within the fortresses of their two greatest cities: the tiered city of Stehlenwald and the now ruined city of Grebenstein. The dwarves of Grebenstein were besieged by the human warlords who would later lay the groundwork of the Bürach Empire.": "在扩张时代的战争中，矮人把自己困在他们两个最伟大的城市的堡垒里：层层叠叠的斯泰伦瓦尔德城和现已被毁的格莱本斯坦城。格雷本施泰因的矮人被人类军阀围困，这些军阀后来奠定了布拉克帝国的基础。",
	"Though the dwarves fought valiantly for their homelands, the Bürach warlords uprooted their thanedom and claimed their vein rich mines.": "尽管矮人为他们的家园进行了英勇的战斗，但毕拉赫军阀将他们的家园连根拔起，并夺走了他们富饶的矿场。",
	"The second dwarven kingdom of Stehlenwald, however, endured the siege. Rather than share the fate of their cousins to the north, the Stehlenwald Dwarves dug deeper into the heart of the mountain. There, their miners laid eyes upon a new metal which was impenetrable to the arrows of their enemies; adamantine. With armour and weapons of impeccable craftsmanship, the dwarven battalions managed to push the invaders back to their homelands, but at a great cost: half of their population was exterminated, either by the war or by famine. Isolation within the mountains was their only option for survival.": "然而，第二个矮人王国斯泰伦瓦尔德却经受住了围攻。Stehlenwald矮人并没有分享他们北方表亲的命运，而是在山的中心地带挖得更深。在那里，他们的矿工看到了一种新的金属，这种金属无法穿透敌人的箭矢；金刚砂。凭借无可挑剔的盔甲和武器，矮人营成功地将入侵者赶回了他们的家园，但也付出了巨大的代价：一半的人口被灭绝了，不是被战争就是被饥荒。隔离在山区是他们生存的唯一选择。",
	"By the birth of the various human kingdoms, the proud dwarves of Stehlewald had begun to recover their numbers. When they emerged, they realized that the political landscape had dramatically changed. They were surrounded and vastly outnumbered by the armies of the Bürach Empire. The dwarven emperor realized there was only one way for his race to survive and prosper, and struck a deal with the Bürach Empire. They would surrender their lands and become members of the Bürach, as long as they could govern themselves independently.": "到了各个人类王国的诞生，骄傲的斯泰尔瓦尔德矮人已经开始恢复他们的数量。当他们出现时，他们意识到政治格局发生了巨大的变化。他们被比拉赫帝国的军队所包围，而且人数众多。矮人皇帝意识到他的种族只有一个办法可以生存和繁荣，于是与比拉赫帝国达成了协议。他们将交出自己的土地，成为布拉克的成员，只要他们能够独立管理自己。",
	"Some older dwarves still cannot forget that the human race once tried to eradicate them. As they say, it is easier to move a mountain than a dwarf. But though there is still a deep rivalry between humans and dwarves, the Stehlenwald province of Rauland will be there for the Bürach Empire in times of need—an oath none expect to be broken.": "一些年长的矮人仍然无法忘记，人类曾经试图消灭他们。正如他们所说，搬动一座山比搬动一个矮人更容易。但是，尽管人类和矮人之间仍然存在着深刻的对抗，但在需要的时候，罗兰德的斯泰伦瓦尔德省会为布拉克帝国提供帮助--没有人期望这个誓言会被打破。",
	"Orcs in the world of Etharis exist only as villains in fairy tales told to scare naughty children. They were described as violent brutes who lived only to inflict mayhem on everyone. Nevertheless, orcs roamed Etharis even before the dwarves and the elves, and their description in the fairy tales preserves a sinister truth. No one knows why the orcs disappeared from Etharis en masse, except that the last of them were seen in Valika, before they were presumably slain or bred out. However, all know the ominous reminder of their dark and violent past.": "兽人在伊萨利斯的世界中只作为童话故事中的恶棍存在，用来吓唬淘气的孩子。他们被描述为暴力的畜生，只为给大家带来混乱。然而，兽人甚至在矮人和精灵之前就在伊萨里斯游荡，他们在童话故事中的描述保留了一个险恶的事实。没有人知道为什么兽人会从伊萨里斯大规模消失，只是最后一次见到他们是在瓦里卡，在他们被杀或被繁殖之前。然而，所有人都知道他们黑暗和暴力的过去的不祥的提醒。",
	"The half-orcs of Etharis are tall, daunting, and fierce warriors. Some say that these humanoids are the result of breeding between early human tribes and the last orcs. Others say they are the creation of a lost war god who wanted to immortalize his own image. In any case, the half-orcs combine the best out of their two parts: the formidable resilience of an orc, and the adaptability of a human.": "伊萨里斯的半兽人是高大、令人生畏、凶猛的战士。有人说，这些人形生物是早期人类部落和最后的兽人之间繁殖的结果。还有人说，他们是一个失落的战神的创造，他想让自己的形象永垂不朽。在任何情况下，半兽人结合了他们两个部分的优点：兽人强大的韧性和人类的适应能力。",
	"The only part of Etharis where half-orcs gather under any form of organization is in the frozen north among the Valikan Clans. There, nomadic tribes of humans, half-orcs, and giants roam the northern wastelands. The unforgiving climate seems to suit half-orcs and encourage humans to accept them for their hardiness. The other field where a half-orc can thrive is war. Half-orcs are often found among the raiding parties of the Valikan clans.": "Etharis唯一一个半兽人以任何组织形式聚集的地方是在冰冻的北方Valikan氏族中。在那里，由人类、半兽人和巨人组成的游牧部落在北部荒原上游荡。这种无情的气候似乎很适合半兽人，并鼓励人类接受他们的坚韧。半兽人可以茁壮成长的另一个领域是战争。半兽人经常出现在瓦里肯（Valikan）氏族的突击队中。",
	"Outside of Valika, half-orcs are a rare sight, but they can be found across the various cities of the continent. The stereotypes involving their ancestors, combined with their intimidating appearance, strike fear among the other races, so that half-orcs are rarely accepted or trusted despite their capabilities. Warriors of other races often prefer to mock what they fear, all the while hoping they will never have to face an angry half-orc on equal terms.": "在瓦里卡之外，半兽人是一个罕见的景象，但他们可以在大陆的各个城市找到。涉及他们祖先的刻板印象，加上他们令人生畏的外表，在其他种族中引起了恐惧，因此，尽管半兽人有能力，却很少被接受或信任。其他种族的战士往往喜欢嘲笑他们所害怕的东西，同时希望他们永远不必在平等的条件下面对一个愤怒的半兽人。",
	"Half-elves are among the later races to walk the land of Etharis. Before the Era of Expansion, humans and elves occasionally crossed paths. Some humans could appreciate the beautiful songs and poems of the elves, as the elves could appreciate the adventurous side of humanity. The results of these bonds were the ever-wandering half-elves. They are easily noticed by their less pronounced pointed elfin ears, combined with a bulkier but still elegant human frame. As with half-orcs, half-elves seem to have taken the best of their progenitors. Taller than the average man, elegant and graceful, they seem to possess the aptitude for the fine arts from their elven side along with the lust for adventure from their human side. What life could be better for them than the lives of wanderers, traveling artists, and merchants?": "半精灵是后来行走在伊萨利斯土地上的种族之一。在扩张时代之前，人类和精灵偶尔会有交集。一些人类可以欣赏精灵的美丽歌曲和诗歌，就像精灵可以欣赏人类冒险的一面一样。这些联系的结果就是不断流浪的半精灵。他们很容易被注意到，他们不太明显的尖尖的精灵耳朵，再加上一个比较笨重但仍然优雅的人类框架。与半兽人一样，半精灵似乎吸取了他们祖先的精华。他们比一般人要高，优雅而有风度，他们似乎拥有来自精灵方面的美术天赋，以及来自人类方面的冒险欲望。对他们来说，还有什么生活能比流浪者、旅行艺术家和商人的生活更好呢？",
	"However, even though most of the first half-elves were results of love between the two races, such pairings were still considered taboo by the two sides. In the midst of war, most elves could not understand how someone could fall in love with a savage, while few humans could forgive anyone who would mingle with the enemy. The first half-elves were cast out by both sides.": "然而，尽管第一批半精灵大多是两个种族之间爱情的结果，这种配对仍然被双方视为禁忌。在战争中，大多数精灵无法理解怎么会有人爱上一个野蛮人，而很少有人类能够原谅任何与敌人打成一片的人。第一批半精灵被双方赶走了。",
	"Initially, the lifestyle of the wanderer suited them. Their talent in theater and music made wandering troupes of half-elves among the most famous to exist. Furthermore, half-elves could act as natural intermediaries between humans and elves. However, most half-elves keep the burdens of their souls well hidden. They learnt how to wear the mask of happiness, often dressing with bright colours and dazzling jewelry, accompanying their stylistic choices with an outwardly flamboyant, optimistic attitude. But if one is lucky enough to gain the trust of a half-elf, they will often see that the heart of a half-elf is full of sorrow. Wandering the continent is a lifestyle that fits them, but they can never call any place home. Considered outcasts by both humans and elves, they think themselves cursed, eternally strangers, with no hope of claiming any land as their own.": "最初，流浪者的生活方式适合他们。他们在戏剧和音乐方面的天赋使半精灵的流浪剧团成为最有名的存在。此外，半精灵可以作为人类和精灵之间的天然中间人。然而，大多数半精灵把他们灵魂的负担隐藏得很好。他们学会了如何戴上幸福的面具，经常穿戴鲜艳的颜色和耀眼的珠宝，用一种外在的浮夸、乐观的态度来配合他们的风格选择。但如果有人有幸获得半精灵的信任，他们往往会看到半精灵的内心充满了悲伤。在大陆上流浪是一种适合他们的生活方式，但他们永远不能把任何地方称为家。他们被人类和精灵视为弃儿，认为自己被诅咒了，永远是个陌生人，没有希望将任何土地作为自己的土地。",
	"Children of the dragons, as their name states, dragonborn walk with pride through a world that greets them either with fear or admiration. They look very much like dragons, with thick scales covering their bodies, sharp claws, and fangs which they can use as weapons. Though they lack wings, they are strongly built and stout with colours resembling those of their ancestors.": "龙族的孩子，正如他们的名字一样，龙族带着骄傲走过这个世界，迎接他们的是恐惧或钦佩。他们看起来非常像龙，身上覆盖着厚厚的鳞片，有锋利的爪子，还有可以作为武器使用的獠牙。虽然他们没有翅膀，但他们身材强壮，体型粗壮，颜色与他们的祖先相似。",
	"Some claim that this race must be the most ancient among all races. In the Era of Expansion, they were settled in a small kingdom caught amidst the bloody conflicts between humans and elves. This conflict led to the destruction of the only place they truly belonged to, the city of Ember Cairn. However, this noble race managed to survive. Eons passed as the dragonborn prayed to the dragon gods to restore their kingdom, and the dragon gods did not answer. Wrath grew among the Dragonborn, as well as desperation. They stopped praying to their dragon lords and their religion, the Sacred Flame, was abandoned.": "有些人声称，这个种族一定是所有种族中最古老的。在扩张时代，他们被安置在一个小王国里，夹在人类和精灵的血腥冲突中。这场冲突导致了他们唯一真正属于的地方--微光之城的毁灭。然而，这个高贵的种族设法生存下来。当龙族向龙神祈祷恢复他们的王国时，岁月流逝，而龙神没有回应。愤怒在龙族中增长，同时也是绝望的。他们不再向他们的龙主祈祷，他们的宗教--神圣的火焰--也被放弃了。",
	"The dragonborn, however, pious and spiritual by nature, needed something to believe in. A new religion was offered to them by Castinellan missionaries who were spreading the word of their new religion, that of the Divine Seraphs. Finding it close to the dragonborn ideals of virtue and determination, they quickly embraced the new religion and became its most zealous followers. Sharing the same beliefs with the humans of the Castinella Provinces, they were quickly incorporated to the empire, becoming subjects of the Castinellan theocracy.": "然而，龙族的天性是虔诚和精神的，他们需要一些东西来信仰。卡斯蒂利亚的传教士向他们提供了一种新的宗教，他们正在传播他们的新宗教--神圣的Seraphs。他们发现这种宗教与龙族的美德和决心的理想很接近，所以很快就接受了这种新宗教，并成为其最狂热的追随者。与卡斯蒂内拉省的人类有着相同的信仰，他们很快被纳入帝国，成为卡斯蒂内拉神权的臣民。",
	"Castinella awarded the dragonborn a small region of their ancestral land to call their own. Dragonborn rebuilt the ancient city of Ember Cairn, a city made entirely of granite. Many dragonborn from across the continent flocked to the city and began to worship the Divine Seraphs. This city became a site of religious pilgrimage for dragonborn across the continent. With their ancient prayers finally answered, the dragonborn were drawn to the paths of clerics, missionaries, and inquisitors, to spread their new beliefs with burning passion and burning fire when necessary. The land of Etharis will hear the dragons roar once again.": "卡斯蒂内拉授予龙裔一小块属于他们祖先的土地，让他们称之为自己的土地。龙裔重建了微光之城（Ember Cairn）这座完全由花岗岩制成的古城。许多来自大陆各地的龙裔涌向这座城市，并开始崇拜神圣的Seraphs。这座城市成为整个大陆的龙裔的宗教朝圣地。随着他们古老的祈祷终于得到回应，龙裔被吸引到神职人员、传教士和审问者的道路上，以燃烧的激情和必要时燃烧的火焰来传播他们的新信仰。伊萨里斯的土地将再次听到龙的咆哮。",
	"Ingenious and full of energy, gnomes are considered to be distant cousins of the dwarven race. Even shorter than the dwarves and not equally bulky, this small-framed race compensates for the lack of muscle with everworking brains and a great aptitude for invention. Even though their inventions have a bad habit of blowing up, no one can stay mad at a gnome. Their cheerful attitude, curiosity, and humor puts the gnomes among the most likely to have a good feast or a carefree dance.": "巧妙而充满能量，地精被认为是矮人种族的远房表亲。他们比矮人更矮，也不同样笨重，这个小身材的种族用不断工作的大脑和巨大的发明才能来弥补肌肉的不足。尽管他们的发明有炸毁的坏习惯，但没有人能够对地精保持生气。他们开朗的态度、好奇心和幽默感使地精成为最有可能拥有一场美好的盛宴或无忧无虑的舞蹈的人。",
	"Apart from their joyful side, they have created some of the most impressive mechanical wonders of Etharis. Cannons, automatons, flintlocks, and explosives are all reputed to be results of gnomish brilliance. If you are looking for a gnome in a populated city, you just have to wait for the explosion to guide your steps.": "除了他们快乐的一面，他们还创造了一些伊萨里斯最令人印象深刻的机械奇迹。大炮、自动机、燧发枪和炸药都被认为是地精的辉煌成果。如果你在人口密集的城市寻找地精，你只需等待爆炸来引导你的脚步。",
	"During the Era of Expansion, gnome settlements outside the shelter of mountains were annihilated by human warlords, forcing them to seek shelter in the neighboring dwarven city of Stehlenwald. There they shared the fate of their dwarven cousins as countless human armies besieged the tall stone walls of the city.": "在扩张时代，地精在山脉庇护之外的定居点被人类军阀消灭，迫使他们在邻近的矮人城市Stehlenwald寻求庇护。在那里，他们和他们的矮人表亲一样，被无数的人类军队围困在城市的高大石墙下。",
	"The surviving gnomes pushed the dwarven thane to dig deeper, in a last attempt to find new metals or an escape route beneath the mountains.": "幸存的地精们推动矮人酋长向更深处挖掘，最后试图在山下找到新的金属或一条逃跑路线。",
	"As the dwarves were gazing upon the newfound adamantine, the gnomes were staring at the other veins of the mountain, their ingenious minds hatching a plan to win the war.": "当矮人凝视着新发现的金刚砂时，地精们正盯着山的另一条脉络，他们聪明的头脑正在策划一个赢得战争的计划。",
	"The gnomish alchemists worked day and night, mixing the gifts of the mountain until they invented a new weapon: explosives. As the dwarves charged in their impenetrable shining adamantine armours, they were backed up by the sound of explosions as the gnomes hurled cannonballs and dynamite at the enemy. The humans quickly scattered; the effects of the explosives had struck fear into their hearts. The battle was won but the losses for both gnomes and dwarves were great. The gnomish race followed the dwarves in the Stehlenwald kingdom into their centuries-long isolation. When the dwarven king voluntarily joined the Bürach empire, the gnomes followed. Today, with trade reaching all across the empire, the gnomes can lay hands on even more exotic and volatile materials, pushing (or blowing) their science to new heights each passing day.": "地精炼金术师们日夜工作，混合山中的礼物，直到他们发明了一种新武器：炸药。当矮人穿着坚不可摧的闪亮金刚盔甲冲锋时，他们得到了地精向敌人投掷炮弹和炸药的爆炸声的支持。人类很快就散开了；炸药的效果让他们心生恐惧。战斗胜利了，但地精和矮人的损失都很大。侏儒种族跟随斯泰伦瓦尔德王国的矮人进入了长达数百年的隔离状态。当矮人国王自愿加入比拉赫帝国时，地精们也跟着加入。今天，随着贸易遍及整个帝国，地精们可以掌握更多的奇异和不稳定的材料，每天都将他们的科学推到（或吹到）新高度。",
	"At one time humankind, being an unstoppable force in Etharis, earned the enmity of most races. All who tried to oppose them were met with destruction. One race, however, chose not to contest the humans' ascendency, but instead decided to cling to their backs for survival.": "曾几何时，人类作为Etharis的一支不可阻挡的力量，赢得了大多数种族的敌视。所有试图反对他们的人都遭到了毁灭。然而，有一个种族选择不与人类争夺统治权，而是决定依附于他们的背上生存。",
	"The Era of Expansion did not affect the population of halflings like it did other races. Even though the halflings did not agree with the violent ways of the humans, they fell silent, deciding that being subservient to the stronger and better-armed human armies would guarantee their survival. After the division of the humans into different empires and kingdoms, halflings fit in perfectly, many acquiring positions as librarians, bookkeepers, teachers, or scholars.": "扩张时代并没有像其他种族那样影响半身人的人口。尽管半身人不同意人类的暴力方式，但他们还是保持了沉默，决定服从于更强大、武器更精良的人类军队，以保证他们的生存。在人类分裂成不同的帝国和王国后，半身人完美地融入其中，许多人获得了图书馆管理员、图书管理员、教师或学者的职位。",
	"Shorter and weaker in stature than dwarves, halflings are a peaceful race. What most of these tiny folk seek in life is a place to settle in peace and quiet, far away from the atrocities of war. They enjoy good music, fine food, and a good laugh when they can.": "半身人的身材比矮人更矮小，是一个和平的种族。这些渺小的民族在生活中寻求的是一个和平和安静的地方，远离战争的暴行。他们喜欢好的音乐、精美的食物，并在可能的情况下尽情欢笑。",
	"This does not mean that this race shuns adventuring. Tales of halfling rogues or scholars, seeking ancient and hidden knowledge, are some of the most famous there are.": "这并不意味着这个种族回避冒险。关于半身人流氓或学者的故事，寻求古老而隐秘的知识，是一些最著名的故事。",
	"Unlike gnomes, however, they care little for jewels or inventions. Halflings use the lore they gather to build impressive libraries on specific subjects. Within the countless volumes of these libraries lie generations of knowledge pertaining to the halflings passions, from cooking to brewing, bee keeping, and much more.": "然而，与地精不同，他们对珠宝或发明不感兴趣。半身人利用他们收集的传说建立了令人印象深刻的特定主题的图书馆。在这些图书馆的无数卷书中，隐藏着与半身人的爱好有关的几代人的知识，从烹饪到酿酒，养蜂，以及更多。",
	"Monsters and nightmarish creatures lurk throughout the dark world of Etharis. To combat them, civilization seeks any advantage it can find. From the mighty inventions of the dwarves to the ingenious and mad creations of the gnomes, an array of advanced weapons have been devised. The Advanced Weapons table below details weapon characteristics, including their unique properties.": "怪物和噩梦般的生物潜伏在Etharis的黑暗世界中。为了对付它们，人类文明寻求它能找到的任何优势。从矮人强大的发明到地精巧妙而疯狂的创造，一系列先进的武器已经被设计出来。下面的高级武器表详细说明了武器的特性，包括它们的独特属性。",
	"Advanced weapons are difficult to master, and as a result require more specialised training than even martial weapons. Characters gain proficiency in Advanced Weapons when they reach 3rd level and have proficiency in all Martial Weapons.

When fired, Blackpowder weapons emit a deafening crack audible 300 feet away. Unfortunately, Blackpowder weapons often become useless when wet.

A character cannot use this weapon again until they complete a short rest in dry conditions.": "{@i {@b Blackpowder.}}黑火药武器发射的弹丸发出刺耳的噪音，以致命的力量撕碎盔甲。发射时，黑火药武器会发出震耳欲聋的破裂声，300英尺外都能听到。不幸的是，黑火药武器在潮湿时往往变得毫无用处。如果黑火药武器被暴露在大雨中，被淹没，或被类似的方法浸泡在水中，那么它就不能发射。在干燥条件下完成短暂的休息之前，角色不能再次使用这种武器。",

When making an attack with a Cumbersome weapon, you must use your Strength modifier for both the attack and damage rolls.": "{@i {@b Cumbersome.}} 笨重的武器难以挥舞，但对于那些足够强大的人来说是有效的工具。当使用笨重的武器进行攻击时，你必须使用你的力量修正值来进行攻击和伤害卷。",
	"{@i {@b Guard.}} Guard weapons are made to fight defensively, often designed with a long reach or flat surface for parrying. While wielding a Guard weapon, whenever a hostile creature moves within your reach, and you did not move on your last turn, you can use a reaction to make a weapon attack with a Guard weapon against that creature. If the attack hits, then it deals no damage, the creature immediately stops and its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn.": "{@i {@b Guard.}}护卫武器是用来防守的，通常设计成长距离或平坦的表面，以利于抵挡。在挥舞护卫武器时，每当一个敌对的生物在你的范围内移动，而你在上一回合没有移动，你可以使用一个反应，用护卫武器对该生物进行一次武器攻击。如果攻击命中，则不造成任何伤害，该生物立即停止，其速度变为0，直到其回合结束。",
	"{@i {@b Momentum.}} Momentum weapons are designed to deliver devastating attacks as part of a charge. When you hit a creature with a Momentum weapon, and you have moved 20 feet or more in a straight line this turn, you can upgrade the damage dice to the weapon's momentum dice value.": "{@i {@b Momentum.}}动量武器是用来作为冲锋的一部分提供毁灭性的攻击。当你用动量武器击中一个生物，并且你在本回合内直线移动了20英尺或以上，你可以将伤害骰子升级为武器的动量骰子值。",
	"{@i {@b Repeater.}} Repeater weapons fire rounds in quick succession, either using multiple barrels or quick reloading mechanisms.": "{@i {@b Repeater.}}中继器使用多个枪管或快速装弹机制，快速连续发射子弹。",
	"When you take the attack action with a Repeater weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack again with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the second shot, unless that modifier is negative. You can make this bonus action even if the weapon has the Loading property.": "当你使用中继器进行攻击动作时，你可以使用一个额外的动作，用同一把武器再次攻击。你不需要在第二次射击的伤害中加入你的能力修改器，除非该修改器是负的。即使该武器具有加载属性，你也可以进行这个奖励动作。",

When you miss an attack with a Swift weapon, you gain advantage on the next attack roll you make with that weapon against the same target.": "{@i {@b Swift.}}迅捷武器因其在恢复攻击失误方面的效用而闻名。当你用迅捷武器攻击失败时，你在下一次用该武器对同一目标进行攻击时获得优势。",
	"{@i {@b Scatter.}} Scatter weapons are capable of devastating multiple enemies at once. When you take the attack action and successfully hit a creature with a Scatter weapon, measure the weapon's Scatter range from the square (or point of impact) that the target you hit occupies. All creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon's scatter range must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Scatter DC. Upon a failed save, they take damage equal to the ability score modifier you used to hit with the weapon (minimum of 1). Damage dealt this way is the same type as the weapon that you hit with.": "{@i {@b Scatter.}} 散射武器能够同时摧毁多个敌人。当你采取攻击行动并成功用散射武器击中一个生物时，从你击中的目标所处的方格（或撞击点）开始测量武器的散射范围。所有在武器散射范围内的除原始目标外的生物都必须对你的散射DC做一个灵巧的救赎。蓄力失败后，他们受到的伤害等于你用武器打出的能力分数修正值（最小为1）。这种方式造成的伤害与你击中的武器类型相同。",

	"All curses have a culmination. This is the final intent of the curse, and often involves transforming the victim into a twisted creature, barely resembling who they once were. Culminations are truly evil effects and are almost always permanent. When a creature fails an escalation check at stage 3 of a curse, they apply the effects of the curse's culmination. They continue to apply the effects of the previous stages, but cease making escalation checks. Once a curse's culmination has been reached, it can only be cured with the use of a wish spell.": "所有的诅咒都有一个高潮。这是诅咒的最终意图，通常涉及到将受害者变成一个扭曲的生物，几乎不像是他们曾经是谁。终结是真正的邪恶效果，几乎总是永久性的。当一个生物在诅咒的第三阶段没有通过升级检查时，他们就会应用诅咒的高潮效果。他们继续应用前几个阶段的效果，但停止进行升级检查。一旦诅咒的顶点达到，它只能通过使用愿望法术来治愈。",

	"Once you have selected your profession, you gain access to its Profession Ability. This is an activity that you have practiced time and time again, becoming an expert in this field.

Once you have attempted a profession ability, you cannot attempt it again until you complete a long rest.": "一旦你选择了你的职业，你就能获得其职业能力。这是你一次又一次练习的活动，成为这个领域的专家。每个职业能力都需要花费一小时来完成任务，并需要进行中等DC技能检查。一旦你尝试了一项职业能力，你就不能再尝试了，直到你完成一次长时休息。",
	"Profession Dice are the in-game advantages provided to characters by their background profession. Characters can add their Profession Die to skill or ability checks according to any Talents they have selected.": "职业骰子是游戏中角色的背景职业所提供的优势。角色可以根据他们选择的任何天赋，在技能或能力检查中加入他们的职业骰子。",
	"In addition, a character always adds their Profession Die when rolling for Profession Abilities.": "此外，在滚动职业能力时，一个角色总是加上他们的职业模子。",
	"A character's Profession Die is determined by their rank, and shown in the table below:": "一个角色的职业模子是由他们的等级决定的，并在下表中显示。",
	"When a player is required to make a skill check, the DC is determined by the GM using the following table:": "当玩家被要求进行技能检查时，DC由GM使用下表决定。",
	"Medium": "中型",
	"Very Hard": "非常困难",
	"Impossible": "不可能的",
	"When determining DC, a GM may start with the complexity of the task, then adjust it based on environmental factors. For example, a character may be trying to climb a ladder, a task which would normally not require a skill check. However, the weather is chilly, and the ladder is slick with ice, so the GM decides to set a Medium DC. This DC might be increased again for further complicating factors, such as pursuing enemies or if the ladder is broken.": "在确定DC时，GM可以从任务的复杂性开始，然后根据环境因素进行调整。例如，一个角色可能正试图爬上一个梯子，这个任务通常不需要技能检查。然而，天气很冷，梯子上有冰，所以GM决定设置一个中等的DC。这个DC可能会因为更多的复杂因素而再次增加，比如追击的敌人或者梯子坏了。",
	"Note: It is important to remember that rolling a natural 20 on a skill check does not result in an automatic success.": "注意：重要的是要记住，在技能检查中掷出自然的20分并不导致自动成功。",
	"When creating a character, Advanced Backgrounds add skill proficiencies and starting equipment in a similar way to backgrounds.": "在创建角色时，高级背景以类似于背景的方式增加技能熟练度和起始装备。",

Once you've made your choices, apply your starting equipment and proficiency from your background and profession.": "一旦你选择了你的背景和职业，你就可以根据你的背景的选择列表选择一个技能熟练度。一旦你做了选择，就应用你的起始装备和你的背景和职业的熟练度。",
	"Rankings represent a character's standing within the world of their profession. Each profession has four ranks, with characters starting at the first rank. Whenever a character meets the progression milestones of a rank within their profession (as discussed with the GM), they may progress to the next rank of that profession.": "等级代表一个角色在其职业世界中的地位。每个职业都有四个等级，角色从第一个等级开始。每当一个角色在其职业中达到一个等级的进展里程碑（与GM讨论过），他们就可以进展到该职业的下一个等级。",
	"A Captain and his daring crew or a Duke and his extravagant estate are both examples of a profession's holdings. Within Advanced Backgrounds, holdings are the assets, resources, or advantages a character gains through their position. Holdings vary between professions, from finding free lodging to acquiring a grand fortress and legions of soldiers, or anything in between. Within each profession are examples of the sorts of holdings a character might achieve as they progress through the professional ranks. Whenever a character advances in rank, they retain their holdings from previous ranks.": "一个船长和他勇敢的船员，或者一个公爵和他奢侈的庄园，都是一个职业的财产的例子。在 \"高级背景 \"中，财产是一个角色通过其地位获得的资产、资源或优势。不同的职业有不同的财产，从找到免费的住宿到获得巨大的堡垒和士兵军团，或者介于两者之间的任何东西。在每个职业中，都有一个例子说明角色在职业等级中可能获得的财产。每当一个角色的等级提高时，他们会保留以前等级的财产。",
	"Progressions are examples of what may be required for you to advance in rank within your profession. From making a medical breakthrough to being appointed by a monarch, progressions vary depending on the rank and profession they belong to. Progressions make great character goals and can be tied into existing character or party goals. For example, a scribe looking to disprove falsehoods could do so by pursuing the mystery at the heart of the campaign's overall story.": "进阶是你在你的职业中提升等级可能需要的例子。从取得医学上的突破到被君主任命，不同的等级和职业会有不同的进展。进步是很好的角色目标，可以与现有的角色或政党目标结合起来。例如，一个希望驳斥谎言的抄写员可以通过追寻活动整体故事的核心之谜来实现。",
	"Progressions and holdings within this chapter are recommendations only. Ultimately it is up to the GM to determine how the characters within your setting progress, and what holdings are necessary to the gameplay. Additionally, a GM may decide to allow a character to progress within their profession due to alternative reasons, such as circumstantial gameplay, setting requirements, or for any other reason. Players and GMs should discuss what sort of holdings a player could expect to receive at each rank and what progression paths may be available to them.": "本章中的进展和财产仅是建议。最终要由GM来决定角色在你的设定中如何发展，以及哪些持有是游戏中所必需的。此外，由于其他原因，例如环境游戏、设定要求或其他任何原因，GM可以决定允许角色在其职业中取得进展。玩家和GM应该讨论玩家在每个等级可以得到什么样的财产，以及他们可以有什么样的进步途径。",
	"Talents are unique dispositions, experiences, or characteristics your character has picked up due to their time working in their profession.

	"Plans never play out as expected, and sometimes professions don't either. A character may change professions by achieving the progression requirements of the profession rank they wish to change to. When they achieve these requirements they may rank up into the new rank of that profession, choosing a Talent from their new profession list. A character that has ranked up into another profession retains all equipment, Talents, proficiencies, and abilities from their original profession. After all, you can change your future, but not your past.": "计划永远不会按预期进行，有时职业也不会如此。一个角色可以通过达到他们想要改变的职业等级的进展要求来改变职业。当他们达到这些要求时，他们可以升级到该职业的新等级，从新职业列表中选择一个天赋。升级到另一职业的角色将保留其原来职业的所有装备、天赋、熟练度和能力。毕竟，你可以改变你的未来，但不能改变你的过去。",
	"For example, Aylea is a Militarist Field Marshal. A recent brush with a dark sorcerer has confirmed her faith in her deity, and now she wishes to become an Inquisitor. Aylea's player discusses with their GM what sort of holdings and progression milestones Aylea must achieve to rank into Inquisitor. Due to her seasoned military experience, the GM decides that once contact has been made with a Chapter Master, Aylea will become an Inquisitor at the rank of Initiate, a rank from which Aylea is likely to advance quickly.": "例如，Aylea是一名军国主义的元帅。最近与一个黑暗巫师的交锋证实了她对神的信仰，现在她希望成为一名审问者。Aylea的玩家与他们的GM讨论了Aylea必须达到什么样的持有量和进展里程碑才能晋升为审问者。由于她有丰富的军事经验，总经理决定，一旦与分会会长取得联系，Aylea将成为一名审神者，级别为入门级，Aylea很可能很快就会从这个级别晋升。",

	"Etharis is a land of magic and terror, of rising nations and crumbling empires. Humans have dominated the continent for centuries, but since the death of the gods every form of power is tenuous. From the ancient Charneault Kingdom to the bustling port of Morencia, the ambitious and the desperate vie for control. From the frigid Valikan expanse to the sweltering Castinellan coast, societies mobilize to combat invading armies and mystical forces that threaten civilization itself.": "Etharis是一片充满魔法和恐怖的土地，有崛起的国家和崩溃的帝国。几个世纪以来，人类一直统治着这片大陆，但自从诸神死亡后，每一种形式的权力都很脆弱。从古老的Charneault王国到繁华的Morencia港口，野心家和绝望者争相控制。从寒冷的瓦利坎大草原到炎热的卡斯蒂内兰海岸，各个社会都在动员起来，对抗威胁文明本身的入侵军队和神秘力量。",
	"Nestled in the northern region of Etharis, the Bürach Empire presides over its domain like an old lion ravaged by illness. Once a beacon for grand civilisations everywhere, it is now a shattered nation, a nest of corrupt nobility seeking to revive old glories, lurking monsters that prey on the unwary, and desperate common folk trying to survive both.": "比拉赫帝国坐落在伊萨利斯北部地区，像一头被疾病蹂躏的老狮子一样主持着它的领域。它曾经是各地宏伟文明的灯塔，现在是一个支离破碎的国家，一个腐败的贵族寻求重振旧日辉煌的巢穴，潜伏的怪物捕食不小心的人，以及绝望的普通人试图在两者之间生存。",
	"Though it is still viewed by most of its neighbours as the political, military, and economic superpower of Etharis, those within the Bürach Empire live each day with the sense that the end is near. Whether that end comes by war, cults of strange gods, rebellion, economic collapse, or the otherworldly threat of the Beast, the Empire is seeing its last days.": "虽然它仍然被大多数邻国视为Etharis的政治、军事和经济超级大国，但布拉克帝国的人们每天都生活在末日来临的感觉中。无论这个末日是由战争、奇怪的神的崇拜、叛乱、经济崩溃，还是野兽的其他世界的威胁带来的，帝国正在看到它最后的日子。",
	"The Bürach Empire once covered the largest expanse of land of any nation in Etharis. Temperate forests abound at the northern edge, but dwindle the further one travels south as logging camps struggle to keep up with the Empire's demand for lumber. The foothills of the Grey Spine mountain range provide a source of iron and precious gems. A major volcano, Mt. Vengeance, lies to the east of the Empire.": "比拉赫帝国曾经是伊萨利斯所有国家中覆盖面积最大的国家。北部边缘有很多温带森林，但越往南就越少，因为伐木营地要努力满足帝国对木材的需求。灰刺山脉的山脚下提供了铁和珍贵宝石的来源。一座主要的火山，复仇山，位于帝国的东部。",
	"The Bürach began as a group of neighbouring tribes that settled in the north eastern part of Etharis. Over the years, some of these tribes grew in size and stature, and either conquered or absorbed other tribes. Thus, they became the Bürach, which in the olden tongue means \"One Above All\".": "布拉克人最初是一群定居在伊萨里斯东北部的邻近部落。多年来，其中一些部落的规模和地位不断扩大，要么征服了其他部落，要么吸收了其他部落。因此，他们成为了比拉赫（Bürach），在古语中意为 \"一统天下\"。",
	"The people of the Bürach are creatures of tradition, living their lives in lock-step with religious beliefs, family ties, fealty to their Empire, and laws so ancient that few historians even remember why they were made.": "比拉赫人是传统的产物，他们的生活与宗教信仰、家庭纽带、对帝国的忠诚以及古老的法律紧密相连，甚至很少有历史学家记得为什么会制定这些法律。",
	"The Empire follows a caste system, with the royalty at the top, followed by the nobility, the knights, the merchants, the craftsmen, and then finally, the serfs. Their society is structured around fealty to a particular noble family. Each province must abide by the rules of their lords and common born serfs may not leave the land of their birth without permission.": "帝国遵循种姓制度，最高层是皇室，其次是贵族、骑士、商人、手工业者，最后是农奴。他们的社会结构是围绕着对某一特定贵族家庭的效忠。每个省都必须遵守其领主的规则，普通出生的农奴未经许可不得离开其出生地。",
	"Those caught abandoning their lords, either by running away or breaking their laws, are dealt with severely.": "那些被发现抛弃领主的人，无论是逃跑还是违反领主的法律，都会受到严厉的处理。",
	"Though a single empire, the Bürach is not homogeneous. Four distinct groups of people gathered into provinces, with each devoted to their own particular god, and those divisions have survived even if the gods have not.": "虽然是一个单一的帝国，但比拉赫并不是同质化的。四个不同的人群聚集成省，每个人都献给自己的特定神灵，即使神灵不在了，这些划分也一直存在着。",
	"The Abendfolk are devotees of Aurelia, goddess of healing and protection. Their city of Altenheim forms the cultural and economic heart of the Bürach Empire.": "阿本德福克人是奥蕾莉亚的信徒，她是治疗和保护的女神。他们的城市Altenheim构成了Bürach帝国的文化和经济中心。",
	"The wise Norden settled in the north, where they worship Ulmyr, the embodiment of magic and chaos. Nordenland is culturally divided, with the west populated by a mix of various races, with the east primarily peopled by outlanders.": "聪明的诺登人在北方定居，他们在那里崇拜乌尔米尔，魔法和混乱的化身。诺登大陆在文化上是分裂的，西部由各种种族混合居住，东部主要由外乡人居住。",
	"To the east, closest to the Grey Spine Mountains, lies Unterland. The Unterfolk follow the ways of Maligant, god of war and conquest.": "在东部，最靠近灰刺山的地方是Unterland。翁特兰人信奉战争和征服之神马利根特的方式。",
	"Finally, to the south lies Rauland, whose people carry on their worship of Galt the Builder, god of order and construction.": "最后，南部是劳兰，其人民继续崇拜秩序和建筑之神--建设者高特。",
	"As these provinces grew in power, foreign kingdoms soon challenged them, coveting their lands. The people turned to the gods for aid. The Four Divines agreed that the burgeoning Empire needed a central figure around which they could rally. Appearing to each of their priests, the Four advised the Bürach to form an empire.": "随着这些省份实力的增长，外国王国很快向他们发起挑战，觊觎他们的土地。人们向诸神寻求援助。四神同意，新兴的帝国需要一个中心人物，他们可以团结在这个中心人物周围。四神出现在每个祭司面前，建议布拉赫人建立一个帝国。",
	"The priests, known as the Hearthkeepers of Aurelia, searched far and wide for signs of one who would be the emperor.": "被称为奥瑞利亚守炉人的祭司们，在远处和近处寻找将成为皇帝的人的迹象。",
	"Though they met many a knight, noble, and mage, none was deemed fit for the title.": "虽然他们遇到了许多骑士、贵族和法师，但没有人被认为适合这个称号。",
	"Then their visions led them to the western marches. Here they found a 12-year-old boy named Thancred, who had single-handedly slain a giant that guarded a fjord so that he could build a bridge between two towns. When the Hearthkeepers came before him, they watched as he returned a dead lamb back to life with just his hands. As one, the priests fell to their knees and named him Emperor Indorius, first of his line.": "然后，他们的幻觉把他们带到了西部的大草原。在这里，他们发现了一个名叫桑克莱德的12岁男孩，他单枪匹马地杀死了一个守卫峡湾的巨人，这样他就可以在两个城镇之间建造一座桥。当守炉人来到他面前时，他们看到他仅用双手就使一只死去的羔羊复活了。祭司们齐刷刷地跪下来，将他命名为因多里乌斯皇帝，这是他家族的第一人。",
	"As a gift to the new emperor, the four gods poured their divinity into four sacred artifacts: a crown that radiated authority (Galt), a sword that increased his might (Maligant), an orb that gave him far sight (Ulmyr), and a breastplate that protected him from harm (Aurelia).": "作为给新皇帝的礼物，四位神将他们的神性倾注在四件神圣的神器中：一顶散发着权威的王冠（Galt），一把增加他力量的剑（Maligant），一个让他获得远方视力的球体（Ulmyr），以及一件保护他免受伤害的胸甲（Aurelia）。",
	"With these treasures and the support of his people, the emperor launched a campaign against his nation's rivals. With sword and banner, he led the combined army of the four provinces into war. Victory after victory followed him until the surrounding nations were conquered and folded into Bürach. This created an empire that stretched from one end of the continent to the other, the largest nation in all of Etharis.": "有了这些财宝和人民的支持，皇帝对他的国家的对手发起了一场战役。他带着剑和旗帜，带领四个省的联合军队投入战争。一场又一场的胜利伴随着他，直到周围的国家被征服并折服于比拉赫。这创造了一个从大陆的一端延伸到另一端的帝国，是整个伊萨里斯最大的国家。",
	"With his empire secured, Emperor Indorius implemented ambitious changes throughout the land. He standardised trade and created guilds for building infrastructure. By establishing coastal settlements, he freed the Bürach from centuries as a land-locked people. A patron of the arts, he encouraged bards and musicians to flourish in his court. When Emperor Indorius finally entered the afterlife, the Empire had become a nation of wealth and enlightenment.": "帝国稳固后，因多里乌斯皇帝在整个国家实施了雄心勃勃的变革。他规范了贸易，并为建设基础设施创建了行会。通过建立沿海定居点，他将比拉赫人从几个世纪的内陆民族中解放出来。作为艺术的赞助人，他鼓励吟游诗人和音乐家在他的宫廷中蓬勃发展。当因多里乌斯皇帝最终进入来世时，帝国已经成为一个富裕和启蒙的国家。",
	"This greatness would not last. The gods who had answered the Bürach's prayers were themselves the survivors of a disastrous war. Only time would reveal the wounds they had suffered fighting enemies beyond even divine comprehension. Surely the gods' minds were already tainted when they chose Indorius, for the seeds of empire they planted were the seeds of their own madness and destruction.": "这种伟大不会持久。响应布拉克人祈祷的诸神本身就是一场灾难性战争的幸存者。只有时间才能揭示他们在与甚至是神明都无法理解的敌人作战时所受到的创伤。当然，诸神在选择因多里乌斯时，他们的思想已经被玷污了，因为他们种下的帝国的种子就是他们自己疯狂和毁灭的种子。",
	"So great was the impact of Indorius's rule that the Bürach instituted what would be known as the Edict of Eternal Blood. According to this law, only one of the emperor's direct descendants could be raised to the throne.": "因多里乌斯的统治影响如此之大，以至于比拉赫制定了后来被称为 \"永恒的血统 \"的法令。根据这项法律，只有皇帝的一个直系后裔可以被提升到王位。",
	"The Hearthkeepers took great care to preserve the purity of the imperial family. Cousins and sometimes siblings were led to marry in order to maintain the Edict. However, many voices across the Bürach warned against such acts, but their words fell on deaf ears. Encouraged by the priesthood, the people's faith in the Imperial family kept the government in power, and for centuries all was right in the world.": "守炉人非常注意维护皇室的纯洁性。表兄弟，有时是兄弟姐妹被引导结婚，以维护诏书。然而，整个比拉赫的许多声音都在警告不要有这样的行为，但他们的话却充耳不闻。在神职人员的鼓励下，人民对皇室的信仰使政府保持了权力，几个世纪以来，世界上一切都很正常。",
	"That changed with Emperor Leopold I.": "这在利奥波德一世皇帝那里得到了改变。",
	"From a young age, it was clear that Leopold was truly, irrevocably mad. He often spoke to things that weren't there and treated people like they were insects, having servants imprisoned and flayed for the smallest infractions. Officials whispered among themselves that they could not in good conscience put him into power, but to disobey the Edict was to invite disaster for the government. Thus, one summer solstice, Leopold was crowned Emperor of the Bürach.": "从很小的时候起，就可以看出利奥波德是真正的、不可逆转的疯子。他经常对着不存在的东西说话，对待人就像对待昆虫一样，因为最小的违规行为就把仆人关进监狱和剥皮。官员们相互之间窃窃私语，说他们不能凭良心让他上台，但不服从敕令就是给政府带来灾难。因此，在一个夏至日，利奥波德被加冕为比拉赫的皇帝。",
	"Possessed by religious fervour, Leopold exhorted the masses to believe that only one of the four gods should rule supreme. Why should they each follow four, when only one--the greatest, most powerful of all--was deserving of their devotion?": "在宗教狂热的驱使下，利奥波德劝说群众相信，四位神灵中只有一位应该是最高统治者。为什么他们每个人都要追随四个，而只有一个--最伟大的、最强大的--值得他们奉献？",
	"Each sect then began to argue that their god should be the One True Deity.": "然后每个教派都开始争论，他们的神应该是唯一的真神。",
	"Leopold's madness seeped into the four artifacts he wore. Worse, as these artifacts carried the essences of the four gods, his madness fed back into their minds, driving them insane.": "利奥波德的疯狂渗入了他佩戴的四件神器。更糟的是，由于这些神器携带着四位神的精华，他的疯狂又反馈到他们的头脑中，使他们陷入疯狂。",
	"The Four Divines turned on each other, each believing they should be the One True God. The gods warred in the heavens, causing calamities such as storms, flash fires, and earthquakes. Their hostility quickly spread to their worshippers. Within a year, the Bürach Empire had descended into civil war as the four provinces fought among themselves.": "四位神灵相互争斗，各自认为自己应该是唯一的真神。诸神在天上争斗，造成风暴、山火和地震等灾难。他们的敌意迅速蔓延到他们的崇拜者身上。一年之内，由于四个省之间的争斗，布拉克帝国陷入了内战。",
	"To end the violence, individuals from the four provinces conspired against the emperor. Their assassins swept into the imperial palace and killed Leopold. With his death, the sacred artifacts disappeared. This caused the Divine Aurelia to come out of her insanity long enough to see that the gods' battles would soon destroy all of Etharis. She then used all her power to shield the land from the gods' war. In so doing, she gave up her own life. In time the other three—Maligant, Ulmyr, and Galt—slew each other.": "为了结束暴力，来自四个省的个人密谋反对皇帝。他们的刺客们冲进皇宫，杀死了利奥波德。随着他的死亡，神圣的文物消失了。这使神圣的奥蕾莉亚从她的疯狂中清醒过来，看到诸神的战斗很快就会摧毁整个伊萨里斯。于是她用她所有的力量来保护这片土地不受诸神之战的影响。在此过程中，她放弃了自己的生命。随着时间的推移，其他三个Maligant、Ulmyr和Galt互相残杀。",
	"The death of the Four Divines sent a shockwave of magic throughout the Empire. Divine magic still exists, but is now believed to radiate from the remaining Arch Seraphs and Daemons, not from the dead gods themselves.": "四神的死亡给整个帝国带来了魔法的冲击波。神圣的魔法仍然存在，但现在被认为是由剩余的大蛇夫和大魔王放射出来的，而不是由死去的神灵本身。",
	"The leaders of each province called for a ceasefire, and each army retreated to their land to heal and recover from their losses. A new emperor, Aratron I, was installed and provided counterfeit sacred artifacts to shore up the people's faith. This emperor served only as a figurehead; the Hearthkeeper ministers of Aurelia were now the real power behind the throne.": "每个省的领导人都呼吁停火，每支军队都撤退到他们的土地上，以治疗和恢复他们的损失。一个新的皇帝，阿拉特伦一世，被扶植起来，并提供假冒的圣物来支撑人民的信仰。这位皇帝只是作为一个形象代言人；奥里利亚的守炉人大臣们现在才是王位背后的真正力量。",
	"With the absence of the gods, something began to stalk the lands of the Bürach Empire. Unknown what it is, no one is certain how it came to be, but this powerful and corrupting presence has made itself felt throughout countless towns and cities. Eyewitnesses describe it as a towering figure wreathed in shadows, its head an enormous deer skull, bearing a crown of antlers that seem to pierce the sky. It walks where it wills. It corrupts that which it touches. It whispers into the hearts of men and turns them to wickedness.": "随着众神的离去，一些东西开始在布拉克帝国的土地上徘徊。没有人知道它是什么，也没有人确定它是如何出现的，但这个强大而腐朽的存在已经在无数的城镇和城市中显现。目击者描述它是一个被阴影笼罩的高大身影，它的头是一个巨大的鹿头骨，带着一个似乎能刺穿天空的鹿角冠。它在它想去的地方行走。它腐蚀了它所接触的东西。它在人的心中窃窃私语，使他们走向邪恶。",
	"Soon, aberrations and abominations started appearing throughout the provinces. Discord and corruption seeped through every fibre of society.": "很快，各省开始出现反常和可憎的现象。不和谐和腐败渗入了社会的每根纤维。",
	"The creature presents an existential threat to all the imperial provinces, but each threat seems to be unique in nature. In Abendland, mobs of zombie-like creatures, their flesh fused together into a cancerous, many-limbed blob, attack wayfarers and peasants. In Rauland, puppet-like creatures strangle and dismember innocent folk with razor-sharp strings. Nordenland is plagued by corrupted flora and fauna, including treants with human heads and limbs instead of branches. Finally, Unterland has reported sightings of corrupted warriors, their armour melted into their flesh, roaming the countryside and killing indiscriminately.": "这种生物对帝国的所有省份都构成了生存威胁，但每个威胁的性质似乎都很独特。在阿本德兰，一群僵尸般的生物，它们的肉体融合在一起，形成一个癌变的、多肢体的圆球，攻击着路人和农民。在劳兰（Rauland），类似木偶的生物用锋利的绳子勒死和肢解无辜的人。诺登兰（Nordenland）被腐败的植物和动物所困扰，包括长着人头和四肢而不是树枝的树人。最后，Unterland报告说，有人看到被腐蚀的战士，他们的盔甲被融化在肉里，在乡间游荡，肆意杀人。",
	"The Bürach have named this entity the Beast. The four provinces have each formed bands of warriors, clerics, and mages to combat its threat, but though they kill hordes of its monsters, none have succeeded in facing the Beast and living to tell the tale. And where it goes, monsters arise.": "布拉赫人将这个实体命名为 \"野兽\"。四个省分别组建了由战士、牧师和法师组成的队伍来对抗它的威胁，但尽管他们杀死了成群的怪物，却没有人能够成功面对野兽并活下来讲述这个故事。它走到哪里，怪物就出现在哪里。",
	"Four ancient provinces make up the Bürach Empire, each with their own distinct cultures and traditions.": "四个古老的省份组成了比拉赫帝国，每个省份都有自己独特的文化和传统。",
	"Abendland is the region where Aurelia, Goddess of Healing, Hearth, and Home, perished. A part of her celestial body rests within the province, where it still radiates a small part of her sacred magic.": "阿本德兰是治疗、炉灶和家庭女神奥瑞莉娅殒命的地区。她的一部分天体安放在该省内，在那里仍然散发着她神圣魔法的一小部分。",
	"The capital city of Altenheim is the largest city in the Bürach Empire. As the saying goes, \"All roads lead to Altenheim.\" Trade routes eventually find their way here, some from as far away as Grarjord. It is also the safest location in all of the Empire, as Altenheim is known for its high walls and towers that make a siege unlikely to succeed.": "首都阿尔滕海姆是比拉赫帝国的最大城市。俗话说，\"条条大路通阿尔滕海姆\"。贸易路线最终都会找到这里，有的甚至来自遥远的格拉乔德。它也是整个帝国最安全的地方，因为阿尔滕海姆以其高墙和塔楼而闻名，使围攻不太可能成功。",
	"Since time immemorial, Abendland had been ruled by the Holy Church of the Hearthkeepers, clerics of the goddess Aurelia. According to legend, Aurelia herself led the first of her priests, Amara, to the western plains in order to escape the tyrannical ruler of her former tribe. There, the goddess ordered Amara to strike the arid ground with her spear. From that spot emerged a spring of crystal clear water. The spring became the sacred lake, Osea, which fed the land and the city of Altenheim, until it turned verdant and green.": "自古以来，阿本德兰就被炉灶守护者的神圣教会所统治，他们是奥蕾莉亚女神的神职人员。根据传说，奥瑞利亚亲自带领她的第一位牧师阿玛拉来到西部平原，以逃避她以前部落的暴虐统治者。在那里，女神命令阿玛拉用她的长矛敲击干旱的土地。从那个地方出现了一个清澈的泉水。这股泉水成为神圣的湖泊，Osea，它滋养了土地和阿尔滕海姆市，直到它变成了青翠的绿色。",
	"Abendland's open plains, situated in the clearings between dense forest, facilitated farmlands and plantations, feeding its growing population. The Hearthkeepers encouraged and spread the worship of Aurelia, promising peace and prosperity to all who followed her. And many did. Abendland consequently became known as the land of clerics and paladins, and Altenheim gained the title of \"The City of Joy\".": "阿本德兰的开阔平原位于密林之间的空地上，为农田和种植园提供了便利，养活了不断增长的人口。守炉人鼓励并传播对奥蕾莉亚的崇拜，向所有追随她的人承诺和平与繁荣。许多人都这样做了。阿本德兰因此被称为牧师和圣骑士的土地，而阿尔滕海姆则获得了 \"欢乐之城 \"的称号。",
	"When Emperor Indorious was crowned, the Hearthkeepers welcomed him with open arms. He was the only son of Aurelia, they said, the promise of the goddess made flesh. They threw all their power and resources into supporting his rule, and taught the Abendfolk from youth to revere the Emperor. Thus, the Imperial family and the Hearthkeeper religion became tied together forever as a political body. For centuries, the clerics have legitimised the rule of each Emperor, and used their influence to keep his bloodline pure.": "当英多瑞斯皇帝登基时，守炉人张开双臂欢迎他。他们说，他是奥蕾莉亚的独生子，是女神的承诺成了现实。他们把所有的力量和资源都投入到支持他的统治中，并教导阿本德福克人从年轻时起就崇敬皇帝。因此，皇室和守炉人宗教作为一个政治机构永远地绑在了一起。几个世纪以来，神职人员使每一位皇帝的统治合法化，并利用他们的影响力来保持皇帝血统的纯正。",
	"The coming of Leopold I brought an end to this golden age. His madness seeped into Aurelia's holy artifact, the Hearthfire Breastplate, and reached the mind of the goddess herself.": "利奥波德一世的到来结束了这个黄金时代。他的疯狂渗入了奥蕾莉亚的神圣神器--炉火胸甲，并到达了女神本人的脑海。",
	"Aurelia became jealous of her people's devotion. She demanded adoration, prayers, tributes, a lifetime of servitude from her followers, all while fawning over Leopold. In the end, she even demanded blood sacrifices. All of this was an effort to show she was the one true god, the most deserving of worship. As for her priests, they willingly followed her whims and those of the emperor. They had lived too long in the comfort of authority to give it up.": "奥蕾莉亚开始嫉妒她的人民的奉献精神。她要求崇拜、祈祷、进贡，要求她的追随者终生效忠，同时向利奥波德献媚。最后，她甚至要求用血来献祭。所有这些都是为了表明她是唯一的真神，是最值得崇拜的人。至于她的祭司们，他们心甘情愿地追随她和皇帝的奇想。他们在权力的安逸中生活得太久了，无法放弃它。",
	"Finally, Aurelia went to war with the other three gods. Thus distracted, she did not see when one of her priestesses, Talana, turned on her.": "最后，奥蕾莉亚与其他三位神开战。由于分心，她没有看到她的一个女祭司塔拉娜背叛了她。",
	"Conspiring with like-minded individuals from the other three provinces, Talana opened the way for the assassins to infiltrate the Imperial Palace. It worked, and with Leopold dead, the assassins seized control of the artifacts. Galt, Maligant, and Ulmyr remained mad, but Aurelia—perhaps because she was the goddess of protection—managed to break out of her insanity.": "塔拉纳与其他三个省志同道合的人合谋，为刺客潜入皇宫开路。它成功了，随着利奥波德的死亡，刺客们夺取了对神器的控制权。高尔基、马利根和乌尔米尔仍然很疯狂，但奥蕾莉亚--也许是因为她是保护女神--设法摆脱了她的精神错乱。",
	"Seeing the devastation caused by the war, she used all her power to protect her people from the Gods' End. The sacrifice consumed all that was left of her power. Aurelia plunged to Etharis, lifeless.": "看到战争造成的破坏，她用她所有的力量来保护她的人民不受神的毁灭。这一牺牲消耗了她所有剩下的力量。奥瑞莉娅坠落到伊萨里斯，毫无生气。",
	"After the Gods' End, Altenheim did its best to rebuild. The Church of the Hearthkeepers installed a new emperor, replaced the missing artifacts with fakes, and led the people to continue their veneration. But to their horror, the priests found that their clerical abilities were slowly fading as the remnant of Aurelia's power waned from the world. Thus, they withdrew from the public and spread myths among the people: that Aurelia was not dead but merely sleeping, that she would rise again to restore her people to the glory of the Empire's early days.": "诸神终结后，阿尔滕海姆竭尽全力进行重建。守炉人教会扶植了一位新的皇帝，用假货替换了丢失的文物，并带领人们继续崇敬他们。但令他们惊恐的是，牧师们发现，随着奥蕾莉亚的残余力量从世界上消退，他们的神职能力也在慢慢消退。因此，他们退出了公众，并在人民中传播神话：奥蕾莉亚并没有死，只是在沉睡，她会再次复活，让她的人民恢复帝国早期的荣耀。",
	"Soon the concept of \"protection\" took on a different meaning in the City of Joy. The citizens had to be protected from the corruption of the outside world. They had to be brought closer to the light of Aurelia's hearth. They need to be sheltered from the harsh realities of the Gods' End. Dissent among the populace was dealt with harshly. Any talk of a horned shadow monster roaming the lands was silenced.": "很快，\"保护 \"的概念在欢乐之城有了不同的含义。市民们必须受到保护，免受外部世界的腐蚀。他们必须更接近奥瑞利亚的炉灶之光。他们需要得到庇护，免受神之尽头的严酷现实的影响。民众中的异议得到了严厉的处理。任何关于有角的影子怪物在这片土地上游荡的言论都被压制。",
	"It can be said that Altenheim runs on hope, such as it is, as the lands surrounding the province of Abendland were greatly affected by the death of the gods. While still fertile, they are slowly losing potency due to the waning influence of Aurelia.": "可以说，阿尔滕海姆是靠希望来运转的，比如说，阿本德兰省周围的土地受到了诸神死亡的巨大影响。虽然仍然肥沃，但由于奥瑞利亚的影响减弱，它们正在慢慢失去效力。",
	"The city of Altenheim, however, has continued to flourish. Like a tumour syphoning the nutrients from a healthy body, it draws all the wealth and produce from the surrounding province into its coffers. Its vast tracts of farmland still produce enough grain and fruit for trade outside of the empire.": "然而，阿尔滕海姆市却继续蓬勃发展。就像一个肿瘤从健康的身体里吸取营养一样，它把周围省份的财富和产品都吸进了自己的国库。它的大片农田仍然生产足够的谷物和水果，用于帝国以外的贸易。",
	"While the peasants suffered, the city-dwellers took to revelry and worldly pleasures to forget the horrors of the past and present. Trade routes to the Valikan clans brought in a supply of Dreams Leave, an addictive substance that soon had many citizens in its grip.": "在农民受苦的同时，城市居民开始狂欢和享受世俗的快乐，以忘记过去和现在的恐怖。通往瓦利坎部族的贸易路线带来了梦假的供应，这种令人上瘾的物质很快就使许多市民陷入其中。",
	"The walls of Altenheim grew taller and thicker over the years, to guard its wealth and secrets against would-be thieves--but more importantly, to keep its citizens from looking to the world outside.": "多年来，阿尔滕海姆的城墙越来越高，越来越厚，以保护其财富和秘密，防止可能的盗贼，但更重要的是，防止其公民看向外面的世界。",
	"{@i {@b Pope Roland Murrich}} - The leader of the Hearthkeeper Church and the right hand of the emperor himself, Pope Murrich is a shrewd, ruthless leader whose aim is to keep the Church in power. To this end, he oversees a system of tithes from the populace, selling indulgences and holy favours for money. The Hearthkeepers also seek to keep the hearts of the people close to the Holy Church and to the emperor. From childhood, citizens are taught to venerate the Imperial Family as the chosen leaders of Aurelia.": "{@i {@b Pope Roland Murrich}}--作为守炉人教会的领袖和皇帝本人的右手，教皇穆里奇是一个精明、无情的领袖，其目的是保持教会的权力。为此，他监管着一个向民众征收什一税的系统，为了钱而出售纵容和圣宠。守炉人还试图让人们的心贴近神圣的教会和皇帝。从童年开始，公民就被教导要崇敬皇室家族，将其视为奥瑞利亚的选定领袖。",
	"Murrich dotes on Aratron II like his own son, though his detractors accuse him of simply using the boy to prop up the Church's authority. His current obsession is to recapture the missing artifacts of the Emperor in the hopes of accessing the remaining power of the gods. His efforts have yet to bear fruit.": "穆里奇像爱护自己的儿子一样爱护阿拉特隆二世，尽管他的反对者指责他只是利用这个孩子来支撑教会的权威。他目前的痴迷是夺回皇帝失踪的文物，希望能获得诸神的剩余力量。他的努力还没有结果。",
	"{@i {@b Gatekeeper Chantal Sommerkin}} - A charismatic if rather unhinged woman, Sommerkin is the leader of the Celestial Gate, a doomsday cult that has grown to rival the Hearthkeeper Church in the Abendland countryside.": "{@i {@b Gatekeeper Chantal Sommerkin}}--萨默金是一个有魅力但相当不正常的女人，她是天门的领袖，一个已经发展到可以与阿本德兰乡村的守炉人教会相媲美的末日邪教。",
	"The Celestial Gate believes that the world is irredeemably corrupt, and the only thing that can be done is to start over in the next one. With the growing threat of the Beast, the cult offers people a way to prepare their souls for the next life. Their current aim, aside from growing their membership, is to depose the current emperor and make Abendland a full theocracy in preparation for the end of the world.": "天门教认为，这个世界已经无可救药地腐败了，唯一能做的就是在下一个世界重新开始。随着野兽的威胁越来越大，该邪教为人们提供了一种为来世准备灵魂的方法。他们目前的目标，除了增加他们的成员外，就是废黜现任皇帝，使阿本德兰成为一个完全的神权国家，为世界末日做准备。",
	"{@i {@b Emperor Aratron II}} - Only 12 years old at the time of his coronation, the young Aratron knows little of the world outside of his palace. Kept a virtual prisoner in his own home, the bored Emperor spends his time reading the Church-approved books sent to his quarters, or attending one lavish ball after another. He is merely counting the days until his inevitable marriage to a cousin when he turns 16.": "{@i {@b Emperor Aratron II}}--加冕时只有12岁，年轻的阿拉特隆对皇宫外的世界知之甚少。这位无聊的皇帝在自己家里几乎成了囚犯，他把时间花在阅读教会批准的书籍上，或者参加一个又一个奢华的舞会。他只是在数着日子，直到他16岁时不可避免地与一个表妹结婚。",
	"Anyone who is able to gain an audience with the young emperor will find him as haughty, sullen, and remote as any member of the royal family. However, Aratron will light up if the visitor mentions tales of other lands. Such a visitor will find themselves questioned relentlessly for every scrap of information, particularly about seafaring. The emperor is innocent of the ways of the world and constantly relies on the advice of his staff and of Pope Murrich.": "任何能够获得这位年轻皇帝接见的人都会发现他和任何皇室成员一样傲慢、沉闷和遥远。然而，如果来访者提到其他国家的故事，阿拉特伦就会眼前一亮。这样的访客会发现他们被无情地询问每一个信息，特别是关于航海的信息。皇帝对世界的方式是无辜的，并不断依靠他的工作人员和教皇穆里奇的建议。",
	"The mysterious forest dwellers of Nordenland are an ancient race with a strong kinship to magic and faerie folk. The Norden inhabit a region of lush woods, hills, narrow rivers, and sheer cliffs, all of which hide their own kind of secrets. The capital of the province is Erlefurt, a city in West Nordenland that houses various colleges devoted to each branch of magic.": "诺登大陆的神秘森林居民是一个古老的种族，与魔法和精灵有很强的亲缘关系。诺登人居住在一个由郁郁葱葱的树林、山丘、狭窄的河流和陡峭的悬崖组成的地区，所有这些地方都隐藏着自己的秘密。该省的首府是埃尔富特（Erlefurt），这是一个位于西诺登地区的城市，里面有各种专门研究各个魔法分支的学院。",
	"Nordenland is a province divided. Those that hew to the Bürach Empire reside in the western region, where they have raised a city much like those in other provinces. Those who reside in the east have abandoned their oaths to the emperor and reverted to the Old Ways, living closer to nature. The forests and bogs of eastern Nordenland contain the roots, berries, and fruits that they use in their magic rituals.": "诺登兰是一个分裂的省份。忠于布拉赫帝国的人居住在西部地区，他们在那里建立了一个和其他省份一样的城市。居住在东部的人放弃了对皇帝的誓言，恢复了旧有的生活方式，更加贴近自然。诺登兰东部的森林和沼泽里有他们用于魔法仪式的根茎、浆果和水果。",
	"The ancient province of Nordenland sits on the threshold of a variety of other dimensions, including that of the faerie realm. The presence of otherworldly beings constantly exposes the Norden to magical events and creatures. As such, they have the largest number of mages and druids in the Empire.": "古老的诺丁兰省坐落在各种其他维度的门槛上，包括精灵界的门槛。其他世界生物的存在使诺登人不断接触到神奇的事件和生物。因此，他们拥有帝国中数量最多的法师和德鲁伊。",
	"The god Ulmyr emerged from one of these interdimensional rifts. When he beheld the Norden, he saw a people he could call his own. He gathered the scattered tribes into one mighty clan and helped them to hone their arcane potential.": "乌尔米尔神从这些跨维裂缝中的一个出现。当他看到北欧人时，他看到了一个他可以称之为自己的民族。他将分散的部落聚集成一个强大的部族，并帮助他们磨练自己的魔法潜能。",
	"When Emperor Indorious was crowned, Ulmyr joined with the other gods into a united pantheon. The Norden followed their god and Nordenland became a province of the fledgling Bürach Empire.": "当英多瑞斯皇帝登基后，乌尔姆尔与其他神灵一起组成了一个统一的万神殿。诺登人追随他们的神，诺登地区成为新生的比拉赫帝国的一个省。",
	"Many Norden had misgivings over this move, as they had preferred their ways to those of a foreign power. This simmering anger did not wane with time. As the towns and cities of the other provinces sprang up at their borders, the Norden found their territory shrinking and their influence diminishing. The neighboring province of Rauland's need for timber lured loggers to the Norden forests, which in turn weakened the magic of the realm. Infuriated, the Norden fought a war to reclaim their lost territory but were outnumbered. Eventually, they were forced to accept an armistice and agree to new boundaries.": "许多诺登人对这一举动心存疑虑，因为他们更喜欢自己的方式，而不是一个外国势力的方式。这种沸腾的愤怒并没有随着时间的推移而减弱。随着其他省份的城镇在他们的边界兴起，诺登人发现他们的领土在缩小，他们的影响力也在减弱。邻近的劳兰省对木材的需求将伐木者引向诺登森林，这反过来又削弱了王国的魔法。被激怒的诺登人发动了一场战争，以夺回他们失去的领土，但却寡不敌众。最终，他们被迫接受停战并同意新的边界。",
	"With the Gods' End occurring, everything fell to chaos. Conflict broke out amongst the provinces as the gods ordered their followers to fight for their glory. Despite their love for Ulmyr, the wisest of the Norden knew that if they continued the war there would be nothing left of their onceproud realm. Thus, they conspired with like-minded individuals from the other provinces to assassinate the emperor.": "随着诸神末日的发生，一切都陷入了混乱。由于诸神命令他们的追随者为他们的荣耀而战，各省之间爆发了冲突。尽管他们热爱乌尔米尔，但最聪明的诺登人知道，如果他们继续战争，他们曾经骄傲的王国将不复存在。因此，他们与其他省份志同道合的人合谋，暗杀皇帝。",
	"With Leopold I dead, the assassins absconded with the four holy artifacts. They were supposed to bring these artifacts to Nordenland in the hope that the wizards could find a way to reverse the gods' madness. But before the artifacts could reach Nordenland, old wounds reopened among the Norden. While the loyalists wanted to restore the Empire, some of the Norden remembered their past humiliations and wanted Nordenland free from imperial rule for good. Those who held the artifacts would have the power to steer the province's future.": "利奥波德一世死后，刺客们带着四件圣物潜逃了。他们本应将这些神器带到诺登堡，希望巫师们能找到一种方法来扭转诸神的疯狂状态。但在神器到达诺登堡之前，诺登人之间的旧伤复发了。虽然忠诚者希望恢复帝国，但一些诺登人记得他们过去的屈辱，希望诺登兰永远摆脱帝国的统治。那些持有神器的人将有能力引导该省的未来。",
	"Fighting broke out over the treasures. Then, to everyone's shock, the artifacts blazed with light, levitated into the air, and vanished. Without a chance to cure their insanity, the gods were left to fight to the death.": "争夺宝物的战斗爆发了。然后，令所有人震惊的是，这些神器闪耀着光芒，悬浮在空中，然后消失了。由于没有机会治愈他们的精神错乱，众神只能拼死一搏。",
	"The strife split the Norden into two factions, each blaming the other for their downfall. Those who believed in the Old Ways gathered in the east. Those who wanted to remain in the Empire kept to the west. The people of East Norden view their Western brethren as blood traitors who abandoned their true family. The Westerners consider those of the East weak and behind the times.": "这场纷争使诺登人分成两派，各自指责对方的衰落。那些相信旧方法的人聚集在东部。那些想留在帝国的人则保持在西部。东诺登的人认为他们的西方兄弟是抛弃了他们真正的家庭的血腥叛徒。西方人认为东方人软弱，落后于时代。",
	"Skirmishes have frequently erupted between the two factions, and it seems a new civil war is in the offing. Both sides continue to search for the missing artifacts in hopes of restoring their god and gaining the upper hand in the conflict.": "两派之间经常爆发小规模冲突，似乎一场新的内战正在酝酿之中。双方都在继续寻找失踪的文物，希望能恢复他们的神，并在冲突中占得上风。",
	"A decade after the Gods' End, woodland life in Nordenland began to change into hideous, deformed versions of themselves that attacked other life indiscriminately. Both sides accused the other of dark magic.": "诸神终结的十年后，诺登兰的林地生命开始转变为狰狞、畸形的自己，肆意攻击其他生命。双方都指责对方使用了黑魔法。",
	"Sighting of the towering antlered figure settled the matter. To this day, mages from both sides are struggling to stop the Beast from corrupting their land any further.": "看到这个高大的鹿角身影就解决了这个问题。时至今日，双方的法师都在努力阻止野兽进一步腐蚀他们的土地。",
	"The Eastern Norden are mostly composed of outlanders of various races. They reside in the woods and swamps, forsaking complex technology and relying on their connection to nature to thrive. Most live in the forests, in treetop villages to keep away from the magical beasts that wander their domain. Tribes are led by chieftains, who themselves answer to their leader, the Patriarch.": "东部诺登人主要由不同种族的外乡人组成。他们居住在森林和沼泽中，放弃了复杂的技术，依靠与自然的联系来繁衍。大多数人住在森林里，住在树顶上的村庄里，以避开游荡在他们领域的魔兽。部落由酋长领导，他们自己对他们的领袖--族长负责。",
	"Their xenophobic tendencies have kept foreigners and trade away, though it is not unknown for their mages to take in foreign apprentices who swear fealty to East Norden.": "他们的排外倾向使外国人和贸易远离他们，尽管他们的法师接收那些宣誓效忠于东诺登的外国学徒也不是没有。",
	"The Westerners, on the other hand, insist that modernisation is the way forward. They have adopted windmills, waterwheels, and farming tools. They use boats to ply the waterways and trade lumber and dry goods with the other provinces. The large number of coastal villages in their province provide access to saltwater fish that help support their food supply.": "另一方面，西方人坚持认为现代化是前进的方向。他们已经采用了风车、水车和农具。他们用船在水路上行驶，与其他省份进行木材和干货贸易。该省大量的沿海村庄提供了获得咸水鱼的机会，有助于支持他们的食物供应。",
	"The Norden's greatest talent, however, lies in magic. Any mage who aspires to a name in the Bürach Empire goes to Erlefurt in order to gain mastery at one of the famed Great Colleges there. Norden mages are renowned for their skill and intellect, and remain in demand throughout the Empire.": "然而，诺登人最大的才能在于魔法。任何有志于在比拉赫帝国成名的法师都会去艾尔福特，以便在那里著名的大学院中获得精湛的技艺。诺登法师因其技能和智慧而闻名，在整个帝国都很受欢迎。",

	"East Nordenland is ruled by the Patriarch and his Oaken Court. They keep the borders of their forest ensorcelled so that none may enter without their knowing. They do not recognise imperial authority and are willing to fight for their independence. The Empire has little to no influence on East Nordenland, as most of their forces are out fighting wars elsewhere.": "东诺登兰由族长和他的橡木法庭统治。他们把森林的边界封闭起来，没有人可以在他们不知道的情况下进入。他们不承认帝国的权威，愿意为自己的独立而战。帝国对东诺登兰几乎没有任何影响，因为他们的大部分力量都在其他地方打仗。",

Like his imperial opponents, he seeks to find the legendary artifacts in order to protect his homeland and further the cause of his faction.": "{@b {@i Patriarch Alfric}}--阿尔弗里克被称为族长，领导着东诺登王国。他最关心的是将外来者的影响--特别是帝国政府--挡在他的土地之外。阿尔弗里克国王在许多次试图谋杀他的行动中幸存下来，这只会加强他的决心。和他的帝国对手一样，他试图找到传说中的神器，以保护他的祖国并推进他的派别的事业。",
	"{@b {@i Arch Duchess Maelfa}} - The leader of the West Norden Kingdom.

	"The Bürach came to rely on the craftsmanship of the Raulfolk. Thousands came to the Raulish guilds to learn carpentry, smithing, architecture, and construction.

No one was allowed to rise above their station or to leave the province.": "当疯狂降临到高尔特身上时，他要求的是完全的秩序。以任务主管的方式，他命令一切都要按时进行，产品要像钟表一样被制造和销售。建筑物不断上升，成千上万的武器被锻造出来并运往各地，人们像奴隶一样工作。没有人被允许超越他们的地位或离开该省。",

	"Unable to stand this madness any longer, a handful of Raulish sages made a pact with the other provinces. The Raulfolk secretly forged daggers that would be undetectable to the seers of the Imperial Palace. Thus, assassins were able to steal into the imperial palace and kill Emperor Leopold.": "由于无法再忍受这种疯狂的行为，少数劳尔人的圣人与其他省份达成了协议。劳尔人秘密地锻造了匕首，使皇宫的预言家们无法察觉。因此，刺客们得以偷入皇宫，杀死利奥波德皇帝。",
	"Though they were freed from their mad god, life only marginally improved for the Raulfolk. Their wares remain popular throughout the Empire, but without Galt's guidance their craft began to decline in potency over the years. Border disputes with Unterland arose, and their need for timber led to conflict with nearby Nordenland.": "虽然他们从疯狂的神那里获得了自由，但劳尔福克人的生活只是稍有改善。他们的产品在整个帝国仍然很受欢迎，但没有了高尔特的指导，他们的手艺在这些年里开始衰退。与Unterland的边界争端出现了，他们对木材的需求导致了与附近Nordenland的冲突。",
	"Worst of all, something now stalks the Raulish countryside and the smog-ridden streets of the capital--something that turns citizens into monstrosities that prey on the innocent.": "最糟糕的是，现在有一种东西在劳尔人的乡村和首都烟雾弥漫的街道上游荡--这种东西把公民变成了捕食无辜者的怪物。",
	"Though the guards keep watch all night, the threat has not abated. The Beast haunts the Raulfolk, and thus far none have been able to stop it.": "尽管守卫们整夜守卫，但威胁并没有减少。野兽困扰着劳尔福克，到目前为止，没有人能够阻止它。",
	"Stehlenwald's main trade is in metalworks including jewelry, tools, and above all, weaponry. The excellence of their products comes from more than their choice of raw materials and system for folded steel; the Raulfolk have honed their craft into an art form, something that can only be replicated by magic. Raulish weapons hold an edge better and endure longer than others made by lesser smiths.": "Stehlenwald的主要行业是金属制品，包括珠宝、工具，以及最重要的武器装备。他们产品的卓越性不仅仅来自于他们对原材料的选择和钢铁的折叠系统；劳尔人已经将他们的工艺磨练成了一种艺术形式，这种艺术形式只有通过魔法才能复制。劳尔人的武器比其他较差的铁匠所制造的武器更能保持锋利，也更持久。",
	"Nowadays, their economy is on a downturn due to the decline in their weapon quality, from what it once was. Worse, the thick, acrid smoke from the forges has harmed the health and quality of life in the city. Yet, though Raulish weapons no longer live up to their legendary status, armies still require them for the wars along the eastern border. The Raulfolk take what business they can get.": "如今，由于他们的武器质量下降，他们的经济正处于低迷状态，与以前相比。更糟糕的是，来自锻造厂的厚重的、刺鼻的烟雾已经损害了城市的健康和生活质量。然而，尽管劳尔人的武器不再符合他们的传奇地位，但在东部边境的战争中，军队仍然需要它们。劳尔人接受他们所能得到的生意。",
	"{@b {@i Arch Duke Ulrich Eisenherz}} - The dwarven thane of Rauland. A fair-minded and well-loved ruler of the province, he is nevertheless hounded by rumours that he holds one of the imperial artifacts, the Hearthfire Breastplate, in his vault. He has continued to deny this, though an inquiry has been launched by the Hearthkeepers. Most speculate that the duke does not want to raise the ire of the Holy Church, or that he is biding his time to use the artifact. With the ongoing attacks of the Beast, that time may be nigh.": "{@b {@i Arch Duke Ulrich Eisenherz}} - 劳兰的矮人酋长。他是一位心地公正、深受爱戴的统治者，但有传言说他的金库里有一件帝国神器--炉火胸甲，这让他备受困扰。他一直否认这一点，尽管炉火守卫者们已经展开了调查。大多数人猜测，公爵不想引起神圣教会的愤怒，或者他在等待时机使用该神器。随着野兽的不断攻击，这个时间可能已经不远了。",
	"{@b {@i Artom Drago}} - Faced with a mind-bending horror such as the Beast, some Raulfolk have chosen to fight monsters with monsters. Drago, a former agent of Rauland, was disavowed by his own government so that he could undertake a secret mission. Infecting himself and his men with lycanthropy, Drago and his pack roam the countryside at night, hunting down the Beast's creations and tearing them to shreds.": "{@b {@i Artom Drago}}--面对像野兽这样令人心惊肉跳的恐怖事物，一些劳尔人选择以怪兽对抗怪兽。德拉戈(Drago)是劳尔兰的一名前特工，他被自己的政府拒绝，以便他能够执行一项秘密任务。德拉戈和他的手下感染了狼人症，他和他的族群在夜间漫游乡村，追捕野兽的创造者并将他们撕成碎片。",
	"While they have been initially successful, the Norden government fears that Drago and his men are starting to lose themselves to their wolfish natures. If true, they would have to be put down as well.": "虽然他们最初取得了成功，但北欧政府担心德拉戈和他的手下开始迷失自己的狼性。如果是真的，他们也必须被放倒。",
	"The easternmost region of the Bürach Empire, Unterland is a warrior society that seeks to broaden the Empire's reach and renew its flagging momentum. Of all the provinces, Unterland holds a particular bitter rivalry with their neighbour across the Grey Spine, the Ostoyan Empire.": "作为比拉赫帝国最东边的地区，Unterland是一个寻求扩大帝国影响力并重振其衰退势头的战士社会。在所有的省份中，Unterland与他们在灰脊梁上的邻居Ostoyan帝国有着特别激烈的竞争关系。",
	"Unterland began as its own city-state long before the other provinces had united under one banner.": "早在其他省份团结在一个旗帜下之前，Unterland就已经开始成为自己的城邦。",
	"Once a weak tribe of hunters living among the marshlands, the Unter people had the misfortune of being surrounded by hostile tribes. With their best soldiers lost to countless skirmishes, the Unterfolk raised their prayers and offerings the heavens and begged for salvation. It was the god Maligant who answered them.": "曾经是一个生活在沼泽地中的弱小猎人部落，Unter人不幸被敌对部落所包围。随着他们最好的士兵在无数次的小规模冲突中丧生，Unterfolk向天空举起他们的祈祷和祭品，乞求拯救。响应他们的是马利根神。",
	"Maligant proved to be a god of strategy and intelligent warfare. Under his tutelage, the Unters selected adapt generals to lead their troops. They learned to forge strong alliances and dissolve them when they were no longer useful. They also learned to win with surgical precision instead of relying on brute force, and to break the enemy's spirit as well as their armies.": "事实证明，马利根是一位战略和智能战争之神。在他的指导下，Unters选择了适应的将军来领导他们的部队。他们学会了建立强大的联盟，并在它们不再有用时将其解散。他们还学会了以外科手术般的精确性取胜，而不是依靠蛮力，并打破敌人的精神和军队。",
	"Their greatest conflict was undoubtedly the Etienne War, when the Vorkan tribe marched across the border to try and take their lands. However, the Vorkan made the mistake of invading during the wet season. While the Vorkans camped beside a river, the Unterfolk released the water from their dam to flood the banks. More than half the invaders drowned, and the rest were forced to retreat. Thus, the Unterfolk won the Etienne war without losing a single soldier.": "他们最大的冲突无疑是艾蒂安战争，当时沃尔坎部落越过边界，试图夺取他们的土地。然而，Vorkan人犯了一个错误，那就是在雨季入侵。当Vorkan人在一条河边扎营时，Unterfolk人从他们的水坝中放出水来淹没河岸。一半以上的入侵者被淹死，剩下的人被迫撤退。因此，Unterfolk在没有损失一个士兵的情况下赢得了艾蒂安战争。",
	"Soon after, the allied Unter tribes consolidated under one territory: Unterland. They founded their capital of Olstenburg, where rose their most important institution: The Academy of Swords, where the citizenry could learn the military sciences. Every able-bodied youth was sent to the Academy for two years of training and military service.": "不久之后，结盟的Unter部落合并到一个领土之下。Unterland。他们建立了自己的首都奥斯滕堡，在那里建立了最重要的机构。剑术学院，公民可以在这里学习军事科学。每个身体健康的年轻人都被送到学院接受两年的培训和军事服务。",
	"Thus, Unterland managed to grow a trained citizen army that they could field at a moment's notice.": "因此，Unterland设法发展了一支训练有素的公民军队，他们可以在任何时候出动。",
	"Like the other provinces, Unterland joined under one empire when Indorious I came into power. They served a critical function: to defend the nation and expand its borders. In battle, the Unterfolk fielded their heavy cavalry, and infantry composed of pikemen, swordsmen, crossbowmen. When needed, they also employed their hunters to wage guerrilla warfare in forested regions. Theirs was a fighting force without compare.": "与其他省份一样，当印托里斯一世上台后，Unterland也加入了一个帝国的行列。他们发挥着重要的作用：保卫国家和扩大边界。在战斗中，Unterfolk派出了他们的重装骑兵，以及由长矛手、剑手、弩手组成的步兵。必要时，他们还雇用猎人在森林地区开展游击战。他们是一支无与伦比的战斗力量。",
	"However, there were some in Unterland who refused to follow the Empire, seeing it as a form of imprisonment. They left Unterland, crossing the Grey Spine into a new land that they called Ostoya. Their secession would plant the seeds of bitter conflict.": "然而，在Unterland，有一些人拒绝跟随帝国，认为这是一种监禁。他们离开了Unterland，越过灰色的脊柱，进入了一个他们称之为Ostoya的新土地。他们的分离将埋下痛苦冲突的种子。",
	"The Unterfolk sage who joined in the assassination of Emperor Leopold was named Dmitri Speir, a retired general who formulated the plan and led its execution. Once the deed was done, he wrote a signed confession before committing suicide with his own sword. The Hearthkeepers named him a traitor, but defying their edict, Speir's countrymen buried him with full honours.": "参与刺杀利奥波德皇帝的Unterfolk圣人名叫德米特里-斯皮尔，是一名退役将军，他制定了计划并领导执行。事成之后，他在用自己的剑自杀之前写了一份签名的忏悔书。守炉人称他为叛徒，但斯皮尔的同胞不顾他们的法令，将他满怀荣耀地埋葬。",
	"Of all the provinces, it was Unterland that suffered most after the Gods' End. With the chaos that came from the death of the Four Divines, soldiers were needed more than ever to protect the Empire from both internal and external threats. This led to a diaspora that saw thousands of men leaving to fight wars or keep the peace elsewhere.": "在所有的省份中，Unterland在诸神终结后受到的影响最大。随着四神之死带来的混乱，人们比以往任何时候都更需要士兵来保护帝国免受内部和外部威胁。这就导致了成千上万的人离开，到其他地方打仗或维持和平的散居现象。",
	"First and paramount among the Unters attention was the new nation across the Grey Spine. Under the Empire's orders and with the pretext of disciplining erring citizens, they invaded Ostoya and set up outposts there. Unfortunately, their initial momentum did not last; eventually, Ostoya counter-attacked with armies of the living dead, pushing the Empire back behind the Grey Spine. Knowing that to lose here would mean losing face throughout Etharis, the Bürach did not relent. The years would see a long war of attrition that would weaken both sides.": "在Unters的关注中，最重要的是灰脊梁对面的新国家。在帝国的命令下，他们以惩戒犯错的公民为借口，入侵了奥斯托亚，并在那里设立了前哨站。不幸的是，他们最初的势头并不持久；最终，奥斯托亚用活死人的军队进行了反击，将帝国逼到了灰脊的后面。布拉赫知道在这里失利意味着在整个伊萨利斯丢脸，因此没有松懈。多年来，一场漫长的消耗战将削弱双方的实力。",
	"Today, Unterland's reputation for military power is significant but tarnished, as it is pulled into more and more battles it has no choice but to fight.": "今天，Unterland的军事力量声誉显著，但却受到了损害，因为它被拉入越来越多的战斗中，别无选择。",
	"The Unterfolk are skilled hunters and trackers, capable of living off of the wilds--a necessity given the limited arable land in the province. Their tracking skills have been sought for mercenary work, even by foreign nations.": "安特福克人是熟练的猎人和追踪者，能够在荒野中生存--鉴于该省有限的可耕地，这是必要的。他们的追踪技能已被用于雇佣兵工作，甚至被外国寻求。",
	"Raised by Maligant to be the most powerful of warriors, the Unterfolk have made soldiering their main profession. Such is their ability that even common foot soldiers from Unterland make good combat instructors in other provinces.": "被Maligant培养成最强大的战士，Unterfolk将士兵作为他们的主要职业。他们的能力如此之强，甚至Unterland的普通步兵也能成为其他省份的优秀战斗教官。",
	"{@i {@b Lord General Vassily Roemer}} - The current leader of Unterland, Lord General Roemer is a staunch follower of the imperial government. Selected for his loyalty, military record, and bravery in battle, the wiser of the Unterfolk note that he is not as capable as his predecessors at recognising the threats within his own province—specifically, the Cult of Tormach.": "{@i {@b Lord General Vassily Roemer}}--作为Unterland的现任领导人，Roemer将军是帝国政府的坚定追随者。由于他的忠诚、军事记录和在战斗中的勇敢而被选中，但Unterfolk的聪明人注意到，他不像他的前任那样能够认识到自己省内的威胁，特别是托马斯教派。",
	"Instead, Lord General Roemer's greatest concern is winning the war against the Ostoyans, who have long defied imperial rule, but he is distracted by demands to hunt down and destroy the Beast that has been plaguing the provinces.": "相反，Roemer将军最关心的是赢得对长期反抗帝国统治的Ostoyans的战争，但他被追捕和摧毁困扰各省的野兽的要求所分心。",
	"{@i {@b Speaker Coran Schlei, Leader of the Cult of Tormach}} - In Maligant's absence, a new deity of war, Tormach, has taken on the fallen god's followers. But Tormach is a daemon of wrath and brutal force, a blunt weapon compared to Maligant's keen blade. His perpetual demand for sacrificial bloodshed has kept Unterland at war for years. Speaker Schiel dreams of putting the entire province under his rule, but must bide his time and curry favour with the imperial government first. Many fear he will try to undermine General Roemer's command.": "{@i {@b Speaker Coran Schlei, Leader of the Cult of Tormach}}--在马利根不在的时候，一个新的战争之神托马斯(Tormach)对这位堕落之神的追随者下手了。但托尔马赫是一个充满愤怒和残酷力量的守护神，与马利根的锋利武器相比，他是一个钝器。他对流血牺牲的永久要求使得Unterland多年来一直处于战争状态。Schiel议长梦想着将整个省份置于他的统治之下，但他必须等待时机，先讨好帝国政府。许多人担心他将试图破坏罗默将军的指挥。",
	"{@i {@b Lake Osea}} - According to legend, this body of water first formed on the spot where Aurelia's first disciple struck the ground with her spear to create a spring. The miraculous water gave life to what once was barren land. Today, the sprawling city of Altenheim sits at the edge of this lake.": "{@i {@b Lake Osea}}--据传说，这个水体最初是在奥蕾莉亚的第一个弟子用她的长矛敲击地面以创造出泉水的地方形成的。神奇的水给曾经的不毛之地带来了生命。今天，广阔的阿尔滕海姆市就坐落在这个湖的边缘。",
	"When the goddess Aurelia fell to Earth, most of her body was burned away by her descent. What remained was her head, which fell into Lake Osea.": "当奥蕾莉亚女神坠落到地球时，她的大部分身体都被她的下降过程烧掉了。剩下的是她的头，落入奥西湖。",
	"Today, her gigantic stone face rests at the bottom of the sacred Lake, where it can barely be seen through the murky waters.": "今天，她巨大的石块面孔安放在神圣的湖底，透过浑浊的湖水，几乎看不到它。",
	"According to legend, the water of Lake Osea was once capable of healing diseases and injuries, but no one would attempt to consume it now. The Hearthkeepers have declared it holy ground and have forbidden anyone from approaching the lake itself.": "根据传说，奥西湖的水曾经能够治愈疾病和伤害，但现在没有人会试图饮用它。守炉人宣布这是圣地，并禁止任何人接近湖本身。",
	"{@i {@b Gräffendam}} - Nestled within a plunging valley sits a vast man-made dam. Spanning the breadth of the valley, Gräffendam exists today as one of the most impressive feats of engineering Etharis has ever seen. The majority of the dam appears to be carved from obsidian-black granite, yet how the dam was initially constructed remains a mystery.": "{@i {@b Gräffendam}}--一个巨大的人造大坝坐落在一个急剧下降的山谷中。Gräffendam横跨山谷的宽度，是Etharis所见过的最令人印象深刻的工程杰作之一。大坝的大部分似乎是由黑曜石般的花岗岩雕刻而成，但大坝最初是如何建造的仍然是个谜。",
	"Prior to maintenance undertaken by the current Bürach Empire, it is believed that Gräffendam was built by the Grebenstein dwarves. However, only a select few among the aristocracy know that the dam predates even them.": "在现在的比拉赫帝国进行维护之前，人们认为格雷芬丹是由格雷本斯坦的矮人建造的。然而，只有少数贵族知道，这个大坝甚至比他们还要早。",
	"In addition to the mystery of Gräffendam's origins, there is the mystery of the water contained in its glacial reservoir. Called Aquanos, the water has a variety of useful properties. In its pure state, it remains at a temperature just above freezing, and can only be heated or frozen using magic. When used in place of other water it also greatly increases the yield of farm crops and the potency of potions. These properties have made the aristocrats and landowners of Gräffendam some of the wealthiest in the Empire. The upper classes take their social status literally, residing on the domed roof of the dam.": "除了格雷芬丹的起源之谜外，还有其冰川水库中的水之谜。这种水被称为Aquanos，具有各种有用的特性。在纯粹的状态下，它的温度保持在略高于冰点的水平，只能用魔法加热或冻结。当用来代替其他水时，它还能大大增加农作物的产量和药水的效力。这些特性使格雷芬丹的贵族和地主成为帝国最富有的人之一。上层阶级从字面上理解他们的社会地位，居住在大坝的圆顶上。",
	"Called Gildreath, the aristocracy have constructed a perpetual winter wonderland. Gildreath teems with villas and evergreen gardens draped in magical lights. The privileged few who dwell atop Gräffendam spend their lives indulging in excess and frivolity. The same cannot be said for the desperate masses that live at the base of the dam. The base of Gräffendam is a hive of crime and poverty. When the rumours of plague came, the aristocracy prevented entry to the upper dam by all but the wealthiest. With nowhere else to turn, the growing population of refugees established a vast ghetto of rickety high-rises sloping up the outer wall of the dam. Below these favelas lies the river port of Ünterdam, which has fallen into disrepair since the plague and reduced trade to a near standstill. Due to the limited hours of daylight from the shadow of the dam, the area of Ünterdam and the favela are collectively called \"The Shade\".": "被称为Gildreath的贵族们建造了一个永久的冬季仙境。Gildreath充满了别墅和常青花园，上面挂满了神奇的灯光。居住在格莱芬丹山顶的少数特权阶层一生都在沉溺于过度和轻浮。而居住在大坝底部的绝望的群众则不能这样说。格雷芬丹的底部是一个犯罪和贫困的巢穴。当瘟疫的谣言传来时，贵族们阻止了除最富有的人之外的所有人进入大坝上部。由于无处可去，越来越多的难民建立了一个巨大的贫民窟，由摇摇欲坠的高楼大厦组成，沿着大坝的外墙向上倾斜。在这些贫民区的下面是鹿特丹的河港，自从瘟疫发生后，该港口已经年久失修，贸易几乎停滞不前。由于大坝的阴影导致日照时间有限，于特丹地区和贫民窟被统称为 \"阴凉处\"。",
	"Shortly after Gräffendam was closed to the public, the upper class struck a deal with the Ebon Syndicate. The Syndicate would get a cut of the shipping revenue and control over The Shade, so long as they prevented intruders breaching the dam walls and quashed civil unrest. With unchecked authority over the base of the dam, the Syndicate are free to conduct whatever business they wish.": "Gräffendam对公众关闭后不久，上层社会与Ebon集团达成了一项协议。只要防止入侵者冲破大坝的围墙，并平息民间动乱，辛迪加就可以得到航运收入的分成和对 \"阴凉地 \"的控制。由于对大坝基地拥有不受约束的权力，辛迪加可以自由地进行他们想做的任何事情。",
	"{@i {@b Mt. Vengeance}} - The only active volcano in the Bürach Empire, Mt. Vengeance was thought to have been extinct for centuries before the Gods' End. The energies caused by the war between the gods seem to have ignited its fires once more.": "{@i {@b Mt. Vengeance}}--复仇山是比拉赫帝国唯一的一座活火山，在诸神末日之前，人们认为它已经灭绝了几个世纪。诸神之间的战争引起的能量似乎再次点燃了它的火焰。",
	"That said, something else seems to be happening deep in the bowels of the volcano. Powerful magical energies ripple from the crater, and some scholars of magic speculate that this is due to the presence of an imperial artifact.": "也就是说，在火山深处似乎还发生了别的事情。强大的魔法能量从火山口荡漾开来，一些魔法学者推测这是因为有一件帝国的神器存在。",
	"Since these rumours started, many adventurers have tried to investigate the volcano. The few that returned bore horrific burn wounds and tales of creatures made of flame and shadow. As for the artifact, if it is there, none have seen it yet.": "自从这些传言开始，许多冒险家都试图调查这座火山。少数回来的人带着可怕的烧伤和关于火焰和阴影生物的故事。至于那件神器，如果它真的存在，还没有人看到它。",
	"{@i {@b Castle Martorius}} - Decades after the Gods' End, an enormous palace of shining, opalescent towers and silken banners appeared atop a mountain overlooking Abendland.": "{@i {@b Castle Martorius}}--在诸神终结的几十年后，一座由闪亮的乳白色塔楼和丝质旗帜组成的巨大宫殿出现在一座俯瞰阿本德兰的山顶上。",
	"The castle's owner is the archmage Martorius. He claimed that he had lived on this land before the Bürach Empire even existed, but had spent the intervening years traveling between dimensions in pursuit of his magical research. Now, he assured the Unterfolk, he had no interest but to observe developments in the Empire as they unfold.": "这座城堡的主人是大法师马托里斯。他声称，在比拉赫帝国存在之前，他就住在这片土地上，但在这期间，他为了追求他的魔法研究，一直在各维度之间旅行。现在，他向Unterfolk保证，他除了观察帝国的发展，没有任何兴趣。",
	"Indeed, the archmage's castle is a wonder to behold. Dignitaries that have visited it report that there is no way to determine its true dimensions, as it expands and adds rooms to itself as necessary. Aerial servants cater to the guests, and a wide variety of illusionary people and animals wander through the halls as if they had a life of their own.": "的确，大法师的城堡是一个奇迹。参观过它的贵族们报告说，没有办法确定它的真实尺寸，因为它在必要时还会扩展和增加房间。空中的仆人为客人提供服务，各种各样的幻象人和动物在大厅里徘徊，仿佛他们有自己的生命。",
	"Given Martorius' stature, the imperial government decided to accommodate him. In return, Martorius offered his counsel and even aided the Hearthkeepers in keeping the peace among the provinces. Yet for all this, no one in the imperial court believes Martorius is truly benevolent. The Hearthkeepers know his servants have been making inquiries throughout the provinces, searching high and low for the emperor's artifacts.": "鉴于Martorius的地位，帝国政府决定接纳他。作为回报，Martorius提供了他的建议，甚至帮助守炉人维持各省之间的和平。然而，对于这一切，朝廷中没有人相信Martorius是真正的仁慈的。守炉人知道他的仆人一直在各省打听，到处寻找皇帝的神器。",
	"They have sent spies to infiltrate his palace, but none have returned. What Martorius is really after remains to be seen.": "他们已经派出间谍潜入他的宫殿，但没有人回来。马托里斯的真正目的是什么，还有待观察。",
	"Beyond the Grey Spine Peaks lies a land shrouded in mist and shadow. The hearts of the Ostoyan people are as cold and forbidding as the land they dwell in. Here the mages of the Ravencourt Sanctuary spin their nebulous plots, the Vampire Lords of the Crimson Court devise plans to engulf Etharis in a tide of undead, and the hidden denizens of the City Below wait in the dark, hungry for the living.": "在灰刺峰之外，有一片被迷雾和阴影笼罩的土地。奥斯托扬人的心就像他们居住的土地一样冰冷和禁忌。在这里，拉文考特圣地的法师们编织着他们虚无缥缈的阴谋，深红法庭的吸血鬼领主们制定着将伊萨里斯吞噬在亡灵大潮中的计划，而下面城市的隐秘居民则在黑暗中等待着，渴望着活人。",
	"The lands east of the Grey Spine are a temperate, heavily-forested region filled with hills and valleys. The further one travels east, the more the land flattens into rolling plains, dotted here and there by treacherous heaths and bogs. At the easternmost edge of Ostoya, the terrain breaks into jagged cliffs that border a restless, ice-filled sea. Further eastward across the water, a magical fog surrounds an island that few have ever laid eyes on.": "灰脊梁以东的土地是一个温带的、森林覆盖率高的地区，到处是山丘和山谷。越往东走，土地就越平坦，变成了连绵不断的平原，这里和那里都点缀着险峻的石楠和沼泽。在奥斯托亚的最东边，地形断裂成锯齿状的悬崖，与不稳定的、充满冰雪的大海为邻。再向东穿过水面，神奇的雾气围绕着一个很少有人注意到的岛屿。",
	"The terrain is not suited for heavy farming. The Ostoyans supplement what meagre crops they grow by hunting and herding. Coastal cities also employ fishing and whaling fleets to feed their burgeoning populations. The Ostoyan weather is typified by Nov Ostoya's skies, heavy rains, sudden snowfall, and endless mists. The sun is a rare sight, and most welcome when it breaks through the mantle of grey clouds.": "这里的地形不适合繁重的耕作。奥斯托亚人通过打猎和放牧来补充他们所种植的微薄作物。沿海城市也雇用捕鱼和捕鲸船队来养活他们不断增长的人口。奥斯托亚的天气以新奥斯托亚的天空、大雨、突然降雪和无尽的薄雾为典型特征。太阳是一种罕见的景象，当它冲破灰色的云层时最受欢迎。",
	"What Ostoya lacks in hospitable environment, it makes up in tremendous amounts of ore, stone, and coal from the Grey Spine. Lumber is also plentiful, enabling the Ostoyans to build robust structures. These resources lend themselves to frequent trade with other nations, but also lead to violent border disputes with neighbours, particularly the Bürach.": "奥斯托亚缺乏好客的环境，但它弥补了来自灰刺的大量矿石、石头和煤炭。木材也很丰富，使奥斯托亚人能够建造坚固的建筑。这些资源使其能够与其他国家进行频繁的贸易，但也导致了与邻国，特别是与布拉克人的激烈的边界争端。",
	"Ostoya was founded centuries ago by Bürach secessionists—migrants who fled the fledgling Bürach Empire's tumultuous early days to find a more peaceful country. A nobleman named Elias Beralt led his family and followers through the treacherous passes of the Grey Spine, emerging on the other side to find a country lush with pine woods and rolling hills. He named it Ostoya, which in the ancient tongue means \"Our Own.\"": "奥斯托亚是几个世纪前由比拉赫的分离主义者建立的--这些移民逃离了新生的比拉赫帝国动荡的早期，去寻找一个更和平的国家。一位名叫埃利亚斯-贝拉尔特的贵族带领他的家人和追随者穿过灰刺的险峻通道，在另一边发现了一个松树林和连绵起伏的国家。他将其命名为Ostoya，在古语中意为 \"我们自己的\"。",
	"Over the years, a loose confederation formed among the communities trying to carve a living out of the wild lands. The most successful of these became the provinces of Soma to the south and Raevo to the north. Other settlements of note include Malkovia, Fallowheart, Riven, and Voyd.": "多年来，试图在荒芜的土地上谋生的社区之间形成了一个松散的联盟。其中最成功的是南部的索玛省和北部的雷沃省。其他值得注意的定居点包括马尔科维亚、法洛心、瑞文和沃伊德。",
	"The Ostoyans worked hard to tame the land, clearing forests for livestock and lumber. With the discovery of coal and precious minerals in the foothills of the Grey Spine, mining towns soon opened, followed by roads and byways. Further to the east, explorers discovered a break in the seaside cliffs that led to a natural harbour. Here they founded the coastal city of Nov Ostoya, which became the seat of the Ostoyan Aristocracy.": "奥斯托亚人努力驯服土地，为牲畜和木材开垦森林。随着在灰脊梁山麓发现了煤炭和珍贵的矿物，采矿镇很快就开张了，接着就是公路和道路。再往东走，探险家们发现了海边悬崖上的一个断口，通往一个天然港口。他们在这里建立了沿海城市新奥斯托亚，成为奥斯托亚贵族的所在地。",
	"While Ostoya was not known to have large populations of natural predators such as wolves and bears, every now and then people were known to disappear for good, often with signs of a struggle.": "虽然奥斯托亚不知道有大量的自然捕食者，如狼和熊，但每隔一段时间，人们就会永远消失，往往有挣扎的痕迹。",
	"After spending two hundred years taming its borders, the Bürach Empire turned its attention towards expansion. Since the Ostoyans were descended from the Bürach, the Empire deemed them its citizens, ordering them to pay taxes and turn over control of their mines. When the Ostoyans refused, the Bürach attacked.": "在花了两百年时间驯服其边界之后，布拉克帝国将注意力转向了扩张。由于奥斯托亚人是比拉赫人的后裔，帝国认为他们是自己的公民，命令他们缴税并交出矿场的控制权。当奥斯托亚人拒绝时，布拉克人发动了攻击。",
	"The Ostoyans hastily forged their arms and mustered their men. The wealth drawn from their mines allowed them to bolster their army with mercenaries such as the Free Swords. Despite this, the Ostoyans were not adept at war, having lived too many years in peace. Were it not for the natural borders of their forests and the Grey Spine, Ostoya would have been overrun long ago. Still, the Bürach gained a firm foothold in the region.": "奥斯托亚人匆匆忙忙地锻造武器，召集人员。从矿区获得的财富使他们能够用自由之剑这样的雇佣兵来加强他们的军队。尽管如此，奥斯托亚人并不擅长战争，他们已经在和平中生活了太多年。如果不是因为他们的森林和灰刺的自然边界，奥斯托亚早就被征服了。尽管如此，布拉克人还是在该地区站稳了脚跟。",
	"Two decades into the Ostoya-Bürach war, a terrible earthquake shook the Soma region. Something sinister underneath the ground was making itself known. The skies darkened over Ostoya as necrotic energy poured out of cracks in the earth.": "奥斯托亚-布拉克战争二十年后，一场可怕的地震震动了索玛地区。地底的邪恶之物正在显露出来。奥斯托亚的天空变暗了，因为坏死的能量从大地的裂缝中涌出。",
	"To the shock of the local populace, the fissures that opened revealed long-buried ruins. The city of Nov Ostoya had apparently been built over the bones of an ancient metropolis that had sunk beneath the earth ages ago.": "令当地居民震惊的是，打开的裂缝露出了埋藏已久的废墟。新奥斯托亚市显然是在一个古老的大都市的骨头上建立起来的，这个大都市在很久以前就沉入了地底。",
	"The Soman nobility sent expeditions to investigate these underground structures in the hopes of uncovering treasure or magical secrets that would help the war effort. Most of these groups did not return; the few that did had been reduced to stragglers, babbling hysterical tales of maze-like ruins, ravenous undead, and a dark shrine that spoke to their minds.": "苏曼的贵族们派出探险队去调查这些地下建筑，希望能发现有助于战争的宝藏或魔法秘密。这些队伍中的大多数人都没有回来；少数回来的人已经沦为散兵游勇，喋喋不休地讲述着迷宫般的废墟、贪婪的亡灵和一个与他们心灵对话的黑暗神殿。",
	"Eventually, the missing explorers returned, though as many would soon find out, they had been changed forever. They marched with an undead horde that rose in full force into Soma. The desperate Ostoyans then found themselves caught in a war on two fronts.": "最终，失踪的探险家们回来了，尽管许多人很快就会发现，他们已经被永远改变了。他们与一个亡灵部落一起行进，并在索玛全面崛起。绝望的奥斯托亚人随后发现自己陷入了一场两线作战。",
	"Stretched to breaking, the Ostoyans fell to drastic measures. A specialised company of soldiers descended into the abyss and held off the horde. Then, mages from Raevo collapsed the largest of the fissures, sealing the undead back underground. With that, the Ostoyans hoped to turn their efforts back to repelling the Bürach.": "奥斯托亚人被逼得走投无路，只好采取激烈的措施。一支专门的士兵队伍下到深渊，挡住了部落的进攻。然后，来自雷沃的法师塌下了最大的裂缝，将亡灵封在地下。就这样，奥斯托亚人希望将他们的努力转回到击退布拉克人上。",
	"But the undead, it seemed, were not finished. One year later, a strange malady began to spread among the nobility. They died only to rise again—as vampires.": "但是，亡灵们似乎还没有结束。一年后，一种奇怪的弊病开始在贵族中蔓延。他们死了，却又以吸血鬼的身份复活了。",
	"The undead quickly overran the government and suppressed all opposition. Then they moved against Bürach. In the winter of the war's 25th year, the Bürach abandoned their forts in Ostoyan territory and retreated to their homeland.": "亡灵们迅速占领了政府，并镇压了所有反对派。然后，他们对布拉克采取行动。在战争第25年的冬天，比拉赫人放弃了他们在奥斯托扬领土上的堡垒，退到了自己的家乡。",
	"To this day, Ostoya and Bürach remain at war, but now as rivals of equal strength. For every step one side takes into the other's territory, they are driven back. The two great powers stand at a deadlock.": "时至今日，奥斯托亚和比拉赫仍然处于战争状态，但现在是实力相当的对手。一方每进入另一方的领土一步，都会被赶回来。这两个大国陷入了僵局。",
	"Even now the supernatural darkening of Ostoya's sky persists. The youngest generation of the city of Nov Ostoya have never seen the sun. A perpetual night covers the whole land, only weakening to a dismal twilight near Ostoya's borders. Indeed, the people of the neighboring Charneault Kingdom consider Ostoya to begin where the light ends-though some fear that the border is encroaching year by year.": "即使是现在，奥斯托亚天空的超自然暗淡现象依然存在。新奥斯托亚市最年轻的一代从未见过太阳。永恒的黑夜笼罩着整个大地，只有在奥斯托亚的边界附近才会减弱为一个凄凉的黄昏。事实上，邻近的查诺特王国的人民认为奥斯托亚是光明的终点--尽管有些人担心边界正在逐年被侵占。",
	"The knowledge that vampires had taken over the nobility created a deep schism among the Ostoyan populace. Despite efforts to suppress them, the entire province of Raevo seceded from the Aristocracy.": "吸血鬼占领了贵族的知识在奥斯托扬的民众中造成了深刻的分裂。尽管努力压制他们，整个雷沃省还是脱离了贵族阶层。",
	"The Ostoyans began an unusual civil war. While Raevo and Soma exchange violent skirmishes, the two sides still have a symbiotic relationship-for while Somans and Raevans hated each other, they hated the Bürach even more. Both sides took care not to annihilate a potential ally in the event the Empire should attempt a second invasion.": "奥斯托扬人开始了一场不寻常的内战。虽然雷沃和索玛交换了激烈的小规模冲突，但双方仍有一种共生的关系--虽然索玛人和雷沃人互相憎恨，但他们更憎恨布拉赫人。双方都小心翼翼地避免在帝国试图第二次入侵时歼灭一个潜在的盟友。",
	"Ostoyans are a hardy folk, having long accepted the likelihood of a short life thanks to the ever-present threats of war, sickness, the cold, and the roaming undead. They value the simple life-a hot meal at the end of a long day's work and a mug of mead is reward enough for the lower classes.": "奥斯托亚人是一个坚韧的民族，由于战争、疾病、寒冷和游荡的亡灵的威胁无处不在，他们早已接受了短命的可能性。他们重视简单的生活--在漫长的一天工作结束后吃上一顿热饭，喝上一杯蜂蜜酒，对下层阶级来说已经是足够的奖励。",
	"Most Ostoyans are clannish, putting familial honour and bonds above life itself. The people suffered much under the Bürach Empire, now many of them consider the Soman nobility heroes for driving out the invaders. They follow the nobility without question, with only the secessionist Raevans as an exception.": "大多数奥斯托亚人都是宗族式的，把家族的荣誉和纽带放在生命本身之上。人们在比拉赫帝国时期遭受了很多苦难，现在他们中的许多人认为索曼贵族是赶走入侵者的英雄。他们毫无疑义地追随贵族，只有分离主义的雷凡人是个例外。",
	"A plethora of Seraphs have retained a foothold across the Etharis, but in truth, Ostoyans have faith in only one idol: Solyma, the Lady of Vengeance. Revenge is the only true religion in Ostoya. No Ostoyan believes in turning the other cheek. Indeed, forswearing vengeance is considered a weakness of character, bringing shame and a loss of face before society. An overly forgiving Ostoyan would surely be driven out of town by their own family.": "众多的塞拉弗在整个伊萨里斯保留了一个立足点，但事实上，奥斯托亚人只信仰一个偶像。索里玛，复仇女神。复仇是奥斯托亚唯一真正的宗教。没有一个奥斯托亚人相信要转过脸去。事实上，放弃复仇被认为是性格上的弱点，会给社会带来耻辱和损失。一个过分宽容的奥斯托亚人肯定会被自己的家人赶出小镇。",
	"Visitors from other lands would do well to acquaint themselves with local customs, and to keep wandering eyes and hands far from the peasants' daughters, lest they make an enemy for life. Even the vampiric nobility, who hold absolute sway over the lives of the peasants, take pains not to make their cruelty personal. For once wronged, Ostoyans pursue retribution single-mindedly.": "来自其他国家的游客最好熟悉当地的风俗习惯，并让游荡的眼睛和手远离农民的女儿，以免他们成为终身的敌人。即使是对农民的生活拥有绝对支配权的吸血鬼贵族，也会努力避免使他们的残忍成为个人行为。因为一旦受了委屈，奥斯托亚人就会一心一意地追求报应。",
	"Folk tales and sagas abound of entire families wiped out by disputes over land and grazing rights. To this day, long-standing family feuds occasionally require intercession from the nobles themselves, to prevent further loss of warm bodies.": "关于因土地和放牧权纠纷而导致整个家庭灭亡的民间故事和传奇故事比比皆是。时至今日，长期存在的家族争斗偶尔需要贵族们自己出面调解，以防止进一步失去温暖的身体。",
	"The province of Soma is the seat of the Ostoyan government, or so the Somans like to believe. Here lies the capital city, Nov Ostoya, and its central keep, Blackharbour.": "索玛省是奥斯托亚政府的所在地，或者说索玛人喜欢这样认为。这里有首都新奥斯托亚，以及它的中央堡垒黑港。",
	"When the first immigrants arrived in Ostoya, they immediately staked out certain areas for their own. The Volker family chose a place where the jagged seaside cliffs gave way to a beach and a natural harbour. It was a windblown area with strange red earth which they assumed to be clay. They founded the town of Nov Ostoya and raised a keep by the restless sea.": "当第一批移民到达奥斯托亚时，他们立即为自己划定了某些区域。沃尔克家族选择了一个地方，那里有参差不齐的海边悬崖，为海滩和天然港口让路。这是一个被风吹过的地方，有奇怪的红土，他们认为是粘土。他们建立了新奥斯托亚镇，并在不平静的海面上建立了一座堡垒。",
	"In time, Nov Ostoya became a hub for sea trading, fishing, and whaling. Lumberyards were erected at the nearby forests. As the roads lengthened and grew more developed, wealth began to flow into the town, which soon turned into a dense city filled with ornate towers and brooding sculptures. Nov Ostoya came to be known as the City of Gargoyles.": "随着时间的推移，新奥斯托亚成为海上贸易、捕鱼和捕鲸的中心。附近的森林里建起了伐木场。随着道路的延长和发展，财富开始流入该镇，很快就变成了一个密集的城市，到处都是华丽的塔楼和忧郁的雕塑。新奥斯托亚被称为 \"巨妖之城\"。",
	"When the Bürach Empire invaded Ostoya, Soma was at the front lines of the war. While wealthy, their army was not as experienced as the Empire's seasoned soldiers, and they lost more battles than they won. The Bürach's encroachment into the province grew with each passing season, before retreating for the winter.": "当布拉赫帝国入侵奥斯托亚时，索玛处于战争的前线。虽然富裕，但他们的军队没有帝国经验丰富的士兵，他们输的战役比赢的多。比拉赫人对该省的侵占随着季节的推移而增加，然后在冬季撤退。",
	"Matters worsened when the Darkfall led to widespread destruction. The inciting earthquake unearthed an ancient metropolis that the Somans had unwittingly built over. The City Below gave up its dead: hordes of zombies, wights, ghouls, and vampires emerged from the abyss to ravage the countryside.": "当黑暗降临导致大范围的破坏时，事情变得更糟了。诱发地震的是一个古老的大都市，索马里人在不知不觉中把它建在了上面。下面的城市放弃了它的死者：成群结队的僵尸、巫师、食尸鬼和吸血鬼从深渊中涌现出来，蹂躏着乡村地区。",
	"Without drastic measures, it was clear that Ostoya would fall to this new threat. The nobility came up with a plan: they ordered a young Soman captain named Morgen Hund and his company to fight their way into the largest chasm and hold back the tide of undead.": "如果不采取严厉的措施，很明显，奥斯托亚会在这个新的威胁面前倒下。贵族们想出了一个计划：他们命令一个名叫摩根-亨德（Morgen Hund）的年轻索曼人队长和他的连队一路打进最大的鸿沟，挡住亡灵的潮水。",
	"Hund's company dutifully descended the crevice, destroying scores of undead along the way. When they had carried the battle deep into the abyss, the Raevo wizards used their most powerful spells to collapse the sides of the crevice, sealing both the undead and the soldiers within.": "亨德的连队尽职尽责地走下裂缝，一路上消灭了几十个亡灵。当他们把战斗带入深渊时，雷沃的巫师们用他们最强大的法术使裂缝的两侧坍塌，把亡灵和士兵们都封在里面。",
	"With the horde dealt with, the nobility took one day to honour their soldiers' sacrifice before turning their attention back to the Bürach.": "解决了部落问题后，贵族们用一天时间来纪念他们的士兵的牺牲，然后再把注意力转移到布拉克身上。",
	"But this was not the last they saw of Morgen Hund.": "但这并不是他们最后一次看到莫尔根-洪德。",
	"The Ostoyan captain had survived the collapse. He wandered deep in the underground city to escape the undead horde. During his travels, he found himself in a strange shrine dedicated to a forgotten god. The shrine spoke to him, offering him his fondest desire in exchange for his servitude. Hund replied, \"I wish for the power to destroy my oppressors.\"": "奥斯托亚队长在坍塌中幸存下来。他在地下城市的深处徘徊，以逃避亡灵部落。在他的旅行中，他发现自己在一个奇怪的神龛里，供奉着一个被遗忘的神。神殿对他说话，用他最美好的愿望来换取他的奴役。亨德回答说：\"我希望有能力摧毁我的压迫者。\"",
	"The shrine glowed in the dark like a votive candle, then struck Hund down with a blast of sinister magic. \"Granted.\"": "神龛在黑暗中发着光，就像一个选民的蜡烛，然后用一阵阴险的魔法将亨德击倒。\"批准了。\"",
	"When he awoke days later, Hund had been changed into a vampire lord. He spent the better part of the year gathering an army of undead before returning to the surface.": "当他几天后醒来时，亨德已经变成了一个吸血鬼领主。在返回地面之前，他花了一年多的时间收集了一支亡灵军队。",
	"Upon emerging Hund sought the Soman nobility, turning each one into vampires. He killed the Grand Duke and took his place, renaming himself Klaus Vorgen, Lord of Soma.": "一出现，洪德就寻找索曼贵族，把每个人都变成吸血鬼。他杀死了大公，并取代了他的位置，改名为克劳斯-沃根，索玛之主。",
	"Once the gentry and nobility were all turned, they formed a united front against the Bürach. Bürach soldiers were shocked to see their dead comrades rising from the frozen battlefield and shambling towards them. After a single bitter season of war, the undead forced the Bürach to abandon their forts in Soma and return to their homeland.": "一旦乡绅和贵族们都转向，他们就形成了反对布拉克的统一战线。布拉克的士兵们震惊地看到他们死去的战友从冰冷的战场上站起来，摇摇晃晃地走向他们。经过一个痛苦的战争季节，亡灵迫使布拉克人放弃了他们在索玛的堡垒，回到了他们的家乡。",
	"After this victory, Grand Duke Vorgen continued to consolidate his power. He established the Crimson Court, the highest ruling body of Ostoya, and placed his closest allies in the highest circle of power. They ruled the land unchallenged for years until the Raevan Secession.": "这次胜利后，沃根大公继续巩固他的权力。他建立了奥斯托亚的最高统治机构--深红法庭，并将他最亲密的盟友置于最高权力圈。他们多年来一直统治着这片土地，没有受到任何挑战，直到雷凡分裂。",
	"To date, some small fissures to the City Below remain open, and none really know what passes through. Come nightfall, the citizens lock themselves in their homes and taverns and wait for dawn. All travellers are warned: above all, do not wander Soma at night.": "迄今为止，通往下面城市的一些小裂缝仍然敞开着，没有人真正知道什么东西会通过。夜幕降临时，市民们把自己关在家里和酒馆里，等待黎明的到来。所有的旅行者都被警告：首先，不要在夜间徘徊索玛。",
	"Soma's is a closed aristocracy, and most of its citizens live in grinding poverty.": "索玛的是一个封闭的贵族阶层，大多数公民生活在极度贫困之中。",
	"The Crimson Court rules every aspect of Soma. Even the local branch of the criminal Ebon Syndicate does not operate without the Court's tacit approval, and take great care not to bite the hand that feeds.": "深红法庭统治着索玛的方方面面。即使是犯罪集团Ebon Syndicate的当地分支，如果没有法院的默许也不会运作，并且非常小心地避免咬住喂养他们的手。",
	"The Crimson Court is composed of the seven leading nobles of Soma. While they are allies, no true loyalty exists among the vampiric ruling class. Each noble vies to sit at the head of the table, employing schemes that can take decades to bear fruit.": "深红法庭由索玛的七个主要贵族组成。虽然他们是盟友，但在吸血鬼的统治阶级中并不存在真正的忠诚。每个贵族都争先恐后地坐在桌子的首位，采用的计划可能需要几十年才能产生结果。",
	"Currently, the Court is ruled by Grand Duke Drago Koshevek.": "目前，法院由大公德拉戈-科舍韦克统治。",
	"Soma is a feudal society. The vampire nobility who hold Soma's wealth have divided control of the mines, the lumber, the craftsmen, and the fisheries amongst themselves. Meanwhile the human peasantry makes their living as best they can by fishing, mining, or farming. Trade typically flows through shipping lanes to distant lands, though of late there has been trouble with Bürach naval blockades.": "索玛是一个封建社会。掌握索玛财富的吸血鬼贵族将矿场、木材、工匠和渔业的控制权分给他们自己。同时，人类农民以捕鱼、采矿或耕作为生，尽其所能。贸易通常通过航道流向遥远的地方，尽管最近布拉克的海军封锁带来了麻烦。",
	"Grand Duke Drago Koshevek - Grand Duke Drago is a harsh, humourless, and often cruel Vampire Lord, even by the standards of the Soman vampire nobility. Five years ago he seized control of the court by deposing the previous Duke Olkov, whom he had painted as more of a bureaucrat than a nobleman.": "德拉戈-科舍维克大公--德拉戈大公是一个严酷的、没有幽默感的、经常是残酷的吸血鬼领主，即使以索曼的吸血鬼贵族的标准来看也是如此。五年前，他通过罢免前任公爵奥尔科夫夺取了宫廷的控制权，他把奥尔科夫描绘成一个官僚而不是一个贵族。",
	"A soldier by nature, he dreams of launching a grand campaign against the Bürach to finally end the Empire's enduring threat against his land. To that end, he has been amassing wealth to fund a massive army. His obsession with defeating Bürach has made him unpopular with the Crimson Court, though each noble is careful to keep their opinion to themselves.": "他天生就是一名军人，他梦想着发动一场针对比拉赫人的盛大战役，最终结束帝国对他的土地的持久威胁。为此，他一直在积累财富以资助一支庞大的军队。他对击败比拉赫的痴迷使他在深红宫廷中不受欢迎，尽管每个贵族都小心翼翼地保留自己的意见。",
	"Countess Katalina Vulpescu - Shrewd, confident, and flamboyant, the Countess is the exact opposite of the Grand Duke. She is an infamous member among the Crimson Court, known for hosting lavish and debauched parties at her estate. Any newcomer to the land is almost certain to be invited. These balls serve a purpose: they allow Vulpescu to spy on newcomers, gather information, make new allies, and dispose of would-be enemies. Anyone who meets Countess Vulpescu will remember her affable, charming personality, her sharp sword, and even sharper tongue.": "卡塔琳娜-瓦尔佩斯库伯爵夫人--精明、自信、张扬，伯爵夫人与大公爵完全相反。她是深红宫廷中臭名昭著的成员，以在她的庄园里举办奢华放荡的派对而闻名。任何新来的人都几乎肯定会被邀请。这些舞会有一个目的：它们允许弗斯库尔普监视新来者，收集信息，结交新的盟友，并处置可能的敌人。任何见到韦斯库尔普伯爵夫人的人都会记住她和蔼可亲的迷人个性、她的锋利的剑和更加尖锐的舌头。",
	"Despite her lavish spending and appetites, the Countess is a consummate businesswoman who runs trade and crafts in Soma. She has earned Grand Duke Koshevek's grudging respect by funding his efforts to raise an army. Unbeknownst to the Grand Duke, however, the Countess has been undermining his campaign from the beginning, sometimes leaking information to their enemies in order to sabotage his endeavours.": "尽管伯爵夫人花钱大手大脚，胃口大开，但她是一个完美的商人，在索玛经营贸易和工艺品。她通过资助Koshevek大公组建军队的努力，赢得了他勉强的尊重。然而，大公不知道的是，伯爵夫人从一开始就在破坏他的运动，有时向他们的敌人泄露信息，以破坏他的努力。",
	"The Chiropteran Behemoth - The Grand Duke's secret weapon, this bat-like humanoid monstrosity is the size of an adult dragon. During the day, it sleeps in the dome of the desecrated Vonsantra Cathedral. It possesses a limited intelligence and a fanatical loyalty to its creator, Koshevek—when called for, it will fly unerringly to Koshevek's location. It is capable of unleashing an ear-splitting scream that can paralyse victims and can create a sphere of darkness to blind them. Even without these powers, its mighty jaws and sharp claws are a match for many a foe.": "翼手党巨兽--大公爵的秘密武器，这个类似蝙蝠的人形怪兽有成年龙那么大。白天，它睡在被亵渎的冯桑特拉大教堂的穹顶上。它拥有有限的智力和对其创造者科舍维克的狂热忠诚--当被召唤时，它会准确无误地飞向科舍维克的位置。它能发出刺耳的尖叫声，使受害者瘫痪，并能创造一个黑暗的球体使他们失明。即使没有这些能力，它强大的下颚和锋利的爪子也是许多敌人的对手。",
	"And so he waited for seven figures to fill those seven seats. And waited.": "于是他等待着七个数字来填补这七个席位。并等待着。",
	"Far to the north lies Soma's rival for control of all of Ostoya. Raevo is a province ruled by wizards, a magocracy that fights to abolish the Soman nobility and find a way to end the undead supremacy.": "远在北方的索玛是控制整个奥斯托亚的对手。雷沃是一个由巫师统治的省份，一个为废除索曼贵族并找到结束不死族统治的方法而斗争的魔法政权。",
	"A delicate balance of power exists between the two provinces. While the Raevans are technically at war with the Somans, they are sometimes forced to work together to repel the Bürach Empire. Thus, both are incapable of destroying the other while their common enemy exists.": "两个省之间存在着一种微妙的权力平衡。虽然雷凡人在技术上与索曼人处于战争状态，但他们有时也被迫合作，以击退布拉克帝国。因此，在他们共同的敌人存在时，双方都没有能力消灭对方。",
	"Raevans built their city of Castalore with incredible foresight—they knew that they would one day be besieged, whether by an invading Bürach force or by their own countrymen, so they built their city as a fortress from its inception. Castalore sits atop a cliff and is shaped like a snake coiling upwards. High stone walls and a ten-ton steel portcullis protect the lower city. The higher one goes up the spiral, the more affluent the neighbourhood; at the very top sits Nightingale Tower, the magocracy's seat of power.": "雷文斯人以惊人的远见建造了他们的卡斯塔洛城--他们知道有一天他们会被围困，不管是被入侵的比拉赫部队还是被他们自己的同胞围困，所以他们从一开始就把自己的城市建设成了一个堡垒。卡斯塔洛尔位于悬崖之上，形状像一条盘旋向上的蛇。高大的石墙和一个十吨重的钢制舷梯保护着低层城市。沿着螺旋线越往上走，附近就越富裕；最顶层是夜莺塔，是魔法师们的权力所在地。",
	"Raevo openly supports the Order of Dawn in their bid to fight the Crimson Court. Whether this support is entirely benevolent or merely pragmatic remains to be seen.": "雷沃公开支持黎明骑士团对抗深红法庭。这种支持是完全仁慈的还是仅仅是务实的，还有待观察。",
	"Raevo was founded by a young diviner, Lissandra, who dreamt she would one day raise a force that could defend Ostoya from those who would despoil it.": "雷沃是由一位年轻的占卜师利桑德拉建立的，她梦想有一天她会组建一支部队，可以保护奥斯托亚不被那些人掠夺。",
	"She followed her visions from her hometown of Voyd to the high cliffs to the north. Here she raised the settlement known as Castalore with her family, which grew into a fortified whaling town.": "她跟随她的幻觉从她的家乡沃伊德来到北方的高崖上。在这里，她和她的家人一起建立了名为卡斯塔洛的定居点，并发展成为一个坚固的捕鲸镇。",
	"Though the town thrived, Lissandra herself grew withdrawn, spending her time looking into the mists across the sea. Eventually, she took a rowboat and vanished into the east.": "虽然这个镇子很繁荣，但利桑德拉自己却越来越孤僻，她把时间花在看海对面的迷雾上。最后，她坐上了一艘划艇，消失在东方。",
	"Several years later, the townsfolk were surprised to see a lone, unmanned rowboat emerge from the mists and dock at the pier. In the boat was a wax-sealed envelope containing a note, which said that all who had the talent for magic should travel to the Ravencourt Sanctuary, if they wished to learn the craft. Most of the townsfolk thought it was just a hoax, but ten young men and women boarded the boat against their elders' wishes. The boat bore them away into the mist.": "几年后，镇民们惊讶地看到一艘无人驾驶的孤船从迷雾中出现，停靠在码头。船上有一个蜡封的信封，里面有一张纸条，上面说所有有魔法天赋的人都应该去拉文考特圣地，如果他们想学习这种技艺的话。大多数镇民认为这只是一个骗局，但有十个年轻男女不顾他们长辈的意愿上了船。船载着他们驶入了迷雾之中。",
	"When they returned seven years later, they came home as wizards. But not all of them returned - one was missing, and the mages could not be made to tell what happened to their lost member.": "七年后，当他们回来时，他们作为法师回家了。但并不是所有的人都回来了--有一个人失踪了，无法让法师们说出他们失去的成员发生了什么。",
	"The wizards improved the conditions of the town and eventually turned it into a city. They established themselves as leaders of the republic and fostered its economy. Every seven years, another boat would come from the mists bearing the same invitation. Those who had potential would go into the mists and return as mages—but always, the Sanctuary kept one student as its due.": "巫师们改善了该镇的条件，并最终将其变成了一座城市。他们确立了自己作为共和国领导人的地位，并促进了经济的发展。每隔七年，就会有另一艘船从迷雾中来，带着同样的邀请。那些有潜力的人将进入迷雾并作为法师返回，但圣域总是保留一个学生作为其应得的。",
	"When news spread that the Soman nobility had become vampires, not all citizens fell in with the new regime. The few who rebelled took advantage of the aristocracy's war with the Bürach and settled in the northern province of Raevo. There they established ties with the existing government, forming a republic. By the time the Crimson Court could turn their full attention to the dissidents, Raevo was ready for them.": "当索曼贵族成为吸血鬼的消息传开后，并不是所有的公民都支持新政权。少数反叛的人利用贵族与布拉克人的战争，在北部的雷沃省定居。他们在那里与现有政府建立了联系，形成了一个共和国。当深红宫廷可以把他们的注意力完全转向持不同政见者的时候，雷沃已经为他们做好了准备。",
	"In the Ostoyan civil war, Soma possesses the larger army, composed of battle-hardened veterans from the war against Bürach and supplemented with strike teams of undead. On the other hand, Raevo has its wizards. Their magic enables them to match the greater numbers of the Somans and beguile soldiers into fighting each other. To deal with the undead horde, the Raevan mages turn to their strategic allies, the Order of Dawn.": "在奥斯托亚内战中，索玛拥有更大的军队，由对布拉克战争中身经百战的老兵组成，并辅以亡灵攻击队。另一方面，雷沃有它的巫师。他们的魔法使他们能够与人数更多的索马里人相提并论，诱使士兵们互相厮杀。为了对付亡灵部落，雷沃法师们求助于他们的战略盟友--黎明骑士团。",
	"While Raevo does not have mining resources as extensive as Soma, it does possess more arable land. Supplementing this by fishing and hunting, Raevans generally have a more stable food supply and thus a higher standard of living than their counterparts in Soma.": "虽然雷沃没有像索玛那样广泛的采矿资源，但它确实拥有更多的可耕地。通过捕鱼和打猎作为补充，雷沃人通常有更稳定的食物供应，因此比索玛的同行有更高的生活水平。",
	"Where the Raevans possess their real edge is the burgeoning industry of crafting magical items. The Raevans greatly admire magic and have the highest concentration of wizards and alchemists in Ostoya. The skill of their artisans has generated fame for Raevo and their wares are highly sought after in other nations. In particular, golems are considered the pinnacle of craftsmanship in Raevo, though the prohibitive cost of making one makes their production rare. Still, any visitor to Castalore will doubtlessly marvel at the city's roving bands of golem honour guards.": "雷文家族真正的优势在于新兴的魔法物品制作行业。雷文家族非常推崇魔法，在奥斯托亚拥有最集中的巫师和炼金术士。他们工匠的技能为雷沃带来了声誉，他们的产品在其他国家备受追捧。特别是，巨兽被认为是雷沃手工艺的巅峰，尽管制作巨兽的成本过高，使得它们的产量很少。尽管如此，任何来到卡斯塔洛的游客无疑都会对城市里游荡的巨魔仪仗队感到惊叹。",
	"Soma has enacted strict edicts against magical items and has blocked trade routes going to Raevo to weaken their economy, yet the mages have still found ways to smuggle goods in and out of the province. Finding out their trade secrets would certainly put one in the good graces of the Soman nobility.": "索玛对魔法物品颁布了严格的法令，并封锁了去往雷沃的贸易路线，以削弱他们的经济，然而法师们仍然找到了走私货物进出该省的方法。发现他们的贸易秘密肯定会让人得到索曼贵族的好感。",
	"The Order of Dawn - When the Crimson Court was established, a number of Somans fled their vampire overlords and settled in the sympathetic fledgling republic of Raevo. These dissidents settled in a fort outside of Castalore, where they formed a militia fully committed to the destruction of the undead and the liberation of Soma. Thus, was the Order of Dawn formed.": "黎明骑士团--当深红法院成立时，一些索玛人逃离了他们的吸血鬼霸主，并在富有同情心的新兴共和国雷沃定居。这些持不同政见者在卡斯塔洛尔外的一个堡垒定居，在那里他们组成了一支民兵，完全致力于消灭亡灵和解放索玛。因此，黎明骑士团成立了。",
	"To call the Order fanatics would not be out of line. From childhood, each member is taught to hate the undead. Every such monster has been studied and dissected; their weaknesses carefully catalogued.": "说骑士团是狂热分子也不为过。从童年开始，每个成员都被教导要憎恨亡灵。每一个这样的怪物都被研究和剖析过；他们的弱点被仔细编排。",
	"While few in number, each member of the Order is trained and battle-ready. They are prepared to give their lives for their cause, and no vampire can expect mercy from them.": "虽然人数不多，但骑士团的每个成员都训练有素，随时准备战斗。他们准备为自己的事业献出生命，任何吸血鬼都不能指望他们的仁慈。",
	"Currently, the Order is led by General Artemios Dulka, a Soman noble who abdicated his title to escape the vampire curse. In retaliation, the vampires massacred the entirety of his family that remained in Soma. A good man at heart, Dulka is driven by hatred towards the Soman Aristocracy and will stop at nothing to destroy the undead. He will attack any vampire on sight.": "目前，骑士团由阿特米奥斯-杜尔卡将军领导，他是索玛贵族，为了逃避吸血鬼的诅咒而放弃了自己的头衔。作为报复，吸血鬼屠杀了他留在索马的全部家人。杜尔卡是个内心善良的人，他被对索曼贵族的仇恨所驱使，不惜一切代价来消灭亡灵。他将攻击任何见到的吸血鬼。",

Warchief Aymeric called attention to the wars between humans and the rest of the world and how they brought bloodshed and grief for all involved. From the near extinction of the gnomes to the destruction of the dragonborn's homeland, humanity had fallen far from the virtues of honour and justice. King Aymeric remarked that if they continue this war, they would be no different from the other human tribes of Etharis. With much work and every kind of diplomacy, Aymeric Noblecoeur at last convinced the other warlords to end the war, unify the tribes as one kingdom, and share the responsibilities of the land with the elves through the Pact of the Sacred Land. For this great and noble achievement he was crowned by both humans and elves as King Aymeric Noblecoeur, the first king of Charneault.": "人类军阀起初拒绝了这个协议，发现自己处于指挥地位，而精灵们几乎被打败。然而，正是现在高高在上的传说中的国王，艾默里克-诺贝尔科尔，提高了他的声音，为两个民族之间的和平而奋斗。艾默里克酋长呼吁人们注意人类和世界其他地方之间的战争，以及它们如何为所有参与的人带来流血和悲伤。从地精的濒临灭绝到龙裔家园的毁灭，人类已经远离了荣誉和正义的美德。艾默里克国王说，如果他们继续这场战争，他们就会和伊萨利斯的其他人类部落没有区别。通过大量的工作和各种外交手段，Aymeric Noblecoeur最终说服了其他军阀结束战争，将各部落统一为一个王国，并通过《圣地契约》与精灵分享土地的责任。由于这一伟大而崇高的成就，他被人类和精灵加冕为艾默里克-诺布尔国王，即查尔纳奥特的第一位国王。",

All attempts to circumvent this tribute have brought disaster upon the people of Charneault and so it is still upheld diligently to this day.": "它规定，查诺特的国王，以及他之后的每个国王，必须把他的第一个女儿送到精灵巫师那里，由他们用他们的方式来训练她。这个女儿被带到迷雾神庙，在她的余生中服务。她在神庙中履行的具体任务从未向邦德会以外的任何精灵或人类透露。所有试图规避这一贡品的行为都给查诺特的人们带来了灾难，因此直到今天，它仍然被勤奋地维护着。",
	"The pact between the two peoples also involves a clear distribution of the tasks necessary to protect the Charneault Kingdom. The Elves promised to help in appeasing the Spirits of Nature, responsible for strange and supernatural manifestations, wherever they happened.

	"In return, the humans promised to maintain a permanent force of knights across the entire kingdom, with the exception of Tol Leyemil, to protect both the population and nature itself. Swearing to defend the forests their ancestors burned to the ground. They also promised to help elven refugees to migrate from outside the kingdom to Tol Leyemil. At that time several Knight Chapters were founded and assigned specific missions, such as patrolling the kingdom, guarding the borders, guarding the area surrounding Tol Leyemil, and escorting the Bondmakers.": "作为回报，人类承诺在整个王国保持一支永久性的骑士队伍，除了托尔-莱伊米尔之外，以保护人口和自然本身。发誓要保卫他们祖先烧成灰烬的森林。他们还承诺帮助精灵难民从王国外迁移到Tol Leyemil。当时成立了几个骑士分会，并分配了具体的任务，如巡逻王国、守卫边境、守卫托尔-莱伊米尔周围地区，以及护送盂兰盆会的人。",

	"The situation worsened within the elven city when some elven leaders expressed greater ambitions over the land of the Kingdom. Claiming that Caer Neiada had been an elven territory for far longer than it had been inhabited by humans. They called for a retaking of their territory reserved for the elves beyond Tol Leyemil, to help spread the population which had come to the city. Factions developed for and against these claims. One of the most vindictive of these factions was the Dark Elves, who counted many sorcerers among their number. Impatient with the slow shift of opinion in favour of expansion, the Dark Elves seized the initiative in an attempt to escalate the situation.": "当一些精灵领袖对王国的土地表达了更大的野心时，精灵城内的情况恶化了。声称Caer Neiada作为精灵领土的时间远比人类居住的时间长。他们呼吁重新夺回他们在托尔-莱伊米尔之外为精灵保留的领土，以帮助分散来到城市的人口。支持和反对这些主张的派别不断发展。这些派别中最具报复性的是黑暗精灵，他们中有许多巫师。黑暗精灵对有利于扩张的缓慢舆论转变感到不耐烦，他们抓住了主动权，试图使局势升级。",

	"Dark Elf thieves retrieved a book of forbidden spells from which Lord Sorcerer Diyanthar, the mightiest of the Dark Elf sorcerers, learned to take control of the Spirits of Nature, an act considered sacrilege by the elves. They enacted a ritual that would use the Mist to convey their enchantments across the Kingdom, defiling the very roots of the land and creating an opening for sorcerers to take control of spirits. The Dark Elves' leaders intended to bind the Spirits of Nature against their will to fight in the war to retake all of Caer Neiada. However, to accomplish such a task, they needed to sacrifice a pure heart. They seized the opportunity when the new king, Thibault de Sauveterre, came to Tol Leyemil to offer his daughter, Princess Tiphaine de Sauveterre, in keeping with the pact. A group of Dark Elves, disguised as the princess' official escort from Tol Leyemil, kidnapped the princess. They did indeed bring her to the Temple of Mists, but once there, Dark Elf sorcerers began their ritual with the princess at its nexus. Soon a dark mist appeared above the temple and alarmed the city of Tol Leyemil. By then it was too late to stop the ritual. Everything would have worked according to Diyanthar's plans, had not a valiant knight intervened.": "黑暗精灵的盗贼们取回了一本禁咒书，黑暗精灵最强大的巫师迪扬萨从这本书中学会了控制自然之灵，这是一种被精灵们视为亵渎的行为。他们制定了一个仪式，利用迷雾在整个王国传达他们的魔法，玷污了土地的根基，为巫师们控制精神创造了一个机会。黑暗精灵的领导人打算违背自然之灵的意愿，将它们捆绑在战争中，以夺回整个卡尔-内亚达。然而，为了完成这样的任务，他们需要牺牲一颗纯净的心。当新国王蒂博-德-索维泰尔（Thibault de Sauveterre）来到托尔-莱伊米尔（Tol Leyemil），将他的女儿蒂凡-德-索维泰尔（Tiphaine de Sauveterre）公主献上，以遵守契约，他们抓住了机会。一群黑暗精灵伪装成公主的官方护卫队从托尔-莱伊米尔出发，绑架了公主。他们确实把她带到了迷雾神殿，但一旦到了那里，黑暗精灵巫师就开始在神殿的结点对公主进行仪式。很快，寺庙上方出现了一团黑雾，惊动了托尔-莱伊米尔城。到那时，要阻止仪式已经太晚了。如果不是一位英勇的骑士介入，一切都会按照迪扬萨的计划进行。",
	"Ser Guilhem le Preux is one of the most renowned knights of the Charneault Kingdom. He is first known for having sworn two mystic oaths with powerful spirits. But what made him truly renowned was his honorable yet unsatisfied love for Princess Tiphaine. Despite the Pact of Sacred Land, he asked for her hand and begged her royal father not to send her to the Temple of Mist. The princess was said to secretly return Guilhem's love, but neither would dare to go against the word of King Thibault. The king was deeply saddened by the situation as he felt in his heart that their love was true. But as king, he could not abandon the ancient pact, for fear of the consequences.": "Guilhem le Preux爵士是Charneault王国最著名的骑士之一。他首先是因与强大的神灵宣誓而闻名。但使他真正闻名的是他对蒂菲娜公主光荣而不满足的爱。尽管有《圣地契约》，他还是向她求婚，并恳求她的王室父亲不要把她送到雾之神殿。据说公主秘密地回报了吉勒姆的爱，但两人都不敢违背蒂博特国王的话。国王对这种情况深感悲哀，因为他从心里觉得他们的爱情是真实的。但作为国王，他不能放弃这个古老的约定，因为他担心后果。",
	"When Ser Guilhem heard the king's decree, he swore an oath to never love another than Princess Tiphaine and to live a life of a knight errant. But a short time after he left, the spirits with whom he had taken an oath contacted him to warn him that the princess was in grave danger.": "当Guilhem爵士听到国王的命令时，他发誓永远不爱比Tiphaine公主更多的人，并过着游侠的生活。但在他离开后不久，与他发过誓的神灵与他联系，警告他公主正处于严重危险之中。",
	"He made haste to Tol Leyemil and found the group of Dark Elves sailing towards the Temple of Mists with her. He followed them and, thanks to his renewed magical powers, managed to reach the temple shortly after the ritual started. Gathering all his courage, he fought his way through the Dark Elf escort and managed to strike a blow to Diyanthar. The ritual was interrupted, but both Guilhem and Diyanthar were caught, alongside Princess Tiphaine, in a magical explosion when the ritual collapsed.": "他急忙赶到托尔-莱伊米尔，发现那群黑暗精灵正带着她驶向迷雾神殿。他跟着他们，由于他重新获得了魔力，在仪式开始后不久就设法到达了神庙。他鼓起所有的勇气，穿过黑暗精灵的护卫队，成功地打击了迪扬萨。仪式被打断了，但吉勒姆和迪扬萨都被抓了起来，与蒂凡公主一起，在仪式崩溃时被卷入了一场魔法爆炸。",
	"Of the ten elven shamans who were sent to the Temple of Mists to find out what happened, only the Grand Shaman Aethorion returned. He did not bring good news. The ritual had indeed been interrupted, but its effects had not been completely prevented, and from that day forth the Mist was unstable. Sometimes grey as it had ever been, it can also take on a dark taint which proves extremely dangerous; wherever it appears, it throws the Spirits of Nature into turmoil, making their manifestations far more dangerous. Dark tales of villages slaughtered by monstrous creatures led by Dark Elf sorcerers and bewitched dark knights began to spread in the land.": "被派往迷雾神殿查明情况的十位精灵萨满中，只有大萨满艾瑟瑞恩回来了。他并没有带来好消息。仪式确实被打断了，但它的影响并没有完全被阻止，从那天起，迷雾就不稳定了。有时灰蒙蒙的，就像以前一样，它也会带着黑暗的污点，证明是极其危险的；无论它出现在哪里，都会使自然之灵陷入动荡，使它们的表现更加危险。关于村庄被黑暗精灵巫师和被迷惑的黑暗骑士领导的畸形生物所屠杀的黑暗故事开始在这片土地上传播。",
	"The Dark Elves and their allies fled from Tol Leyemil and headed to the dead city of Tol Kerdywel, hiding their movements with the Dark Mist. It is said that by doing so, they were following Diyanthar's last orders.

	"There is no certainty about the fate of Princess Tiphaine and Ser Guilhem, but both have apparently been seen as apparitions in the Mists, calling for help to lift their curse. As for Diyanthar, he also seems to be trapped in the Mist, as no trace of him could be found anywhere in the Kingdom. But that does not mean he has become harmless, as each time he is seen in the mist, dark creatures appear shortly after...": "目前还不能确定蒂菲娜公主和吉勒姆爵士的命运，但两人显然都被视为迷雾中的幽灵，呼唤帮助以解除他们的诅咒。至于迪扬萨，他似乎也被困在了迷雾中，因为在王国的任何地方都找不到他的痕迹。但这并不意味着他已经变得无害，因为每次他在迷雾中被看到时，黑暗生物都会在不久后出现......",
	"A fervent love for the land is the feature that best defines the people of the Charneault Kingdom. From the lower classes to the rich families there is a common saying: \"Do not spoil, or be foiled.\" Many people devotedly work in agriculture or fishing the rivers, and nature usually has returned their care, rewarding the hard worker with heavy yields if he treats his land kindly.": "对土地的狂热热爱是最能体现夏尔诺特王国人民的特点。从下层社会到富裕家庭，都有一句共同的说法。\"不要糟蹋，否则就会受挫\"。许多人全心全意地从事农业或在河边捕鱼，而大自然通常也回报了他们的关怀，如果勤劳的工人善待他的土地，他就会得到丰厚的回报。",
	"The faith in the Spirits of Nature has become quite strong among the lower classes, who believe that not thanking the local Spirits is the best way to attract the Mist and troubles. This has sadly become even more strongly believed with the arrival of the Dark Mist, and not without good reasons. The life of a farmer had been relatively safe for generations but now it is far more dangerous. As the Mist intensifies, the most superstitious do not dare to go to the fields when the Mist is near, or signs of it, dark or not. This has led to disruption of agriculture in the entire kingdom and led to shortages, something unseen for many decades.": "在下层阶级中，对自然之灵的信仰变得相当强烈，他们认为不感谢当地的神灵是吸引雾气和麻烦的最好方法。可悲的是，随着黑雾的到来，这一点变得更加坚信不疑，而且并非没有充分的理由。几代人以来，农民的生活都是相对安全的，但现在却危险得多。随着黑雾的加剧，最迷信的人不敢在黑雾临近时去田里，或有黑雾的迹象，或没有。这导致了整个王国农业的中断，并导致了短缺，这是几十年来从未见过的事情。",
	"With the population in turmoil, the Kingdom turned to the knights for protection. Facing popular clamour, King Thibault authorised an increase in the numbers of each Knight Chapter in an attempt to restore order and the feeling of security. Knighthood being admired among the populous, it did not take long for many new applicants to be knighted, especially by the most ambitious Knight Chapters. However, this influx of new knights has also increased rivalry between Knight Chapters, and quarrels between opposing knights and their families have become frequent.": "随着人口的动荡，王国向骑士们寻求保护。面对民众的喧嚣，蒂博国王授权增加每个骑士分会的人数，试图恢复秩序和安全感。骑士精神在民众中受到推崇，没过多久就有许多新的申请者被授予了骑士身份，尤其是那些最有野心的骑士分会。然而，这种新骑士的涌入也增加了骑士分会之间的竞争，对立的骑士和他们的家人之间的争吵也变得频繁。",
	"All in all, the people of the Kingdom are people used to enduring a life of labour and service to a higher cause.": "总而言之，王国的人民是习惯于忍受劳动和为更高事业服务的人。",
	"Knighthood is a highly codified institution in the Charneault Kingdom. Any squire willing to become a knight must first arm themself and leave their home on a quest. They bear a blank shield during their quest until they have accomplished their first deed of bravery. Once achieved, the squire can assert the right to bear a coat of arms on their shield. If the squire helped in some way to fulfill the mission assigned to a Chapter, they can then wear the arms of that Chapter.": "骑士制度在查尔纳奥特王国是一个高度规范的制度。任何愿意成为骑士的侍从都必须首先武装自己，离开家去探险。他们在探险过程中带着一面空白的盾牌，直到他们完成了第一个勇敢的行动。一旦完成，侍从可以要求在他们的盾牌上印上纹章的权利。如果侍从以某种方式帮助完成了分配给某个分会的任务，那么他们就可以佩戴该分会的徽章。",
	"Sometimes during their quest, a knight might meet a Spirit of Nature and gain their trust through their noble acts and behaviour. The most renowned knights are those who have manage to enter the service of such a Spirit by taking an oath to protect and serve them until the Spirit chooses to release them.": "有时在探险过程中，骑士可能会遇到自然之灵，并通过其高尚的行为和表现获得他们的信任。最著名的骑士是那些通过宣誓保护和服务自然之灵的人，直到自然之灵选择释放他们。",
	"In return, the knight is blessed with powers that vary widely depending on the Spirit to which the oath was taken.": "作为回报，骑士被赋予了各种权力，这些权力因宣誓的精神而有很大不同。",
	"Those few knights achieving such prowess are also granted a place on the Royal Council, a select council of knights that report directly to the king and who he trusts with the most important of envevours.": "少数取得这种能力的骑士还被授予皇家委员会的席位，这是一个由骑士组成的精选委员会，直接向国王报告，国王将最重要的恩赐交给他们。",
	"The bond with nature has always been stronger for the elves than any other race of Etharis. From the many generations spent living in connection with nature, the elves have acquired many skills and deep knowledge. However, they have also developed a powerful sense of superiority towards humans, who are unable to feel the beating pulse of the world. Many elves suspect some significance in the fact that the gradual Rotting of the World has mostly coincided with the rise of humanity in Etharis. This has of course deepened the enmity between humans and other races, an enmity that has spread all over the world to varying degrees.": "对精灵来说，与自然的联系一直比伊萨利斯的任何其他种族都要强。从许多代人与大自然的联系中，精灵们获得了许多技能和深刻的知识。然而，他们也对人类产生了一种强大的优越感，因为人类无法感受到世界的跳动脉搏。许多精灵怀疑，世界的逐渐腐烂大多与人类在伊萨利斯的崛起相吻合，这有一定的意义。这当然加深了人类和其他种族之间的敌意，这种敌意已经在不同程度上扩散到世界各地。",
	"According to wise, ancient elves, the fact that Spirits of Nature are rarely seen elsewhere in Etharis is due to the Rotting of the World. Apart from a handful of locations hidden in the most remote parts of Etharis, the Charneault Kingdom seems to be the last region of the world where the Spirits of Nature are sometimes visible. Thus is it no surprise that only in Charneault are the elves openly maintaining bonds with the Spirits.": "根据聪明的古代精灵的说法，自然之灵在Etharis的其他地方很少被看到，这是因为世界的腐烂造成的。除了隐藏在伊萨利斯最偏远地区的少数地点外，查尔纳奥特王国似乎是世界上最后一个有时能看到自然之灵的地区。因此，只有在Charneault，精灵们才会公开地与精灵们保持联系，这并不奇怪。",
	"However the Rotting of the World has not left elves untouched, even in the protected land of Caer Neiada. Some have developed deviant behaviour and ideologies that threaten the cohesion of what remains of the elven civilization.": "然而，世界的腐烂并没有让精灵们不受影响，即使是在受保护的卡尔-内阿达（Caer Neiada）的土地上。一些人已经发展出离经叛道的行为和意识形态，威胁到精灵文明所剩的凝聚力。",
	"Mystical creatures, usually {@condition invisible} to humans, the Spirits of Nature are supposed to be present everywhere at all times according to the elven sacred texts. They are manifestations of the raw magical energy inhabiting water, earth, rocks, plants, and trees.": "自然之灵是一种神秘的生物，通常对人类来说（0%），根据精灵族的圣典，自然之灵应该在任何时候都存在。他们是居住在水、土、岩石、植物和树木中的原始魔法能量的表现。",
	"When the Mist falls upon a place, sometimes it will arouse manifestations from the nearby Spirits. The Spirits are very sensitive to the feelings of living beings in their territory and will react accordingly. Sometimes their manifestations are indirectly beneficial to inhabitants, but other times, when the spirit senses turmoil, it will react poorly. From mazes in which people can be lost for hours or even days, to illusions that trap people or curse them, the tales of malicious or dangerous manifestations have long stopped being counted.": "当雾气落在一个地方时，有时会引起附近鬼魂的表现。神灵对其领地内生物的感受非常敏感，会做出相应的反应。有时它们的表现会间接对居民有利，但其他时候，当精神感觉到动荡时，它的反应会很差。从人们可能迷失几个小时甚至几天的迷宫，到困住人们或诅咒他们的幻觉，关于恶意或危险表现的故事早已不计其数。",
	"Such situations have to be handled sooner or later, as they will otherwise almost always lead to the manifestation of monstrous creatures, set off by the anxious spirit. It is rare for the situation to go this far, but when it does only the intervention of an elven Bondmaker escorted by Vermeil Knights can settle the situation.": "这种情况迟早都要处理，否则几乎总是会导致由焦虑的精神所引发的畸形生物的显现。这种情况很少会发展到这种程度，但当它发生时，只有由维米尔骑士护送的精灵骨匠的干预才能解决这个问题。",
	"There are beings that none wish to mention too often: tales of creatures that should not exist, and of people that did exist... but vanished. When the Dark Mist spreads too far and too thick, creatures of darkness appear and spread terror. From werewolves to giant spiders, the tales are plentiful, and many of them are based on reality.": "有一些生命，没有人愿意经常提及：关于不应该存在的生物的故事，以及关于确实存在的人......但却消失了。当黑雾蔓延得太远、太浓时，黑暗的生物就会出现并散布恐怖。从狼人到巨型蜘蛛，这些故事非常多，而且其中许多都是基于现实。",
	"Such is the power of the dark magic that corrupts the noble Spirits of Nature and exploits their power. It is not a threat to be taken lightly, and King Thibault de Sauveterre has recently reinforced the Wind Walkers, the Knight Chapter in charge of scouting the land and carrying messages. The ability to respond quickly is a key asset in protecting the people against such dangerous manifestations.": "这就是黑暗魔法的力量，它腐蚀了高贵的自然之灵并利用它们的力量。这不是一个可以轻视的威胁，Thibault de Sauveterre国王最近加强了风行者，负责侦查土地和传递信息的骑士分会。快速反应的能力是保护人民免受这种危险表现的关键资产。",
	"The name of Aymeric Noblecoeur has lasted through the centuries as the paragon of inner nobility. His honorable reputation is matched only by his physical stature. Tales of his height are so numerous that some even call him Aymeric Géantcoeur, the Giant-King. Other tales describe his sword, said to be the largest blade ever forged. The truth of these tales doesn't really matter though. Above all Noblecoeur is remembered for the Pact of Sacred Land that he signed with the elves of Tol Leyemil.": "艾默里克-诺贝尔科尔的名字作为内在贵族的典范，已经持续了几个世纪。他尊贵的名声只有他的体格才能与之匹配。关于他的身高的传说是如此之多，以至于有些人甚至称他为艾默里克-诺贝尔科尔，巨人王。其他故事描述了他的剑，据说是有史以来最大的刀。不过这些故事的真相并不重要。最重要的是Noblecoeur因为与Tol Leyemil的精灵们签订的圣地契约而被人记住。",
	"By gathering the human people of Caer Neiada under his authority, Noblecoeur ended decades of rivalry and conflict, enabling the human tribes to be a unified kingdom and end the conflict with the elves. This is what actually tipped the scales in favour of armistice and finally led to peace.": "通过将凯尔-内阿达的人类聚集在他的权力之下，诺贝尔科尔结束了几十年的竞争和冲突，使人类部落成为一个统一的王国，并结束了与精灵的冲突。这实际上是使停战的天平倾斜，最终导致了和平。",
	"Once a gathering of disparate tribes that had settled in Caer Neiada, over time Charneault developed into a powerful and wealthy kingdom. After the Pact of Sacred Land, the kingdom's population and wealth grew rapidly. Castles were constructed, and the roads to connect them. The most famous of these is Castle Lamesdhonneur, the capital of the kingdom, built between huge waterfalls. The network of new roads between settlements, guarded by the Knight Chapters, allowed people to travel safely and push the boundaries of the kingdom. Yet no one dared to settle too close to the dark area of Tol Kerdywel or in the forests surrounding the Temple of the Mists.": "曾经是定居在卡尔内亚达的不同部落的聚集地，随着时间的推移，查尔纳奥特发展成为一个强大而富有的王国。在《圣地契约》之后，王国的人口和财富迅速增长。城堡被建造起来，还有连接它们的道路。其中最著名的是王国的首都拉姆斯德讷尔城堡，它建在巨大的瀑布之间。由骑士团守卫的定居点之间的新道路网络，使人们能够安全地旅行并推动王国的边界。然而，没有人敢于在太靠近托尔-克尔迪维尔的黑暗地区或迷雾之神庙周围的森林中定居。",
	"The Knight Chapters grew during this time, each chapter managing particular aspects of the kingdom's needs in order to maintain its course of progress.": "骑士分会在这一时期不断壮大，每个分会都管理着王国需求的特定方面，以保持王国的进步进程。",
	"The Charneault Kingdom has always valued greatness of soul and heart above bloodlines. When the Kings dies or feels his time has passed, the Royal Council gathers to appoint his successor. As the Royal Council is composed of the most valiant knights, the new king is usually chosen from within their number. Succession to the throne is granted to the knight who has shown the most nobility in the service of the Kingdom. The most valuable deeds that determine the new king are swearing oaths with Spirits and the accomplishment of daring quests. The Knight Chapters are powerful actors within the kingdom's politics, and their Chapter Masters are the most valiant and renowned knights. This positions them as obvious candidates for the throne.": "查尔纳奥特王国一直重视伟大的灵魂和心灵，而不是血统。当国王去世或觉得他的时代已经过去时，皇家委员会就会聚集起来任命他的继任者。由于皇家委员会由最英勇的骑士组成，新国王通常从他们中选出。王位的继承权授予在为王国服务中表现出最高贵的骑士。决定新国王的最有价值的事迹是与神灵宣誓和完成大胆的任务。骑士分会是王国政治中强有力的参与者，他们的分会会长是最英勇和最著名的骑士。这使他们成为王位的明显候选人。",
	"One of the most influential Chapters among the knights are the Severe Templars. Once a minor entity, they rapidly grew in influence when the threat of Dark Elves emerged. Today they openly despise the elven civilization and would gladly revive the ancestral war. They consider Mystic Oaths to be foul sorcery and swear by force of arms alone. This state of mind aligns with their mission, which consists of maintaining law and order. They have strongholds near most important cities and castles in the kingdom, from which they send out their patrols. It is whispered in hushed voices throughout the land that the Severe Templars' Chapter Master Hermand le Sévère, who unsuccessfully competed toe-to-toe with Thibault de Sauveterre for the succession to the throne, is secretly plotting his revenge to take control of the kingdom. The Vermeil Guards are another major Knight Chapter of the kingdom.": "骑士中最有影响力的分会之一是严酷圣殿骑士团。他们曾经是一个小实体，当黑暗精灵的威胁出现时，他们的影响力迅速增长。今天，他们公开鄙视精灵文明，并乐于恢复祖先的战争。他们认为神秘的誓言是肮脏的巫术，只靠武力来发誓。这种心态与他们的使命相一致，即维护法律和秩序。他们在王国中最重要的城市和城堡附近设有据点，并从那里派出巡逻队。整个国家都在低声议论，严厉圣殿骑士团的分会会长赫尔曼-勒-塞弗尔（Hermand le Sévère）在与蒂博-德-索韦特尔（Thibault de Sauveterre）竞争王位继承权时未获成功，他正在秘密策划报复，以控制王国。维尔梅尔卫队是王国的另一个主要骑士分会。",
	"Their sacred duty is to escort the Bondmakers, elven shamans, as they assist the kingdom to reinforce the bonds with the Spirits of Nature and thus maintain the peace. Only the most virtuous and devoted knights are accepted into this chapter, as it requires a true faith in the Pact of Sacred Land and in the symbiosis established between elves, humans, and nature. This mutual faith between the protector knights and the shamans grants superhuman capabilities to the knights. Once knighted, they wear vermeil armour—silver overlaid with gold—as a sign of respect and allegiance.": "他们的神圣职责是护送精灵巫师Bondmakers，因为他们协助王国加强与自然之灵的联系，从而维护和平。只有最美德和最虔诚的骑士才会被接受加入这个章节，因为这需要对圣地契约以及精灵、人类和自然之间建立的共生关系的真正信仰。保护者骑士和巫师之间的这种相互信仰赋予了骑士们超人的能力。一旦被授予骑士身份，他们就会穿上镶有黄金的银色盔甲，作为尊重和效忠的标志。",
	"The Charneault Kingdom's economy relies heavily on agriculture and fishing. Hunting is limited by the great turmoil it provokes among the Spirits of Nature. Fishing, meanwhile, can be focused on intensively thanks to the many streams that weave their way through the kingdom. The Rockteeth mountains also house several mines that supply the kingdom's craftsmen, including the elven artisans of Tol Leyemil.": "查尔纳奥特王国的经济在很大程度上依赖于农业和渔业。狩猎因其在自然之灵中激起的巨大动荡而受到限制。同时，由于有许多贯穿王国的溪流，可以集中精力进行捕鱼。罗克提斯山脉还有几个矿场，为王国的工匠们提供原料，包括托尔-莱伊米尔的精灵工匠们。",
	"Exchange between the Charneault Kingdom and the outer world becomes less and less each year, as the Grove Maze is a barrier not worth crossing unless there is considerable profit to be had. The days when elves regularly travelled between Caer Neiada and other parts of Etharis are long gone and all but forgotten, and nowadays the Charneault Kingdom is almost an autarky.": "Charneault王国和外部世界之间的交流一年比一年少，因为丛林迷宫是一个不值得跨越的障碍，除非有可观的利润。精灵们经常往返于凯尔-内阿达和伊萨里斯其他地区的日子早已过去，几乎被遗忘，如今的查尔纳奥特王国几乎是一个自给自足的国家。",
	"{@b {@i King Thibault de Sauveterre}} - Crowned only five years ago, the new king struggled to claim the throne in the face of dire competition from Hermand le Sévère, Chapter Master of the Severe Templars. Thibault prevailed by only a single vote. Even though he has a good reputation among the people, he has had to deal with many disruptions in the kingdom, not least of which is the reluctance of the other Knight Chapters. These travails would have been enough alone, without the recent events of the Dark Elf Curse.": "{@b {@i King Thibault de Sauveterre}}--五年前才加冕的新国王，面对严厉的圣殿骑士团分会会长赫尔曼-勒-塞弗尔的激烈竞争，努力争取王位。蒂博仅以一票之差胜出。尽管他在人民中拥有良好的声誉，但他不得不处理王国中的许多干扰因素，其中最重要的是其他骑士分会的不情愿。如果没有最近发生的黑暗精灵诅咒事件，光是这些苦难就足够了。",
	"The origins of the elven settlement of Caer Neiada are lost to the night of time, as is the construction date of Tol Leyemil. However, many elves claim that Tol Leyemil is the most ancient elven city on this side of the Great Sea, and the city's impressive, convoluted, and worn-out architecture stands as proof of its immemorial age.": "凯尔-内阿达（Caer Neiada）的精灵定居点的起源已经消失在时间的长河中，托尔-莱伊米尔的建造日期也是如此。然而，许多精灵声称托尔-莱伊米尔是大洋此岸最古老的精灵城市，而这座城市令人印象深刻、错综复杂、破旧不堪的建筑也证明了它不朽的历史。",
	"Detailed history of Tol Leyemil and the elves of Caer Neiada is hard to come by as the elves themselves don't like to share their history, or indeed their city, with humans. History books probably exist in the ancient libraries of the city, but they are well guarded and no human has been allowed to visit them to this day.": "Tol Leyemil和Caer Neiada的精灵们的详细历史很难得到，因为精灵们自己不喜欢与人类分享他们的历史，甚至他们的城市。历史书可能存在于城市的古老图书馆中，但它们被看守得很好，至今没有人类被允许访问它们。",
	"Even if the Green Elves, who prefer to live in communion with raw nature, are indeed the first elven group to inhabit Caer Neiada and have been the largest population in the city until recently, Tol Leyemil has always been a cosmopolitan place.": "即使喜欢与原始自然共生的绿精灵确实是最早居住在卡伊尔-内阿达的精灵群体，并且直到最近都是城市中最大的人口，但托尔-莱伊米尔一直是一个国际化的地方。",
	"Elves of all origins have been freely accepted and welcomed since time immemorial, and this has further reinforced the legitimacy of the political system of the city.": "自古以来，各种出身的精灵都被自由地接受和欢迎，这也进一步加强了城市政治体系的合法性。",
	"The city of Tol Leyemil and its surroundings are ruled by Achen Elavain, which could be translated in the common tongue as The Assembly of the Elves\". It is a gathering of randomly designated elven citizens, who lead the city for a tenure of 20 years. Such a tenure is not overly-long for the elves, who can live for centuries. This system aims as much as possible to prevent personal ambitions from getting in the way of the greater good of the elven civilization.": "托尔-莱伊米尔城及其周边地区由阿肯-艾拉维恩统治，在普通话中可译为 \"精灵议会\"。这是一个由随机指定的精灵公民组成的集会，他们领导这个城市，任期为20年。这样的任期对精灵来说不算太长，他们可以活上几个世纪。这个系统旨在尽可能地防止个人野心妨碍精灵文明的更大利益。",
	"Although not part of the Achen Elavain, the shamans, especially Bondmakers, are nonetheless important and influential actors in Tol Leyemil thanks to their unequalled ability to transmit the messages of nature. They are always represented in the official gatherings of the Assembly of Elves, although their opinions are strictly consultative. The Grand Shaman Aethorion is renowned even among shamans for his wisdom and foresight.": "虽然不属于Achen Elavain，但巫师，尤其是Bondmakers，在Tol Leyemil是重要的、有影响力的角色，这要归功于他们传递自然信息的无以伦比的能力。他们总是有代表参加精灵大会的正式集会，尽管他们的意见是严格的咨询性的。大萨满Aethorion甚至在萨满中也以其智慧和远见闻名。",
	"Much like the humans of the Charneault Kingdom, the elves rely heavily on fishing for their subsistence. Unlike the humans, however, they do not only fish in the rivers. As Tol Leyemil is a short river cruise to the sea, many fishing vessels come and go along the coast. The coast also shelters many well-maintained orchards that benefit from the temperate climate and provide heavy yields of fruits that are used for food and wines, the recipes for which are well-guarded secrets of the elven growers.": "与查尼奥特王国的人类一样，精灵们在很大程度上依靠捕鱼来维持生计。然而，与人类不同的是，他们不只在河里捕鱼。由于托尔-莱伊米尔离海很近，许多渔船在海岸边来来往往。海岸边还有许多维护良好的果园，这些果园受益于温带气候，提供了大量的水果，用于制作食物和葡萄酒，这些水果的配方是精灵种植者们精心保护的秘密。",
	"Trade between Tol Leyemil and the Charneault Kingdom used to flourish. The elves rely on Charneault cereals to feed their surging population, while humans of the Kingdom buy fruits, fine beverages, and sea fish from the elves. Though the demand still exists, things have worsened since the events of the Dark Elf Curse. Even if war has not returned, trust between elves and humans has been damaged, and trade has suffered as a result.": "托尔-莱伊米尔和查尔尼奥特王国之间的贸易曾经很繁荣。精灵们依靠Charneault的谷物来养活他们激增的人口，而王国的人类则从精灵们那里购买水果、高级饮料和海鱼。虽然需求仍然存在，但自黑暗精灵诅咒事件以来，情况已经恶化了。即使战争没有卷土重来，精灵和人类之间的信任也受到了损害，贸易也因此受到影响。",
	"{@b {@i Aethorion, Green Elf Grand Shaman}} - One of the mightiest sorcerers of his time, if not the very mightiest, Aetherion is the leader of the elven shamans, a renowned Bondmaker who walked the land for many decades. He is reputed to have the strongest connection to the Spirits of Nature ever seen, and through this to have gained the gift of foresight. His advice is given great weight by the Elven Assembly, to the continuing consternation of his main rival, Diyanthar.": "{@b {@i Aethorion, Green Elf Grand Shaman}} - Aetherion是他那个时代最强大的巫师之一，甚至是最强大的，他是精灵巫师的领袖，是著名的邦德制造者，在这片土地上行走了几十年。他被认为与自然之灵有着前所未有的紧密联系，并因此获得了预知的天赋。他的建议得到了精灵议会的高度重视，他的主要竞争对手迪扬萨对此一直感到不安。",
	"{@b {@i Diyanthar, Dark Elf Lord Sorcerer}} - Ambitious, talented, and charismatic, Lord Sorcerer Diyanthar acquired an influential position in record time in Tol Leyemil. Some would argue that this meteoric rise was not unrelated to his skill with the magic of mind manipulation, a controversial branch of magical studies. His insatiable curiosity led him to delve deep into forbidden magical territory and pushed him to plot and execute the treason by the Dark Elves (and other elven followers) known as the Dark Elf Curse.": "{@b {@i Diyanthar, Dark Elf Lord Sorcerer}}--雄心勃勃、才华横溢、魅力四射，巫师迪扬萨大人在创纪录的时间内获得了在托尔-莱伊米尔有影响力的地位。有人会说，这种如日中天的崛起与他的心灵操纵魔法的技能不无关系，这是一个有争议的魔法研究分支。他贪得无厌的好奇心使他深入到被禁止的魔法领域，并推动他策划和执行了被称为黑暗精灵诅咒的黑暗精灵（和其他精灵追随者）的叛乱。",
	"{@b {@i Thaelkinei, the Lich Princess}} - Thaelkinei was a wise and beautiful elven princess of ancient times. Only the oldest elven books contain any reference to her. In those ancient times, when the world was mainly inhabited by elves who themselves were still a young race, the elves made great progress in their insatiable search for knowledge. Thaelkinei was a sorceress who went too far in that search and disregarded the sacred bond between magic and nature.": "{@b {@i Thaelkinei, the Lich Princess}} - 塔赫金妮是古代一位聪明美丽的精灵公主。只有最古老的精灵书籍中才有关于她的记载。在那些古老的时代，当世界主要由精灵居住时，他们自己还是一个年轻的种族，精灵们在对知识永不满足的探索中取得了巨大的进步。Thaelkinei是一个女巫，她在这种探索中走得太远，无视了魔法和自然之间的神圣联系。",
	"When they discovered ways to control nature through magic, most elven sorcerers and sorceresses understood that they had found a limit that must not be crossed. To avoid catastrophe, they forbade the use of what would later be called dark magic. However, Thaelkinei was proud, even for an elf, and refused to stop studying. Her royal lineage, her thirst for power, and her deep cunning drove her to push even further. She conceived an immeasurably powerful spell, the Web of Ascendancy, that aimed not simply to control parts of nature or particular Spirits, but the entire land itself. She cast the spell from her castle of Tol Kerdywel, granting herself almost godlike powers: she could change the very form of the land or control any living creature in the region of Tol Kerdywel.": "当他们发现通过魔法控制自然的方法时，大多数精灵巫师和女巫都明白，他们已经发现了一个不能逾越的界限。为了避免灾难，他们禁止使用后来被称为黑魔法的东西。然而，Thaelkinei很骄傲，即使对一个精灵来说也是如此，并拒绝停止学习。她的王室血统，她对权力的渴望，以及她深沉的狡诈，驱使她进一步努力。她构思了一个不可估量的强大咒语--\"升天之网\"，其目的不仅仅是为了控制自然界的某些部分或特定的精神，而是为了控制整个土地本身。她在她的托尔-凯尔迪维尔城堡里施展了这个咒语，赋予自己几乎是神一样的力量：她可以改变土地的形态，或者控制托尔-凯尔迪维尔地区的任何生物。",
	"Only the alliance of several elven kingdoms from across the world was enough to counter the threat Thaelkinei posed, and the gathered elven sorcerers managed to create a counterspell. Even then, they could not completely overcome Thaelkinei's spell, so instead were forced to use another even more powerful forbidden spell: the Curse of Unchanging, a powerful magical web that engulfed the area of Tol Kerdywel and bound every living thing inside in a magical sleep. It was as if time had stopped entirely, for the people, the flora, and the fauna. This terrible spell still holds in Tol Kerdywel, and despite the danger, the region's supposedly unguarded wealth has attracted the boldest adventurers.": "只有来自世界各地的几个精灵王国的联盟才足以对抗Thaelkinei带来的威胁，聚集在一起的精灵巫师们设法创造了一个反咒语。即使如此，他们也无法完全克服Thaelkinei的咒语，所以反而被迫使用另一个更强大的禁咒：不变的诅咒，一个强大的魔法网，吞噬了Tol Kerdywel地区，将里面的每个生物都束缚在魔法的睡眠中。仿佛时间完全停止了，对人们、植物和动物来说都是如此。这个可怕的咒语仍然保留在托尔-凯尔迪维尔，尽管有危险，但这个地区所谓的毫无防备的财富吸引了最大胆的冒险家。",
	"{@b {@i The Temple of the Mists}} - At the south of the Charneault Kingdom lies the source of the Mists that regularly cover the land. The heart of the region is occupied by an ancient volcano, and the Temple of the Mists itself lies in what remains of its caldera, worn down by eons of erosion.": "{@b {@i The Temple of the Mists}}--在查尼奥特王国的南部，是经常覆盖这片土地的迷雾之源。该地区的中心被一座古老的火山所占据，而迷雾之神殿本身就位于其火山口的残余部分，被漫长的侵蚀所侵蚀。",
	"Although the crater still dominates the landscape, it is often hidden, at least in part, by the Mists. The intricate network of rivers, lakes and other streams that abound all around the volcano make it even harder to find one's way to the temple.": "虽然火山口仍然主导着景观，但它经常被迷雾所掩盖，至少是部分掩盖。火山周围错综复杂的河流、湖泊和其他溪流，使人们更难找到通往神庙的路。",
	"Therefore it is no surprise that no one foolish enough to attempt to reach the temple without invitation ever returns. Many in the Charneault Kingdom say that those who ventured to the temple were bewitched by malevolent Spirits, while others say that they actually found the temple, but are imprisoned there forevermore.": "因此，没有一个愚蠢到试图在没有邀请的情况下到达神庙的人回来，这并不奇怪。查尔纳奥特王国的许多人说，那些冒险前往神庙的人被恶灵所迷惑，而其他人则说，他们确实找到了神庙，但却被永远囚禁在那里。",
	"The only people capable of locating the Temple of Mists without guidance are the elven shamans that regularly perform rituals there.": "唯一能够在没有指引的情况下找到迷雾神殿的人是经常在那里举行仪式的精灵巫师。",
	"They are bound to silence and will not willingly share the way to the temple. As yet no one has tried to force them, as they are powerful sorcerers.": "他们被束缚在沉默中，不会心甘情愿地分享通往神庙的道路。迄今为止，还没有人试图强迫他们，因为他们是强大的巫师。",
	"A ceremony is regularly held in the temple to release the Mists. Many tales and stories speak of what the ceremony entails, and why the Mists are released on the Kingdom, but the truth is known only to the highest elven authorities and they will not share the secret. All they revealed when the Pact of Sacred Land was made was that the Mists must be released from the temple or the entire region would surely be thrown into darkness.": "在神庙中定期举行释放迷雾的仪式。许多传说和故事都提到了这个仪式的内容，以及为什么要在王国上释放迷雾，但真相只有精灵族最高当局知道，他们不会分享这个秘密。在订立《圣地契约》时，他们所透露的是，必须从神庙释放迷雾，否则整个地区肯定会陷入黑暗。",
	"{@b {@i Tol Kerdywel}} - The western part of the Charneault Kingdom is a place even more dangerous than the Temple of Mists. Indeed it is a wicked land where the trees have no leaves and the waters are dark as night. This cursed land is dominated by the dead city of Tol Kerdywel, where Thaelkinei, the Lich Princess, lies dormant.": "{@b {@i Tol Kerdywel}}--查尼奥特王国的西部是一个比迷雾之殿更危险的地方。的确，这是一片邪恶的土地，那里的树木没有叶子，水面漆黑如夜。这片被诅咒的土地以死亡之城托尔-凯尔迪维尔（Tol Kerdywel）为中心，巫妖公主塔赫金尼（Thaelkinei）就在那里休眠。",
	"{@b {@i Dark Oak Grove}} - A halfling caretaker and her many companions once tended a wondrous forest of towering black oak trees on the outskirts of Tol Kerdywel. In her capable hands the grove flourished, and travelers from across the kingdom came to admire the wild sanctuary of rare and beautiful flora and fauna. In her spare time, the halfling took in sick and injured animals and nursed them back to health, maintained the underground springs, and tended to the trees, who she maintained whispered secrets of old to her.": "{@b {@i Dark Oak Grove}}--一个半身人看守人和她的许多同伴曾经在托尔-克尔迪维尔的郊区照看一片由高耸的黑橡树组成的奇妙森林。在她干练的双手下，这片树林欣欣向荣，来自王国各地的旅行者都来欣赏这片拥有稀有和美丽动植物的野生保护区。闲暇时，半身人收留生病和受伤的动物，照顾他们恢复健康，维护地下水泉，并照料树木，她认为这些树木对她说了很多古老的秘密。",
	"However, travellers today will find no such splendour. The grove has become a place of death and decay. Its once-magnificent oaks have rotted from the inside out, spotted with mushrooms and furred tendrils.": "然而，今天的旅行者将发现没有这样的辉煌。这片丛林已经成为一个死亡和腐烂的地方。它曾经的宏伟橡树已经从里到外腐烂了，长满了蘑菇和毛茸茸的卷须。",
	"The burbling springs that used to flow abundantly have turned to stagnant mires filled with quicksand and waterborne insects. The scent of wildflowers and pine has turned to rotting wood and the decaying corpses of half-eaten creatures. The animals of the grove in the time of the halfling fled shortly after her disappearance, and those that stayed became prey for the new predators who took up residence. Those who have attempted to cultivate the grove and restore its former beauty find that introduced species are eaten or perish from disease, plants wither and die from the now-salty soil, and the water is brackish and undrinkable.": "过去流淌着的潺潺泉水已经变成了充满流沙和水生昆虫的停滞沼泽。野花和松树的香味已经变成了腐烂的木头和被吃掉一半的生物的腐烂尸体。半身人时代的小树林里的动物在她失踪后不久就逃走了，那些留下来的动物成了新的捕食者的猎物，他们在这里定居下来。那些试图开垦丛林并恢复其以前的美丽的人发现，引进的物种被吃掉或因疾病而灭亡，植物因现在的咸水土壤而枯萎和死亡，水是咸的，不能饮用。",
	"Some say a terrible bargain was negotiated in order for such a foul place to persist, while others maintain that the grove is an extension of Tol Kerdywel. One thing is certain though: those who venture into Dark Oak Grove return permanently altered, as if the decay and stagnation have settled into their very being. They are plagued with dreams of death and cruelty, and often experience vivid hallucinations of being a walking corpse. Regardless of their destination, wise travellers avoid the grove at all costs.": "有些人说，为了让这样一个肮脏的地方继续存在下去，人们进行了一场可怕的交易，而其他人则坚持认为，这个丛林是托尔-凯尔迪维尔的延伸。但有一点是肯定的：那些冒险进入黑暗橡树林的人回来后会被永久地改变，仿佛腐烂和停滞已经融入他们的身体。他们被死亡和残酷的梦境所困扰，经常会出现生动的幻觉，认为自己是一具行尸走肉。无论他们的目的地是哪里，聪明的旅行者都会不惜一切代价避开这个丛林。",

The settlement boasts thriving fishing and agriculture, but export is limited to the neighbouring towns and villages within the Charneault Kingdom. Physicians can access the village's herb depository for medicinal ingredients, and use the crafting facilities there to make various elixirs and remedies. Some of the herbs grown in the depository are particularly rare and potent, and care must be exercised when mixing them. The depository's seer, Grechia, tends to the plants and is able to source cuttings of rare herbs for a small fee. Lycanthropes researching a cure for their curse frequently pillage the depository, much to the annoyance of Grechia and the village's physicians.": "{@b {@i The Shaded Haven}}--由凯宁-阿拉巴斯特（Kainen Alabaster）定居的阴影港湾是一个湖边小村庄，是许多最近变身的狼人的避难所。该定居点拥有繁荣的渔业和农业，但出口仅限于邻近的城镇和查尼奥特王国的村庄。医生们可以从村里的草药库中获取药材，并使用那里的工艺设施来制作各种药水和药方。储藏室里种植的一些草药特别稀有和有效，在混合它们时必须小心。存放处的预言家格雷奇亚（Grechia）负责照料这些植物，并能以小额费用获得稀有草药的扦插。研究治愈他们诅咒的狼人经常掠夺储藏室，这让格蕾琪亚和村里的医生非常恼火。",

Thus was Gormadraug defeated.": "大巫师很快就把他们全部吞下了。但即使在野兽的肚子里，一切也没有失去。七个人发现，戈马德拉克的心脏就在它的肚子旁边。当米特拉弹奏她的竖琴以哄骗巫妖入睡时，西尔、弗尔格和肯蒂根将他们的剑刺入了怪物的心脏。就这样，戈玛德劳格被打败了。",

	"The half-orc hero Thorgard is said to have originated from Clan Völgr on the island of Holgar. Seeing the chaos and suffering brought about by Valikan disunity, he sought the help of a hag who could see into the future. The hag told him that he could unite the clans by taking on the role of their war chief and leading them on a campaign against the foreign invaders. The hag advised Thorgard to tell the clans that he was the reincarnation of Kentigern, First Hero of the North. To help with the tale, he needed to find an artifact similar to Kentigern's legendary weapon Bane-Slayer, a magical double-bladed sword—one blade covered in frost, the other in flames.": "半兽人英雄索尔加德据说来自霍尔加岛上的沃尔格氏族。他看到瓦利坎（Valikan）的不统一带来的混乱和痛苦，便向一位能够预见未来的巫婆寻求帮助。女巫告诉他，他可以通过担任他们的战争首领，带领他们对外国侵略者展开战役，从而团结各部族。女巫建议索尔加德告诉各部落，他是北方第一英雄肯蒂根的转世。为了帮助讲述这个故事，他需要找到一件与肯蒂根的传奇武器 \"屠龙刀 \"类似的文物，这是一把神奇的双刃剑，一把剑上覆盖着冰霜，另一把剑上则是火焰。",
	"Thorgard went on a quest for such a weapon and did manage to find it. What he did not realise for some time was that he had discovered Kentigern's real weapon, the Bane-Slayer. Thus the legend of Thorgard began with a self-fulfilling prophecy.": "索尔加德去寻找这样的武器，并且确实设法找到了它。但他在一段时间内没有意识到，他已经发现了肯蒂根的真正武器--屠龙刀。因此，索尔加德的传说以一个自我实现的预言开始。",
	"With the weapon in hand, he traveled throughout Grarjord, facing each clan and bringing them into his steadily growing army. Some leaders he convinced through diplomacy, others through acts of service. With his mortal enemy, the Sarvif of the Sýr Clan, he fought a duel to the death that lasted three days and nights. With that victory, all six clans united under Thorgard's banner, their swords and axes sharpened, and their longships lining each harbor.": "带着这把武器，他走遍了格拉乔德，面对每一个部族，把他们带入他稳步增长的军队。他通过外交手段说服了一些领导人，其他的则是通过服务行为。他与他的死敌，西尔部族的萨尔维夫进行了一场持续三天三夜的生死决斗。随着这场胜利，所有六个部族都团结在托尔加德的旗帜下，他们的剑和斧头都磨得很锋利，他们的长船在每个港口都有。",
	"With his army, Thorgard moved against the foreign invaders. He raided their coastal settlements and drew out their armies into the field. A great battle was fought in the tundra, and within a season, the foreigners were driven south, their colonies abandoned. The North was free once more.": "索尔加德带着他的军队，对外国侵略者采取行动。他袭击了他们的沿海定居点，并将他们的军队引向战场。在苔原上进行了一场伟大的战斗，在一个季节内，外国人被赶到南方，他们的殖民地被遗弃。北方再次获得了自由。",

	"Within western Grarjord lies the land of Thrull, a forbidding land dotted with icy peaks and frozen forests. While the land shows hints of green from afar, its soil is of poor quality for farming. Thus those who live there feed themselves the only way they can—by taking from other lands. Upon the island of Holgar lies their capital, the harbor city of Tyburn, a central port for longships.": "Grarjord西部是Thrull的土地，这是一片充满冰峰和冰冻森林的禁忌之地。虽然这块土地从远处看有一丝绿色，但其土壤质量很差，不适合耕种。因此，生活在那里的人只能通过从其他地方获取食物的方式来养活自己。在霍尔加岛上有他们的首都，泰伯恩港市，一个长船的中心港口。",
	"Three clans settled on the island of Holgar: the Rune, who embody elemental magic best; the Sýr, great metalsmiths; and the Völgr, a warrior society.

	"The disappearance of Thorgard, left the clans with a power vacuum. Warlords immediately began vying for control of Grarjord. But one individual took a different course. On Holgar, an elemental druid named Kybard gained power by advocating a strange belief: that Gormadraug still lives but sleeps beneath the earth and sea. Should it awaken, it would bring about the end of the world. To keep it in slumber, the Valikan must follow the time-honoured traditions of Thorgard: war, raiding, and bloodshed.": "索尔加德的消失，给各族留下了权力真空。军阀们立即开始争夺格拉乔德的控制权。但有一个人采取了不同的做法。在霍尔加，一个名叫凯巴德的元素德鲁伊通过鼓吹一种奇怪的信仰获得了权力：戈马德拉格仍然活着，但沉睡在大地和海洋之下。如果它苏醒，就会带来世界的末日。为了保持它的沉睡，瓦里肯人必须遵循索尔加德历史悠久的传统：战争、袭击和流血。",
	"Though originally met with opposition, Kybard's teachings found adherents among the clan leaders. The three largest clans-the Rune, the Sýr, and the Völgr-joined together under Kybard's banner and called their province Thrull.": "虽然最初遭到了反对，但凯巴德的教义在部族领袖中找到了追随者。三个最大的部族--卢恩（Rune）、西尔（Sýr）和沃尔格（Völgr）--在凯巴德的旗帜下联合起来，称他们的省份为瑟鲁尔。",

	"At this time, the leader of the clans is Chief Nolgr Magnusson of the Völgr, Keeper of the Three Tribes. Magnusson enjoys the approval of the Circle, and cannot be easily dislodged from his position through force of arms alone. A warmonger, Magnusson is more interested in earthly rewards and regularly sends raiding parties to attack Kandar towns and cities.": "此时，各部族的领袖是三部落的守护者--沃尔格族的诺尔格-马格努森酋长。马格努森得到了圈子的认可，仅靠武力是无法轻易将其赶下台的。作为一个战争贩子，马格努森对尘世的奖赏更感兴趣，并经常派遣突击队袭击坎达尔的城镇和城市。",
	"Most of the Thrull economy is derived from their traditions of raiding and slavery. The Thrull have perfected the art of raiding: longboats carry small contingents of warriors aided by druids. The druids command the tides to carry the ships swiftly through the sea, and allowing them to approach their victims under cover of fog. Etharian ships and ports have learned to fear the coming of the sea mists.": "瑟鲁尔人的大部分经济都来自于他们的突袭和奴役传统。瑟鲁尔人已经完善了突袭的艺术：长船载着由德鲁伊协助的小队战士。德鲁伊们指挥着潮汐让船只在海中迅速航行，并允许他们在雾的掩护下接近他们的受害者。伊萨里亚人的船只和港口已经学会害怕海雾的到来。",
	"Fishing, hunting, smithing, and whaling round off the list of the Thrull industries. Trade is kept within the three clans: the Rune produce elixirs and enchanted runestones, the Sýr forge weapons, shields, and armour, and the Völgr train fighters. A black market exists for trading with other nations, but this practice is forbidden by the druids, who want to maintain the Thrull's isolationist stance.": "渔业、狩猎、铁匠和捕鲸是瑟鲁尔的全部产业。贸易保持在三个部族内部：符文部生产灵药和施了魔法的符石，西尔部锻造武器、盾牌和盔甲，沃尔格部训练战士。存在一个与其他国家进行贸易的黑市，但这种做法被德鲁伊禁止，因为他们想保持瑟鲁尔的孤立主义立场。",

	"Lief soon learned to control his own inner beast. Freeing other slaves, he created a pack of werewolves and settled on a small island southwest of the mainland. He has since built a small army from rescued slaves and other like minded individuals. Twenty times the Thrull clans have sent a warlord to put down his rebellion and that many warlords have died in the attempt.": "利夫很快就学会了控制自己内心的兽性。释放了其他奴隶后，他创建了一个狼人群体，并在大陆西南的一个小岛上定居。此后，他用获救的奴隶和其他志同道合的人建立了一支小型军队。瑟鲁尔氏族曾20次派军阀去镇压他的叛乱，许多军阀都死在了这一尝试中。",
	"Lief has declared his sanctuary free of the Prismatic Circle's influence.": "利夫已经宣布他的避难所不受棱镜圈的影响。",

	"Grenhildr - Any theocracy eventually creates its own nemesis, and so it is for the Prismatic Circle. A former druid of the Prismatic Circle, Grenhildr was excommunicated for her belief that the Great Wyrm holds the key to the world's salvation and thus should be revived.

	"Fort Kentigern - At the edge of the ice bridge that links Volgen to the mainland is the fortress of the Order of Kentigern.

	"Rather, the Order of Kentigern is Grarjord's first line of defense against the encroaching coldfire menace from Volgen.

Evoker mages can hurl fireballs from the topmost ramparts.": "相反，肯特根骑士团是格拉乔德的第一道防线，以抵御来自沃尔根的冷火威胁。堡垒十英尺厚的墙壁上隐藏着弹射器和可以发射燃烧的沥青的风车。携带投弹手的冰龙可以在蓝色火焰出现的第一时间起飞。驱魔法师可以从最顶端的城墙上投掷火球。",

	"The teachings of the Divine Arch Seraphs—especially Empyreus, Arch Seraph of Valor-have slowly but surely transformed the provinces into a militarist theocracy, with a fierce mistrust of spellcasters.

Conflict has escalated to the point where the Arcanist Inquisition has launched a crusade to burn every magically gifted being in the Castinellan Provinces...and beyond.": "神圣的大Seraphs--尤其是Empyreus，英勇的大Seraph--的教诲已经缓慢但肯定地将该省转变为一个军国主义神权，对施法者有着强烈的不信任。但最近，对神圣的塞拉弗教义的新挑战使人们陷入混乱。冲突已经升级到了这样的地步：阿卡索宗教裁判所发起了一场十字军东征，要烧死卡斯蒂内兰省的每一个有魔法天赋的人......甚至更多。",
	"The Castinellan Provinces are a harsh land pincered between mountain and sea. It is a windswept peninsula, bounded by sea to east and west, with an irregular mountain spine running from north to south.

The east coast is wilder and less inhabited, exposed to the strong winds from the Great Eastern Sea.": "卡斯蒂内兰省是一块夹在山与海之间的严酷土地。它是一个饱受风吹雨打的半岛，东西两侧以海为界，有一条不规则的山脊从北向南延伸。西海岸面临狮子湾，那里的贸易路线通往莫伦西亚城邦和查尼奥特王国。东海岸比较荒凉，人烟稀少，暴露在大东海的强风中。",
	"Although the sea is never far, the provinces mostly suffer from a dry climate, due to the combined effects of constant winds and scorching heat. In that context, water has become the most precious resource, and the bigger cities have emerged on the shores of the few rivers flowing from the mountains, or, in the case of the great Salves River, from the northern part of Etharis.": "虽然大海从未远离，但由于持续的风和炎热的综合影响，各省大多遭受干燥的气候。在这种情况下，水已成为最宝贵的资源，较大的城市出现在从山区流来的几条河流的岸边，或者，就伟大的萨尔维斯河而言，从伊萨里斯北部流来。",

	"In the southernmost part of Castinella, the mountain chain abruptly breaks up into many strange mountain protrusions called the Shattered Peaks, with the Dragonborn city of Ember Cairn in their centre. Many small rivers run between these peaks, and the area, called Sante Viegre, has become dense with vineyards.": "在卡斯蒂内拉的最南端，山脉突然断裂成许多奇怪的山峰突起，被称为 \"破碎的山峰\"，龙裔城市 \"琥珀之巢 \"位于其中心。许多小河在这些山峰之间流淌，这个被称为Sante Viegre的地区已经有了密集的葡萄园。",

	"The south of Castinella was once the homeland of the Dragonborn race, and Ember Cairn was their most ancient and glorious city. But the Great Purge saw it destroyed, and legends tell that the mountains themselves were shaken in the catastrophe, and thus shaped into the Shattered Peaks.": "卡斯蒂内拉的南部曾经是龙裔种族的故乡，而微光巢穴是他们最古老、最辉煌的城市。但在大清洗中，它被摧毁了，而传说中，山脉本身也在这场灾难中受到了震动，因此被塑造成了破碎的山峰。",
	"With their homeland destroyed, the Dragonborn scattered throughout Etharis, avoiding further involvement in the war and searching for new meaning.": "随着他们的家园被摧毁，龙裔散落在整个伊萨利斯，避免进一步卷入战争，并寻找新的意义。",
	"Long after the events of the Great War, three provinces of Toletum, Faro, and Therpena took shape in Castinella, and continuously fought over the rich but unforgiving lands until they reached a violent equilibrium. Each time one province gained a dominant position, the other two would ally to bring it down and restore the stalemate. Therefore, none of the belligerents managed to overcome their counterparts for good until the time of Montego Valieda, the Unifier.": "大战结束后很久，Toletum、Faro和Therpena三个省在卡斯蒂内拉形成，并不断争夺富饶但无情的土地，直到他们达到激烈的平衡状态。每当一个省获得主导地位时，另外两个省就会结盟，将其打倒，恢复僵局。因此，在统一者蒙特哥-瓦利达（Montego Valieda）时代之前，没有一个交战方能够永远地战胜他们的对手。",
	"Valieda was the perfect example of Castinellan valor, but he was also a clever strategist.": "瓦利达是卡斯蒂内尔人勇敢的完美典范，但他也是一个聪明的战略家。",

However, he knew that without a significant advantage the Corovans could not prevail in the long term, as history had proven.": "他出生在科罗瓦山麓，带领托勒图姆部队战胜了它的两个对手。然而，他知道，如果没有显著的优势，科罗瓦人不可能长期获胜，历史已经证明了这一点。",
	"Valieda departed to wander the highest part of the mountains, a particularly dangerous area subject to sudden, violent storms, and reputedly unexploitable for mining. Whether by destiny or luck, Valieda was spared from the storms and came back, claiming to have had a revelation from the Arch Seraph Empyreus. The Sword Saint, as many called Empyreus, had apparently invested Valieda with the holy task of unifying all Castinellan Provinces, not under the rule of Corova or any other province, but under the sacred rules of the Arch Seraph himself. To help in this task, Valieda claimed, the Seraph had led him to a hidden valley where he revealed an exceptional vein of gold. Valieda quickly hired miners to exploit the vein and thus fuel Corova's economy and war effort.": "瓦利达离开后去了山区的最高处徘徊，那是一个特别危险的地区，会有突然的猛烈风暴，而且据说不适合采矿。不管是命运还是运气，瓦利达在风暴中幸免于难，并回来了，他声称得到了大蛇神恩皮里斯的启示。剑圣，正如许多人所称的Empyreus，显然赋予了Valieda统一所有卡斯蒂内利亚省的神圣任务，不是在科洛瓦或任何其他省份的统治下，而是在大祭司本人的神圣规则下。瓦利达声称，为了帮助完成这项任务，大祭司把他带到了一个隐蔽的山谷，在那里他发现了一个特殊的金矿脉。瓦利达很快就雇佣了矿工来开采这个矿脉，从而为科洛瓦的经济和战争努力提供动力。",
	"Valieda proclaimed his new allegiance to Empyreus and his intention of transforming Castinella into a theocracy, to put an end to the exhausting wars between the three provinces. His words became a motto that is still spoken by many clerics, priests and inquisitors:": "瓦利达宣布了他对Empyreus的新效忠，并打算将卡斯蒂内拉变成一个神权国家，以结束三个省之间令人疲惫的战争。他的话成为许多神职人员、牧师和审问者仍在说的座右铭。",
	"\"He who fights for himself shall fear death, for his steps are led by lust, and his deeds will fall into oblivion.": "\"为自己打仗的人要怕死，因为他的脚步被情欲引导，他的行为会被遗忘。",

	"Valieda and his followers proceeded to spread the teachings of the Arch Seraph to the three provinces. In time they gained complete theocratic influence over the provinces of Faro and Therpena, as their newly formed religion gained more war-weary followers. Finally, when they were unable to rally the last remnants of resistance to the holy cause, they overcame them either by gold or by iron and fire.": "瓦利达和他的追随者们继续向三个省传播大蛇神的教义。随着他们新形成的宗教获得更多厌战的追随者，他们及时获得了对法罗和特佩纳省的完全神权影响。最后，当他们无法召集最后的抵抗残余来支持神圣的事业时，他们就用黄金或铁和火战胜了他们。",
	"After unifying the three provinces, Sagrado Valieda ordered the creation of the religious order called the Arcanist Inquisition, whose function was to control and limit the use of magic in the provinces. According to what the Arch Seraph Empyreus had told Valieda, magic was a curse that endangered its wielders and everyone who associated with them.": "在统一了三个省之后，萨格拉多-瓦利达下令创建了名为 \"奥术师裁判所 \"的宗教组织，其职能是控制和限制各省对魔法的使用。根据大蛇神Empyreus告诉瓦利达的内容，魔法是一种诅咒，会危及其施用者和与之相关的所有人。",
	"The Inquisitors patrolled the provinces, spreading their teachings about the dangers of magic, stirring mistrust in the population. After some time, they began to arrest those known to be magically gifted and brought them to their cells, where they would supposedly live a life of humble service to the Arch Seraph. The Inquisitors were eager to find these people at the youngest possible age, as they claimed the threat of magic could be more easily contained in the young whose magical abilities had not fully emerged.": "审问者们在各省巡逻，传播他们关于魔法危险的教义，激起民众的不信任。一段时间后，他们开始逮捕那些已知有魔法天赋的人，并把他们带到他们的牢房，据说他们将在那里过着谦卑的服务于大蛇神的生活。审问者们渴望在尽可能小的年龄段找到这些人，因为他们声称魔法的威胁更容易在魔法能力尚未完全显现的年轻人身上得到控制。",
	"Sagrado Valieda later returned to the land of the Shattered Peaks among the Dragonborn. As missionaries of the Arch Seraph Empyreus spread their teachings across Etharis, some Dragonborn migrated back to the Castinellan Provinces. After centuries of wandering and resentment from the abandonment of their dragon gods, the scattered Dragonborn people had left behind their ancestral religion. Hence, they showed little hesitation to take hold of the new light that Empyreus offered. Seeing this, Sagrado Valieda seized the opportunity to strengthen Castinella and the Empyreus theocracy even more. He announced that all Dragonborn were welcome to reconstruct their former city of Ember Cairn, fallen eons ago, as long as they were raising it to the glory of Empyreus. As the Dragonborn were now the most zealous followers of the Divine Seraph, Valieda made Ember Cairn the headquarters of his newly created Arcanist Inquisition and raised the Cathedral of Embers.": "萨格拉多-瓦利达后来回到了龙裔中的碎峰之地。随着大蛇神Empyreus的传教士将他们的教义传遍Etharis，一些龙裔迁回了卡斯蒂内兰省。经过几个世纪的流浪和对他们的龙神被遗弃的怨恨，分散的龙族人留下了他们的祖先的宗教。因此，他们对接受Empyreus提供的新的光明没有表现出什么犹豫。看到这一点，萨格拉多-瓦利达抓住机会，进一步加强卡斯蒂内拉和Empyreus神权。他宣布，欢迎所有龙裔重建他们在几个世纪前沦陷的前城市微光之城，只要他们把它提升到Empyreus的荣耀。由于龙族现在是神圣塞拉弗最狂热的追随者，瓦利达将微光城作为他新创建的奥术师裁判所的总部，并建立了烬之大教堂。",
	"With the three provinces unified and a growing new state religion, the next step for the Castinellan Provinces was to turn their ambitious gaze outside, to the north and west. The city-state of Morencia was reaching its apogee, so it was a valuable and challenging target for the servants of the Divine Seraph Empyreus. After a few decades of unsuccessful intrigues and power struggles, the Castinellans took up arms and launched a surprise attack on Morencia. By suborning a member of the Morencian Navigators Guild, the Castinellan fleet was able to pass through the island-city's magical barrier, the Misty Reefs. However, the intervention of the Charneault Kingdom ruined the Castinellan plans, and though they inflicted heavy losses to the Morencian fleet, they finally lost the naval battle.": "随着三个省的统一和新国教的发展，卡斯蒂内尔省的下一步是将他们雄心勃勃的目光转向外面，转向北部和西部。莫伦西亚（Morencia）城邦正在达到它的顶峰，所以它是神圣的蛇神Empyreus的仆人们的一个有价值和有挑战性的目标。经过几十年不成功的阴谋和权力斗争，卡斯蒂内尔人拿起武器，对莫伦西亚发动了一次突袭。通过收买莫伦西亚航海家协会的一名成员，卡斯蒂内尔人的舰队得以通过该岛城的魔法屏障--迷雾暗礁。然而，查尼奥特王国的干预破坏了卡斯蒂内尔的计划，尽管他们给莫伦西亚舰队造成了严重损失，但他们最终还是输掉了这场海战。",
	"One of the ships within the defeated armada, the Fiery Lady, was cast adrift and driven far to the south, then to the east, by relentless winds. At this point, the ship had completely run out of supplies, but the crew had finally repaired the ship enough to control its course, and headed to the northwest in hope of finding land before they starved. But they made a surprising discovery during their approach to the coast: the submerged ruins of what seemed to be a vast complex. Unable to explore the ruins at the time, the captain noted enough information to find the ruins again in the future. Yet at that moment Castinellan society was turned towards the future, and the clergy proclaimed the ruins nothing more than more proof of mistakes made in the past.": "被打败的舰队中的一艘船，\"火夫人 \"号，被无情的风吹到了南方，然后又吹到了东方。此时，这艘船已经完全耗尽了补给，但船员们终于修复了这艘船，足以控制它的航向，并向西北方驶去，希望在他们饿死之前找到陆地。但他们在接近海岸时有了一个惊人的发现：被淹没的废墟，似乎是一个巨大的建筑群。当时无法探索废墟，船长记下了足够的信息，以便在未来再次找到废墟。然而在那一刻，卡斯蒂利亚社会转向了未来，神职人员宣布废墟只不过是过去所犯错误的更多证明。",
	"Some time later, however, rumours spread within Castinella that the Thaumaturge, a powerful confederation of archmages, had infiltrated the Castinellan Provinces and was about to take action against the theocracy. It is unknown if the rumours had anything to do with the discovery of the ruins, or with the Castinellan Provinces' provocative attack on Morencia, but the rumours spread all over the provinces, accusing the magic hating theocracy of a hidden, hypocritical agenda. These rumours were officially denied and declared heretical, a brand that extended to anyone even repeating the rumours. The Arcanist Inquisition launched the Great Purge in the provinces, redoubling their efforts to find spellcasters and, this time, to burn them. The same terrible fate also awaits anyone caught calling the Seraphic Teachings into question.": "然而，一段时间后，卡斯蒂内拉内部传出谣言，说Thaumaturge，一个强大的大法师联盟，已经渗透到了卡斯蒂内拉省，并准备对神权采取行动。不知道这些谣言是否与废墟的发现有关，或者与卡斯蒂内尔省对莫伦西亚的挑衅性攻击有关，但谣言传遍了各省，指责憎恨魔法的神权有一个隐藏的、虚伪的议程。这些谣言被官方否认，并被宣布为异端，这个品牌甚至延伸到了任何重复谣言的人。阿卡索宗教裁判所在各省发起了大清洗，加倍努力寻找施法者，这次是要烧死他们。同样可怕的命运也在等待着任何被抓到质疑塞拉弗教义的人。",
	"Since time immemorial there have been three provinces in this wind blasted southern part of Etharis. Though they are now united under the banner of the Divine Arch Seraph Empyreus, each province still holds notable particularities.": "自古以来，在Etharis南部被风吹过的地方就有三个省。虽然它们现在联合在神圣的大蛇神Empyreus的旗帜下，但每个省仍有明显的特点。",
	"Toletum is the house of power in the Castinellan Provinces, fueled by the mines of the Corova Mountains, and home of the region's most renowned military companies.": "托勒图姆是卡斯蒂内兰省的权力之家，以科罗瓦山脉的矿藏为燃料，是该地区最著名的军事公司的所在地。",
	"Since the establishment of the theocracy to the glory of the Arch Seraph Empyreus, Toletum has grown into a huge, industrious city that administers the affairs of all the Castinellan Provinces. Settled in a large curb of the Salves, just under the main massif of the Corova mountains, Toletum is an obligatory crossing point between the south of Castinella and the rest of Etharis. Merchants coming buying Castinellan goods or selling their own, official envoys, and convoys from the three provinces all converge on the city.": "自从神权制度建立以来，为了大祭司恩皮里乌斯的荣耀，托勒图姆已经发展成为一个巨大的、勤劳的城市，管理着所有卡斯蒂内拉省的事务。托勒图姆定居在萨尔维斯的一个大弯道上，就在科罗瓦山脉的主峰下，是卡斯蒂内拉南部和伊萨里斯其他地区之间的一个必经的交叉点。前来购买卡斯蒂内拉货物或出售自己货物的商人、官方使节以及来自三个省的车队都会聚集在这座城市。",
	"The Arch Basilica of Empyreus is the main complex where the rigorous laws of Castinella are made and amended, with the common denominator that all must follow the precepts of Empyreus.": "Empyreus大教堂是制定和修改Castinella严格法律的主要场所，其共同点是所有人都必须遵守Empyreus的戒律。",
	"It is not a surprise that the Watchers of the Faithful, a militant faction dedicated to serving the faith of the Arch Seraphs, have established their headquarters in Corova. Their High Priest Nola Cirdanal is a zealous follower of Empyreus and on good terms with the Castinellan clergy, who the Watchers offer generous discounts on their service in expeditions against the enemies of the true faith.": "信徒的守望者是一个致力于为大蛇夫的信仰服务的好战派，他们在科罗瓦建立了总部，这并不奇怪。他们的大祭司Nola Cirdanal是Empyreus的狂热追随者，与卡斯蒂内尔的神职人员关系良好，守望者在对真正信仰的敌人进行远征时为他们提供慷慨的折扣。",
	"Fueled by a constant flow from the mines of the Corova mountains, the Ember Forge occupy a vast area just downstream of the city, half built on the river to allow easy access to the water required to quench their handiwork. The forges never stop, filling the entire area with constant noise and smoke that nearly suffocates the city when the winds blow upstream.": "在科罗瓦山脉的矿场源源不断的推动下，微光锻造厂占据了城市下游的大片区域，有一半建在河边，以便于获得淬火所需的水，他们的手工作品。锻造厂从未停止过，整个地区充满了持续的噪音和烟雾，当上游的风吹来时，几乎使城市窒息。",
	"Most of the forges' production is dedicated to the Castinellan Provinces themselves, mainly to the Faro arsenals and the military companies installed in Toletum, but also to the Watchers of the Faithful, whose growing numbers require more and more steel to launch operations all over Etharis against those who deviate from the true faith of the Divine Seraphs.": "锻造厂的大部分生产都是为卡斯蒂内利亚省本身服务的，主要是为法罗兵工厂和安装在托勒图姆的军事公司服务，但也为忠实的守望者服务，他们越来越多的人需要越来越多的钢铁，以便在伊萨里斯各地对那些偏离神圣塞拉弗的真正信仰的人展开行动。",
	"Even before the times of the Unifier, Toletum was an industrious city that relied on metal processing and on military endeavours. The famous Toletum Squares were feared in battle for their tenacity and efficiency. Their combination of seasoned pikemen, crossbowmen, and shielded swordsmen dominated battlefields for centuries, and are still very efficient. Many mercenary companies sell their services in Toletum, either to the greater cause of the Castinellan theocracy or to foreign entities. They occupy huge areas outside Toletum where they train recruits, while their commercial offices are in the city centre. This intense military activity requires an equivalent weapon trade, hence the relentless work of the forges and armouries.": "即使在统一者的时代之前，托勒图姆也是一个依靠金属加工和军事努力的勤劳城市。著名的托勒图姆方阵在战斗中因其坚韧和高效而令人生畏。他们由经验丰富的长矛手、弩手和带盾牌的剑客组成的组合在战场上主宰了几个世纪，并且仍然非常高效。许多雇佣兵公司在托勒图姆出售他们的服务，或是为了卡斯蒂内尔神权的更大事业，或是为了外国实体。他们在托勒图姆之外占据了巨大的区域，在那里训练新兵，而他们的商业办公室则在市中心。这种密集的军事活动需要同等的武器贸易，因此锻造厂和军械库的工作是不间断的。",
	"As the most renowned mercenary army in Etharis, the Company of Free Swords has a significant post in Toletum. However, it is not often engaged with, as the Castinellan clergy dislikes their use of wizards. The Free Swords used to benefit from exceptional treatment on this, but the situation has been tense since the beginning of the Great Purge, and the Free Swords may not maintain their presence if things escalate further.": "作为Etharis最著名的雇佣军，自由之剑公司在Toletum有一个重要的职位。然而，它并不经常参与，因为卡斯蒂内尔的神职人员不喜欢他们使用巫师。自由之剑曾经在这方面享受过特殊的待遇，但自从大清洗开始后，局势一直很紧张，如果事情进一步升级，自由之剑可能不会保持他们的存在。",
	"Balancing at the fork of the Salves River, the fortified city of Faro stands proudly to govern and exploit the fertile area that hosts the great harbors, where most of the powerful Castinellan fleet is built and maintained.": "在萨尔维斯河的分岔口，法罗的防御城市骄傲地站在那里，管理和开发肥沃的地区，那里有巨大的港口，强大的卡斯蒂利亚舰队大多在那里建造和维护。",
	"Eons of erosion have sculpted an impressive cliff at the fork of the Salves, providing the ideal location for an impregnable fortress. The Farosi, as they call themselves, swiftly understood that their best way of defense was to control the river. Without a doubt, Faro is the most defensible city in all Castinella, maybe in all Etharis. The river provides a natural barrier on the west and north sides. The land to the south and east are so incredibly fertile that they are known as the Blessing. Moreover, the river and the nearby sea provide an incredible proliferation of fish, so it is no surprise that the people of Faro became mighty sailors and developed a close relationship with the sea.": "长年累月的侵蚀在萨尔维斯河的分叉处雕琢出一个令人印象深刻的悬崖，为一个坚不可摧的堡垒提供了理想的位置。法罗人，正如他们自己所称，迅速明白他们最好的防御方式是控制河流。毫无疑问，法罗是整个卡斯蒂内拉最易守卫的城市，也许是整个伊萨里斯最易守卫的城市。河流在西面和北面提供了一个天然屏障。南部和东部的土地肥沃无比，被称为 \"祝福\"。此外，河流和附近的大海提供了令人难以置信的鱼群，所以法罗人成为强大的水手并与大海建立了密切的关系也就不足为奇。",
	"The Faro area used to be ruled by a council of landowners, the landholders inside the Blessing carrying more weight in the decision making process than those on the western and northern riversides. Decisions needed to gather two thirds of the votes to be enacted, always making negotiations in the wake of wars very tense. Things have changed somewhat since the Unifier, though, and the Castinellan clergy now holds a predominant position in the decision making process.": "法罗地区曾经被一个地主委员会所统治，祝福区内的地主在决策过程中比西部和北部河边的地主更有分量。决策需要获得三分之二的票数才能颁布，这使得战争后的谈判总是非常紧张。不过，自统一者以来，情况发生了一些变化，卡斯蒂内尔的神职人员现在在决策过程中占据了主导地位。",
	"The economy of Faro is flourishing, benefitting from both land and sea. Inside the Blessing, the southern lands are full of salt marshes and shellfish farming installations, while the northern lands grow various grains, fruits, and vegetable crops. Outside the Blessing, high forests occupy the riversides, with hunting providing the main means of subsistence. This complete spectrum of food production creates good trade opportunities for the Farosi, while also allowing a total self-sufficiency in case of invasion, as long as the Mighty Fleet prevents invaders from entering the Blessing.": "法罗的经济蓬勃发展，同时受益于陆地和海洋。在福地内，南部的土地充满了盐沼和贝类养殖设施，而北部的土地则种植各种谷物、水果和蔬菜作物。在祝福之外，高大的森林占据了河边，狩猎是主要的生存手段。这种完整的食品生产范围为法罗西人创造了良好的贸易机会，同时也允许在入侵的情况下完全自给自足，只要强大的舰队阻止入侵者进入祝福之地。",
	"The Farosi relied on their naval capabilities to maintain their independence in the centuries before unification. Their naval superiority allowed them to launch raids deep inside enemy territory and prevent enemy fleets from attacking the Blessing from the sea. Since the unification, the Farosi Raiders are known as the Mighty Fleet. They dominate the Gulf of Lions, with trade routes along everyshore of Etharis. These ships are built in the Great Arsenals, which occupy most of the riversides of the southern river branch, and have taken a heavy toll on the high forests. Moreover, this deforestation has leached the soil and provoked landslides. The Farosi are aware of this and are trying to regenerate the forests, but after the crushing defeat of their attack against Morencia, there is no doubt that even more trees will be cut to rebuild the Mighty Fleet.": "在统一前的几个世纪里，法罗西人依靠他们的海军能力来维持他们的独立。他们的海军优势使他们能够深入敌方领土发动突袭，并阻止敌方舰队从海上攻击祝福族。自统一以来，法罗西突击队被称为 \"强大的舰队\"。他们主宰着狮子湾，沿着伊萨里斯的每一个海岸有贸易路线。这些船是在大兵工厂里建造的，它们占据了南河支流的大部分河岸，并对高大的森林造成了严重的破坏。此外，这种砍伐森林的行为还侵蚀了土壤，引发了山体滑坡。法罗西人意识到了这一点，正在努力使森林再生，但在他们对莫伦西亚的进攻遭到惨败后，毫无疑问，为了重建强大的舰队，甚至会有更多的树木被砍伐。",
	"Divided between the vineyards around the Shattered Peaks and the plains near the coast, the southernmost province of Therpena is also host to Ember Cairn, home city of the Dragonborn and headquarters of the dreaded Arcanist Inquisition.": "泰尔佩纳最南端的省份分为破碎山峰周围的葡萄园和靠近海岸的平原，也是龙裔的家乡和可怕的奥术师裁判所的总部--琥珀之穴的所在地。",
	"Viegre On the southeastern slopes of the mountains, Therpena's vineyards benefit from a warm temperate climate. The Shattered Peaks shelter them from the strongest winds and provide shade within the blistering heat, while the peaks catch rare but strong rains that feed rivers. Such conditions are perfect for growing fruit and especially grapes, from which the thoroughful winemakers create marvels that are highly prized all over Etharis. Merchants used to come from all over Etharis for first-hand access to the best wines in the great Therpena Wine Festival, but this tradition has lost most of its vigour as the Castinellan theocracy established progressively tighter regulations on the wine market. Now the government itself is the only exporter to legally deal with foreign buyers, setting steep prices and adding the profits to tax revenues. Naturally a black market has silently emerged. Smuggler ships regularly berth on the southern coast to load the extra production from bold, ambitious, or desperate winemakers. It is a risky endeavour indeed, as the Mighty Fleet of Castinella relentlessly patrols the coast of the three provinces. Smugglers must often risk sailing the high seas south-west before going north again towards Etharis. However, the Mighty Fleet has notably reduced its surveillance after losing many ships in the recent attack on Morencia.": "维格雷 在山脉的东南坡，特佩纳的葡萄园得益于温暖的温带气候。破碎的山峰为它们遮挡了最强的风，并在炎热的天气里提供了阴凉，而山峰上的雨水虽然稀少，但却能滋养河流。这样的条件非常适合水果，尤其是葡萄的生长，彻底的酿酒师从这些葡萄中创造出了奇迹，在整个伊萨利斯都非常珍贵。过去，商人们从Etharis各地赶来，在伟大的Therpena葡萄酒节上亲身品尝最好的葡萄酒，但由于卡斯蒂内尔神权对葡萄酒市场的管制逐渐严格，这一传统已经失去了大部分活力。现在，政府本身是唯一的出口商，可以合法地与外国买家交易，制定高昂的价格，并将利润纳入税收。自然而然地，一个黑市就悄然出现了。走私船定期停泊在南部海岸，装载来自大胆、雄心勃勃或绝望的酿酒师的额外产量。这确实是一项冒险的工作，因为强大的卡斯蒂内拉舰队无情地在三个省的海岸巡逻。走私者往往必须冒着风险向西南方向的公海航行，然后再向北驶向Etharis。然而，在最近对莫伦西亚的攻击中损失了许多船只后，强大的舰队已经明显减少了监视。",
	"Horsemanship is second nature to the people of Therpena, where riding has been elevated to an artform and a means of subsistence, in amazing riding shows and powerful military formations. The Therpena High Cavalry School offers training for all manners of riding. The Therpenan war riders are renowned throughout Etharis for their impressive ability in horseback fighting. Before the unification, they were Therpena's first line of defence, constantly harassing and ambushing their slower enemies with either vanguard ranged fire or surprising, bloody charges.": "骑术是特佩纳人民的第二天性，在这里，骑术已经被提升为一种艺术形式和生存手段，在惊人的骑术表演和强大的军事编队中。特尔佩纳高级骑兵学校提供各种形式的骑术训练。特尔佩纳战骑因其令人印象深刻的马背战斗能力而闻名于整个伊萨利斯。在统一之前，他们是特佩纳的第一道防线，不断地用先锋的远程火力或令人惊讶的血腥冲锋来骚扰和伏击他们较慢的敌人。",
	"The most renowned figure in Therpena, and probably the most renowned rider of all Etharis, is Aban Dhalrum, High Master of the Therpena High Cavalry School. At one with horses, Dhalrum has mastered all the domains of horse riding but is most known, and feared, for his martial abilities, having won an impressive number of battles and duels. Moreover, he reinforced the position of cavalry in ruling Therpena. Through clever diplomacy, he obtained funds to greatly expand the Therpenan War Riders in exchange for their services as escorts for the wine convoys and the occasional inquisitor.": "泰尔佩纳最有名的人物，可能也是所有伊萨利斯最有名的骑手，是泰尔佩纳高级骑兵学校的高级大师阿班-达勒姆。达鲁姆与马融为一体，他掌握了骑马的所有领域，但他最出名的，也是最令人畏惧的是他的武术能力，他赢得了大量的战斗和决斗。此外，他还加强了骑兵在统治特佩纳的地位。通过巧妙的外交手段，他获得了资金，大大扩充了特佩纳战骑，以换取他们为葡萄酒运输队和偶尔的审问者提供护送服务。",
	"{@b {@i Light of empyreus, a war state religion}} - The uncompromising nature of the Arch Seraph Empyreus is reflected in the laws that have transformed Castinellans' way of life. However, if there's no doubt that the unified Castinellan theocracy represents a major change for the three provinces, it would also be a lie to say that there were no grounds for its establishment. Indeed, strength, courage, and honour have long been valued among the Castinellans long before the time of the Unifier. With these three concepts at the core of Empyreus' teachings, the adoption of the faith to the Arch Seraph was natural. The aspect of Castinellan life changed most profoundly by Empyreus' teachings was the practice of war.": "{@b {@i Light of empyreus, a war state religion}}--大蛇神Empyreus的不妥协性反映在改变了卡斯蒂内尔人生活方式的法律中。然而，如果说统一的卡斯蒂内利亚神权代表着三个省的重大变化是毫无疑问的，那么说它的建立没有任何理由也是谎言。事实上，早在统一者时代之前，力量、勇气和荣誉就已经在卡斯蒂内尔人中得到了重视。由于这三个概念是Empyreus教义的核心，对大蛇夫的信仰的采纳是很自然的。卡斯蒂内尔人生活中被Empyreus的教义改变得最深刻的方面是战争的实践。",
	"Before the unification, Castinellans were quick to declare war on their neighbours over almost any provocation or pretext. In proclaiming his new faith, Sagrado Valieda achieved the considerable feat of channeling Castinellans' desire for war in one unique direction: the Righteous War, fought for a greater cause. Knowing their people could not become peace-loving overnight, Valieda and the clergy carefully crafted rules under which war would be waged. In fact, every form of law enforcement or other violent action became subject to detailed regulations. By creating a legal framework for violence, they bound and justified violence with higher ideals. This permitted them to easily subdue rebellions during the unification, declaring righteous war upon whomever dared to rise against the words of the clergy.": "在统一之前，卡斯蒂内尔人几乎以任何挑衅或借口迅速向他们的邻国宣战。在宣布他的新信仰时，萨格拉多-瓦利达取得了相当大的成就，将卡斯蒂内尔人对战争的渴望引向一个独特的方向：正义的战争，为一个更伟大的事业而战。知道他们的人民不可能在一夜之间变得爱好和平，瓦利达和教士们精心制定了发动战争的规则。事实上，每一种形式的执法或其他暴力行动都受制于详细的法规。通过建立一个暴力的法律框架，他们用更高的理想来约束暴力并为之辩护。这使他们能够在统一期间轻松制服叛乱，对任何敢于反对神职人员言论的人宣布正义的战争。",
	"{@b {@i Military organization}} - As a military theocracy, the Castinellan Provinces have adopted a uniform, rigorous military structure that mingles populations from the three provinces and at the same time boosts military efficiency.

	"Each Castinellan soldier is expected to serve two years in at least two different army corps, ensuring flexibility when reorganising troops during long military campaigns. Moreover, this distributes seasoned soldiers throughout the Castinellan armies, further enhancing their resilience.": "每个卡斯蒂利亚士兵都要在至少两个不同的军团中服役两年，以确保在长期军事行动中重组部队的灵活性。此外，这也使经验丰富的士兵分布在整个卡斯蒂利亚军队中，进一步增强了他们的适应性。",
	"Welcoming and festive - When they are not fighting for the greater good, Castinellans are eager to celebrate. They have many occasions, and many ways, to do so—be it the birth of a child or the end of a werewolf hunt, they rejoice and feast, sometimes for several days. Music and dance are always a major part of the celebrations, even if bound by rigorous customs. The musicians are exclusively males while the women enthrall the public with frenzied dances around a huge fire. Such is the way of things in Castinella, even in these dark times when spellcasters are persecuted without mercy. But for those who show no sign of magical impurity and who respect the Castinellan customs, there is always a place around the fire.": "欢迎和欢庆--当他们不为更大的利益而战时，卡斯蒂内尔人渴望庆祝。他们有很多场合，也有很多方式来这样做--无论是孩子的出生还是狼人狩猎的结束，他们都会欢呼雀跃，大吃大喝，有时甚至会持续数天。音乐和舞蹈始终是庆祝活动的主要部分，即使受到严格的习俗约束。音乐家都是男性，而女性则围绕着巨大的火堆狂热地跳舞，使公众陶醉其中。这就是卡斯蒂内拉的生活方式，即使是在这个施法者被毫不留情地迫害的黑暗时代。但是对于那些没有显示出魔法不纯的迹象并且尊重卡斯蒂内拉习俗的人来说，火堆周围总有一个位置。",
	"From grudges and vendetta to the Righteous War - The dark side of the Castinellans temper is, without doubt, their haste to turn to anger and violence when they feel that their honour has been violated.": "从怨恨和仇杀到正义的战争--毫无疑问，卡斯蒂内尔人脾气的阴暗面是，当他们觉得自己的荣誉受到侵犯时，急于转为愤怒和暴力。",

	"For centuries, grudges would be counted and transmitted over generations until the opportunity arose to enact a bloody vendetta.": "几个世纪以来，怨恨会被计算并世代相传，直到有机会进行血腥的仇杀。",
	"But after the unification, violence became a more regulated component of life in the Castinellan Provinces. Any act of war had to be supported by the clergy, who more often than not sent a group of Inquisitors to investigate the real motives of the belligerents. This slowed the outbreaks of violence, as those who dared to go against the sacred law were excommunicated and their property confiscated by the Empyreus clergy.": "但在统一后，暴力成为卡斯蒂内利亚省生活中一个更受管制的组成部分。任何战争行为都必须得到神职人员的支持，而神职人员往往会派出一组审问者来调查交战方的真正动机。这就减缓了暴力的爆发，因为那些敢于违背神圣法律的人被逐出教会，他们的财产被Empyreus神职人员没收。",
	"The disgraced were allowed to fight the Righteous War against the blasphemous in order to end their unworthy lives and seize their lands and goods for the benefit of Empyreus.": "失宠者被允许与亵渎者进行正义的战争，以结束他们不值得的生活，并夺取他们的土地和物品，以利于Empyreus。",

	"Some legends still tell how tall the city was, perched on a high mountain, made entirely of granite. The fact that they don't agree on what exceptional cataclysm destroyed the mountain, and the city along with it, mattered not for Dragonborns, who had already turned their backs on the past. They settled in the centre of the irregular and tortured mountain area known as the Shattered Peaks, and built their new city to the glory of the Arch Seraphs.": "一些传说仍在讲述这座城市有多高，坐落在一座高山上，完全由花岗岩构成。事实上，他们并不认同是什么特殊的大灾难摧毁了这座山，也摧毁了这座城市，但这对龙裔来说并不重要，他们已经背弃了过去。他们在被称为 \"破碎山峰 \"的不规则和折磨人的山区中心定居，并在大蛇夫的荣耀下建造了他们的新城市。",

According to rumours, the cells have no locks, and the Inquisitors let prisoners loose to determine whether or not they have magical abilities: if they find an exit, they are immediately recaptured and found guilty of magical impurity. Whether true or not, the fact remains that very few people are released from this place. Those who do get out seldom escape with a healthy body and mind. Though there are other rumours that one particularly skilled individual regularly enters, and exits, the Cathedral of Embers on their own, and unharmed, for a purpose unknown.": "奥术师裁判所总部是一个迷宫，只有训练有素的裁判员才能找到他们的路。根据传言，牢房没有锁，审问者放出囚犯以确定他们是否有魔法能力：如果他们找到出口，就会立即被重新抓回，并被认定为魔法不纯。无论真假，事实是很少有人从这个地方被释放。那些被放出来的人很少能带着健康的身体和心灵逃脱。虽然还有其他传言说，有一个特别有能力的人经常独自进入和离开余烬大教堂，而且毫发无损，目的不明。",
	"{@b {@i The Town of Thorpes}} - To all appearances, Thorpes is like any other devout town in the Castinella Provinces. Numerous temples and roadside shrines collect offerings to the Divine Seraphs, and the town maintains a modest chapter of the Arcanist Inquisition. But, as with any religion, not all of the town's congregants are willing followers. Under the cover of night in secluded buildings and slipways, the cult of the Broken Brothers amasses. A religious organization dedicated to the ways before Empyreus—some say even before the gods—they can be identified by their tattoos, created with vanishing ink to avoid the scrutiny of the Inquisition. Members of the Broken Brothers range from peasants to low-ranking clergy and nobles. Always looking for new converts, the Brothers show initiates the \"true way\" by forcing them to consume a mind-altering elixir that induces vivid hallucinations that they believe \"free their minds\". The true intentions of the cult are unknown, save to the highest-ranking leader known only as the Shattered Sibling. The Broken Brothers seek to show all of Etharis that the old ways are the true way, and will use any means necessary to achieve this goal, even allying with primordial powers, spellcasters, or daemons from the Netherworlds. The town of Thorpes welcomes all children of the Divine, but only accepts those who prove themselves to be truly worthy.": "{@b {@i The Town of Thorpes}}--从表面上看，索普斯和卡斯蒂内拉省的其他虔诚的城镇一样。众多的寺庙和路边的神龛收集了对神圣的Seraphs的供奉，镇上还有一个规模不大的Arcanist Inquisition分会。但是，与任何宗教一样，并不是所有镇上的教徒都是自愿的追随者。在夜幕的掩护下，在隐蔽的建筑和滑道中，\"破碎兄弟 \"的邪教组织正在集结。他们是一个宗教组织，献身于Empyreus之前的方式--有人说甚至在诸神之前--可以通过他们的纹身来识别，纹身是用消失的墨水制作的，以避免宗教裁判所的审查。破碎兄弟会的成员从农民到低级别的神职人员和贵族都有。兄弟会一直在寻找新的皈依者，他们向入会者展示 \"真正的方法\"，强迫他们服用一种改变心智的灵药，诱发生动的幻觉，他们认为这样可以 \"解放他们的思想\"。该邪教的真正意图不为人知，只有被称为 \"破碎兄弟姐妹 \"的最高领导人知道。破碎兄弟试图向所有伊萨利斯人表明，旧的方式才是真正的方式，并将使用任何必要的手段来实现这一目标，甚至与原始的力量、施法者或来自阴间的守护神结盟。索普斯镇欢迎所有神性的孩子，但只接受那些证明自己真正有价值的人。",
	"{@b {@i Thaumaturge and the Fiendish Mask}} - The Thaumaturge, the Grand Thaumatic Order of Theurgists, is by its nature the greatest opponent of the Castinellan theocracy. They paid little attention to this emerging threat at the start, thinking such fanatical zealotry would simply self-destruct. But when it became obvious that there was no serious opposition to the rise of the Emptyreus theorcracy, and their hard-line attitude against spellcasters was sincere, the Thaumaturge sent its investigators to evaluate the threat.": "{@b {@i Thaumaturge and the Fiendish Mask}}--Thaumaturge，即大Thaumatic Theurgists骑士团，就其性质而言，是卡斯蒂内尔神权的最大对手。他们一开始对这个新出现的威胁并不重视，认为这种狂热的狂热主义会简单地自我毁灭。但是，当很明显地发现没有人认真反对空想家理论体系的崛起，而且他们对施法者的强硬态度是真诚的时候，Thaumaturge派出调查员来评估这个威胁。",
	"No one exactly knows what the Thaumaturge is up to, but the most imaginative rumour is that an expert illusionist wizard has infiltrated the Castinellan Provinces, taking the appearance of clergy members to give contradictory orders and cause confusion. Rumours grew from there- there had been an escape from the Arcanist Inquisition Headquarters; the headquarters had been infiltrated; it was all the doing of a mysterious wizard known as the Fiendish Mask. Taking the rumours seriously, the Inquisition offered an incredibly high reward for his capture. That is also the moment when immolation became the immediate punishment for almost all suspects of magical impurity...": "没有人确切地知道Thaumaturge在做什么，但最有想象力的传言是，一个擅长幻术的巫师潜入了卡斯蒂内兰省，借着神职人员的外表，发出矛盾的命令，造成混乱。谣言由此而生--有一个人从阿卡尼亚宗教裁判所总部逃跑了；总部被渗透了；这都是一个被称为恶魔面具的神秘巫师所为。宗教裁判所认真对待这些传言，为捕获他提供了令人难以置信的高额奖励。也是在那个时候，焚烧成为对几乎所有魔法不纯的嫌疑人的直接惩罚......",
	"In the centre of an immese lagoon on the southern coast of the continent, the city-state of Morencia occupies a central place between the Charneault Kingdom and the Castinella Provinces.": "莫伦西亚城邦位于大陆南部海岸的一个巨大的泻湖中心，在查尼奥特王国和卡斯蒂内拉省之间占据着中心位置。",
	"Legend has it that the ancestors of the Morencian people fled south to escape the Bürach Empire's ethnic persecution, coming at last to a series of small, desolate islands in a large lagoon. To conceal their escape, the refugees devised the Mist Spell that conjured a dense, constant fog over the reefs and sandbanks around the islands. Since then, only those trained by Morencia's famous Guild of Navigators have been able to lead a ship through the Misty Reefs.": "传说莫伦西亚人的祖先为了躲避布拉克帝国的种族迫害而向南逃亡，最后来到了一个大泻湖中一系列荒凉的小岛上。为了掩盖他们的逃亡，难民们设计了迷雾咒语，在岛屿周围的礁石和沙岸上幻化出浓密而持续的雾气。从那时起，只有那些被莫伦西亚著名的航海家协会训练过的人，才能带领船只穿过迷雾珊瑚礁。",
	"Thanks to that protection, the city of Morencia quickly rose from the swampy islands. Ideally located between several major powers in Etharis, the young city-state focused on navigation and trade to establish dominance over commercial maritime routes.": "由于这种保护，莫伦西亚城迅速从沼泽的岛屿上崛起。这个年轻的城邦位于伊萨里斯的几个主要大国之间，地理位置优越，专注于航海和贸易，以建立对海上商业路线的主导地位。",
	"An affinity for navigation, combined with a rigorous and perfectionist mentality, allowed Morencia to develop the fastest and most reliable ships ever built. In time, the Morencians also revealed themselves to be risk-management experts, which further established Morencia's reputation as an inevitable trade hub.": "对航海的亲和力，加上严谨和完美主义的心态，使莫伦西亚能够发展出有史以来最快和最可靠的船只。随着时间的推移，莫伦西亚人也显示出他们是风险管理专家，这进一步确立了莫伦西亚作为一个不可避免的贸易中心的声誉。",
	"As a city relying on trade, Morencia welcomes many travellers, the majority being merchants. The city has devised a detailed and careful policy to efficiently manage the constant influx of foreigners. Merchants are welcomed but tightly monitored, and they are forced to stay in specific districts during the night. Citizenship is never granted to such merchants except in exceptional circumstances, and they are not allowed to reside in Morencia for too long. This forces constant incoming and outgoing flows of population that are a further boon to the Morencian economy.": "作为一个依赖贸易的城市，莫伦西亚欢迎许多旅行者，其中大多数是商人。该市制定了详细而谨慎的政策，以有效管理不断涌入的外国人。商人受到欢迎，但受到严格的监控，他们被迫在夜间停留在特定的区域。除非在特殊情况下，这些商人永远不会被授予公民身份，而且不允许他们在莫伦西亚居住太长时间。这迫使人口不断流入和流出，进一步促进了莫伦西亚的经济。",
	"But, while Morencia limits the influence of foreign merchants within its walls, Morencia's merchants are themselves a powerful force throughout Etharis. Morencia is the seat of the continent-spanning Augustine Trading Company, which works everywhere to bend the flow of gold and goods towards itself. Within Morencia, the Augustine Trading Company has worked to align other entities' interests with its own. It has absorbed Morencia's powerful Bankers Guild, and through them it has come to control the city's Supreme Council as well.": "但是，虽然莫伦西亚限制了外国商人在其城墙内的影响，但莫伦西亚的商人本身也是整个Etharis的强大力量。莫伦西亚是横跨大陆的奥古斯丁贸易公司的所在地，它到处努力使黄金和货物流向自己。在莫伦西亚，奥古斯丁贸易公司努力使其他实体的利益与自己的利益一致。它吸收了莫伦西亚强大的银行家协会，并通过他们控制了城市的最高委员会。",
	"The Castinellan Provinces have attempted to take control of Morencia on numerous occasions, using both force and subterfuge. Their most recent but unsuccessful attempt involved capturing a member of the Navigators Guild and forcing him to lead a Castinellan armada through the Misty Reefs. Only the cunning intervention of the Charneault Kingdom saved Morencia from annexation. Grand Shaman Aethorion, helped by a small group of elven shamans, was able to interact with the Mist Spell to bring the Charneault Kingdom's ships directly to the rear of the Castinellan armada.": "卡斯蒂内尔省曾多次试图控制莫伦西亚，既使用武力又使用诡计。他们最近一次但不成功的尝试是俘虏了航海家协会的一名成员，并强迫他带领一支卡斯蒂内尔舰队穿越迷雾珊瑚礁。只有查诺特王国的狡猾的干预才使莫伦西亚免于被吞并。大萨满Aethorion在一小群精灵萨满的帮助下，能够与迷雾法术互动，将查尔诺王国的船只直接带到卡斯蒂内尔舰队的后方。",
	"A terrible battle took place at Morencia's doorstep, and although the Castinellan armada managed to destroy a large portion of the Morencian fleet stationed in the Arsenal of Morencia, the Charneault Kingdom's ships and the remaining Morencian defence forces led by Admiral Endoria Onaglie managed to surround and overwhelm the attackers. Only a few Castinellan ships survived, though the defenders also suffered heavy losses.": "一场可怕的战斗发生在莫伦西亚的门口，尽管卡斯蒂内尔舰队成功地摧毁了驻扎在莫伦西亚兵工厂的一大部分莫伦西亚舰队，但查诺特王国的船只和由海军上将Endoria Onaglie领导的剩余莫伦西亚防御部队成功地包围并压倒了攻击者。只有几艘卡斯蒂内尔的战舰幸存下来，尽管防御者也遭受了重大损失。",
	"Since then, the Castinella Provinces have yet to attempt another military conquest, but they have not given up their ambition of controlling Morencia. They have recently strengthened their connections with the Augustine Trading Company, which many Morencians see as the explanation for a series of underhanded moves by the Bankers Guild Master Kolhys.": "从那时起，卡斯蒂内拉省还没有尝试另一次军事征服，但他们没有放弃控制莫伦西亚的野心。他们最近加强了与奥古斯丁贸易公司的联系，许多莫伦西亚人认为这是对银行家协会会长科利斯一系列暗箱操作的解释。",
	"The truth is more complex, but many have noted that the Bankers Guild profited immensely in the aftermath of the Castinellan Provinces' attack. Backed by the Augustine Trading Company's coffers, the Bankers Guild offered a generous loan for the reconstruction of the Morencian fleet, but the offer was so generous that it aroused greater suspicion. Finally, Doge Lorenzo Flabenici was able to steer the Supreme Council on another course that would turn out to be even more dangerous. To raise the funds, the Supreme Council opened the way to the sale of its seats. This was supposed to allow any guild or other community to earn a place on the Supreme Council, but bids became so high that many had to arrange astronomical loans from the Bankers Guild to purchase their seat.": "真相更加复杂，但许多人都注意到，银行家协会在卡斯蒂内利亚省的攻击之后获得了巨大的利益。在奥古斯丁贸易公司国库的支持下，银行家协会为重建莫伦西亚舰队提供了一笔慷慨的贷款，但这个提议太过慷慨，引起了更大的怀疑。最后，总督洛伦佐-弗拉贝尼奇（Lorenzo Flabenici）得以将最高委员会引向另一条路线，而这条路线会变得更加危险。为了筹集资金，最高委员会开放了出售其席位的途径。这本来是为了让任何公会或其他社区都能在最高委员会中获得一席之地，但竞价变得如此之高，以至于许多人不得不从银行家协会安排天文数字的贷款来购买他们的席位。",
	"Moreover, the Bankers Guild itself was able to buy the biggest share of the available seats. In addition to empowering the Bankers Guild, this sequence of events considerably weakened the position of the Doge.": "此外，银行家协会本身能够购买最大份额的可用席位。除了赋予银行家协会权力之外，这一系列事件还大大削弱了总督的地位。",
	"The nights have become far more dangerous in recent months, with people being found dead in the streets and canals of Morencia. Rumours are swirling that monsters have appeared to punish the sinful, but so far none really know what the cause of these attacks are. However, the modus operandi is extremely barbaric and strangely similar, almost ritual. The creature-or whatever it is-always attacks when the moon is not visible, either absent or masked by clouds. Increasing night patrols has had no effect, so as a last resort, the Supreme Council has hired the famous witch hunter, Vedemir Kaltstahl, to investigate.": "近几个月来，夜晚变得更加危险，人们被发现死在莫伦西亚的街道和运河里。有传言说，怪物的出现是为了惩罚有罪的人，但到目前为止，没有人真正知道这些攻击的原因是什么。然而，其作案手法极其野蛮，而且奇怪地相似，几乎是仪式性的。这种生物--或者不管它是什么--总是在月亮不可见的时候攻击，要么不存在，要么被云层遮挡。增加夜间巡逻没有任何效果，所以作为最后的手段，最高委员会聘请了著名的女巫猎人韦德米尔-卡尔特斯塔尔来调查。",
	"Held once per year in the heart of summer, the Black Carnival is an occasion for Morencians to give free rein to their base instincts. Clothed in extravagant costumes, the citizens feast for an entire month, indulging in incredible amounts on food, beverages, and more licentious activities. But recent years have seen the carnival tarnished, as darker habits have begun to spread among the population. Rumours tell of debauched gatherings hosted by dark sorcerers, where torture is conducted in exchange for massive amounts of gold. Even if no such activities have been exposed so far, the level of debauchery has clearly increased, with the most critical voices already associating this deviancy with the new threat, the Dread of the Moonless Night.": "黑色狂欢节每年在夏季的中心举行一次，是莫伦西亚人自由发挥其基本本能的机会。市民们身着奢华的服装，在一整个月内大吃大喝，在食物、饮料和更多放荡的活动上沉迷不已。但最近几年，狂欢节被玷污了，因为黑暗的习惯开始在人口中蔓延。有传言说黑暗巫师举办的放荡聚会，在那里用酷刑来换取大量的黄金。即使到目前为止还没有这种活动被曝光，但放荡的程度显然已经增加了，最关键的声音已经将这种堕落与新的威胁--无月之夜的恐惧联系起来。",
	"At the end of the year, six months after the Black Carnival, Morencia is usually covered in snow. This is the signal for a very different kind of carnival: a chance to clean all the refuse from the city, be it rubbish or people.": "在年底，即黑色狂欢节的六个月后，莫伦西亚通常被雪覆盖。这是一个非常不同的狂欢节的信号：一个清理城市所有垃圾的机会，无论是垃圾还是人。",
	"The official white mask worn during the White Carnival is reserved for citizens, and anyone unable to get a mask-by legal means or otherwise-is pursued, placed in a skiff, and exiled across the lagoon.": "白色狂欢节期间佩戴的官方白色面具是为公民保留的，任何无法通过合法手段或其他方式获得面具的人都会被追捕，被放在小艇上，并被放逐到泻湖对面。",
	"{@b {@i The Misty Reefs}} - Foolish sailors attempting to cross the Misty Reefs without the help of a Morencian guild navigator usually wander for days in the mist, only to end up at their starting point-if they aren't wrecked on the treacherous reefs or run aground on a sandbank, that is. Tales of this magical, misty maze speak of moving sandbanks that make any traditional mapping pointless. How the members of the Navigators Guild find their way is one of the mysteries that feeds Morencia's reputation.": "{@b {@i The Misty Reefs}}--愚蠢的水手们试图在没有莫伦西亚公会领航员的帮助下穿越迷雾暗礁，通常会在迷雾中徘徊数日，最后才会回到出发点--如果他们没有在险恶的暗礁上失事或在沙岸上搁浅的话。关于这个神奇、迷雾重重的迷宫的传说中，移动的沙岸使任何传统的地图都变得毫无意义。航海家协会的成员是如何找到他们的路的，这也是莫伦西亚的声誉的一个奥秘。",
	"{@b {@i The Arsenal of Morencia}} - A marvellous demonstration of Morencia's might, the Arsenal of Morencia serves as an example for other naval powers in Etharis. It occupies the main entrance to the city and serves as a filter for incoming vessels. The first part is a quarantine zone where crews and merchandise are stationed for forty days before being permitted inside Morencia. The second part shelters the arsenal itself, with the Morencian ships and shipyards.": "{@b {@i The Arsenal of Morencia}}--莫伦西亚的军火库是莫伦西亚实力的完美展现，它为伊萨里斯的其他海军强国树立了榜样。它占据了城市的主要入口，并对进入的船只起到了过滤作用。第一部分是一个隔离区，船员和商品在被允许进入莫伦西亚之前要在这里驻扎40天。第二部分是兵工厂本身，包括莫伦西亚的船只和船厂。",
	"{@b {@i The Water Strider Bridge}} - An astonishing piece of architecture takes centre stage in the heart of the canal network of Morencia. Originally a single bridge built above the main canal, it was the site of many trade activities. As a consequence, it was later linked to the surrounding islands by secondary bridges as the city grew larger. It finally became an improbable assembly of four bridges linked to a main bridge, vaguely in the form of a gigantic water strider-hence the name.": "{@b {@i The Water Strider Bridge}} - 在莫伦西亚运河网络的中心地带，一个令人惊讶的建筑作品占据了中心位置。它最初是一座建在主运河上的单桥，是许多贸易活动的场所。因此，随着城市的扩大，它后来被二级桥连接到周围的岛屿上。最后，它变成了一个由四座桥组成的不可能的组合，与一座主桥相连，依稀是一个巨大的水黾的形式--因此而得名。",
	"Doge Lorenzo Flabenici - Elected for a lifetime mandate, the Doge is the official representative and-supposedly-most influential person in Morencia. The election is a long process that usually lasts an entire week or more. Flabenici's election took a moderate ten days, a duration that should have been an omen of a stable and seamless governance, but many events have disturbed the course of Morencia during his mandate. Although Doge Lorenzo was not directly responsible for the Castinellan conflict or the re cent degeneracy of the Black Carnival, his reputa tion has suffered from both blows to Morencia's honor. Further, his calamitous move to bail out the city's coffers by selling seats on the Supreme Council have sealed his disapproval by the people. He is now in a delicate political position, forced to constantly renegotiate with his fellow nobles and the guilds.": "总督洛伦佐-弗拉贝尼奇（Lorenzo Flabenici）--当选为终身职务，是莫伦西亚的官方代表和--据说是最有影响力的人。选举是一个漫长的过程，通常会持续一整个星期或更长时间。弗拉贝尼奇的选举只用了十天的时间，这个时间应该是稳定和无缝治理的预兆，但在他的任期内，许多事件扰乱了莫伦西亚的进程。尽管洛伦佐总督对卡斯蒂内利亚冲突和黑色狂欢节的堕落没有直接责任，但他的声誉却因这两件事而受到打击，莫伦西亚的荣誉也因此受到影响。此外，他通过出售最高委员会的席位来拯救城市国库的灾难性举动，使他不被人民所接受。他现在处于一个微妙的政治地位，被迫不断地与他的贵族伙伴和行会重新谈判。",
	"Witch Hunter Vedemir Kaltstahl - With a long record including the famous capture and execution of the Three Sisters, a band of sorceresses that terrorised the Bürach Empire for many years, Witch Hunter Vedemir Kaltstahl has nothing left to prove.": "女巫猎人维德米尔-卡尔特斯塔尔（Vedemir Kaltstahl）--有一个长期的记录，包括著名的捕获和处决三姐妹，一个多年来恐吓比拉赫帝国的女巫团伙，女巫猎人维德米尔-卡尔特斯塔尔已经没有什么可证明的了。",
	"It is no surprise that he was chosen by the Supreme Council to investigate the mysterious series of murders referred to as the Dread of the Moonless Night. His investigation has only started recently though, and there is no sign of progress yet, other than his sudden demand to individually interrogate every member of the Supreme Council. Knowing his extreme interrogation techniques, it is understandable that some council members have tried to wriggle out of questioning, even though it brings suspicion on them.": "他被最高委员会选中调查被称为 \"无月之夜的恐惧 \"的神秘系列谋杀案，这并不奇怪。不过他的调查最近才开始，除了他突然要求单独审问最高委员会的每个成员外，还没有任何进展的迹象。由于知道他的极端审讯技术，可以理解一些理事会成员试图摆脱审讯，尽管这使他们受到怀疑。",
	"Admiral Endoria Onaglie, Master of the Navigators Guild - Born into one of the oldest and most renowned noble families of Morencia, Endoria Onaglie nonetheless earned his rank of Guild Master through his numerous deeds during his already long career. But this fifty-year-old, seasoned captain has lost none of his power, save for an eye. Admiral Onaglie was in charge of the Morencian fleet when the Castinella Provinces managed to strike Morencia by sur prise. Only his experience and intuition allowed ships to be deployed from the Arsenal quickly enough to avoid the complete destruction of the Morencian fleet. He then led the remaining ships against the Castinellans, losing his eye during the final assault on the enemy flagship.": "海军上将Endoria Onaglie，航海家协会会长--Endoria Onaglie出生于莫伦西亚最古老和最著名的贵族家庭之一，但他还是通过在他已经很长的职业生涯中的无数事迹赢得了他的协会会长地位。但是这位五十岁的老练的船长除了一只眼睛之外，没有失去任何力量。当卡斯蒂内拉省成功地以突袭的方式打击莫伦西亚时，奥纳格利上将负责指挥莫伦西亚的舰队。只有他的经验和直觉才允许从兵工厂快速部署船只，以避免莫伦西亚舰队被完全摧毁。然后他带领剩余的战舰对抗卡斯蒂内拉人，在对敌方旗舰的最后攻击中失去了眼睛。",
	"Kolyhs \"The Blazing Brain\", Master of the Bankers Guild and Augustine Trading Company - Some consider the Blazing Brain the most powerful personality in Morencia. Many tales surround this mysterious character, try to explain his meteoric rise to power in Morencia's two most powerful mercantile organizations. His origins are another mystery that fuels both fascination and distrust among the Morencians. Whatever the truth may be, he is a man with considerable power thanks to the immense fortune the Bankers Guild sits on. First commanding the Bankers Guild, he controversially allowed the Augustine Trading Company to buy a controlling portion of the Guild. Though dwarfed by the Augustine Trading Company, the Morencian Bankers Guild became the Company's single largest constituent, and Kolhys leveraged this position to rise through the Augustine Trad ing Company's ranks until he commanded both organizations. Kolhys was the very first banker to obtain a seat on Morencia's Supreme Council, which immediately provoked controversy. More over, he has been accused numerous times of corrupting other council members, but has never been convicted, as his accusers always either suddenly withdrew their complaints or disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Many believe that now the Bankers Guild, the Augustine Trading Company, and the Morencian Supreme Council are effectively the same entity. If that's true, they have Kolhys to thank-or curse-for it.": "Kolyhs \"The Blazing Brain\"，银行家协会和奥古斯丁贸易公司的负责人--有人认为Blazing Brain是莫伦西亚最强大的人物。许多故事围绕着这个神秘的人物，试图解释他在莫伦西亚两个最强大的商业组织中迅速崛起的原因。他的身世是另一个谜，在莫伦西亚人中引起了迷恋和不信任。无论真相如何，由于银行家协会坐拥的巨大财富，他是一个拥有相当大权力的人。第一次指挥银行家协会时，他有争议地允许奥古斯丁贸易公司购买协会的控制性部分。虽然与奥古斯丁贸易公司相比相形见绌，但莫伦西亚银行家协会成为该公司最大的单一成员，科利斯利用这一地位在奥古斯丁贸易公司的队伍中不断上升，直到他指挥这两个组织。Kolhys是第一个在莫伦西亚最高委员会获得席位的银行家，这立即引起了争议。此外，他曾无数次被指控腐蚀其他理事会成员，但从未被定罪，因为他的指控者总是要么突然撤回他们的投诉，要么在神秘的情况下消失了。许多人认为，现在银行家协会、奥古斯丁贸易公司和莫伦西亚最高理事会实际上是同一个实体。如果这是真的，他们有科利斯要感谢或咒骂它。",
	"As the main political body in Morencia, the Supreme Council has the last word on every sensitive matter in Morencia's political and legal affairs. Historically open to nobles only, its seats are now available for sale, allowing the wealthiest guilds to hold seats and thus gain even more influence in Morencia. Especially in the case of the Bankers Guild, it has become difficult to see where Morencia's government ends and its business interests begin.": "作为莫伦西亚的主要政治机构，最高委员会对莫伦西亚的政治和法律事务中的每个敏感问题都有最后的决定权。它的席位历来只对贵族开放，现在可以出售，允许最富有的行会拥有席位，从而在莫伦西亚获得更大的影响力。特别是在银行家协会的情况下，已经很难看到莫伦西亚的政府在哪里结束，其商业利益在哪里开始。",
	"The oldest known organization created by the Morencians, the Carpenters Guild also bears one of the most critical responsibilities for Morencia's continued survival: the guild governs the city's shipwrights. The reputation of the ships produced by the Great Arsenal of Morencia has spread across all of Etharis, even as far as the northern Valikan isles. This reputation is well earned: the carpenters undergo five years of harsh training under the supervision of a Master Carpenter, transforming them into essential assets for any substantial expedition requiring on-the-go ship maintenance. This affords them extremely high wages, though not quite reaching the levels of the navigators who safely lead the ships in and out of the Misty Reefs.": "作为莫伦西亚人创建的最古老的组织，木匠公会也承担着莫伦西亚持续生存的最关键的责任之一：该公会管理着城市的造船师们。莫伦西亚大兵工厂生产的船只的声誉已经传遍了整个伊萨利斯，甚至远至北部的瓦利坎岛。这种声誉是有目共睹的：木匠们在木匠大师的监督下接受了五年的严酷训练，使他们成为任何需要随时维修船只的大型探险队的重要资产。这为他们提供了极高的工资，尽管还没有达到安全带领船只进出迷雾礁的航海家的水平。",
	"The Navigators Guild holds the secrets of sailing in and out of the Misty Reefs. Such secrets are jealously guarded, as Morencia's independence mostly relies on the protection provided by the Misty Reefs. In the last decade, however, since the seats on the Supreme Council were opened for sale, the navigators' prices have risen frequently and sharply. The most vehement critics accuse the Navigators Guild of outright robbery, gouging to afford more seats on the council and thus more power. But more worrying rumours speak of the Mist Spell becoming harder to control and its effects more pronounced, increasing the difficulty of navigating the Misty Reefs.": "航海家协会掌握着驶入和驶出迷雾暗礁的秘密。这些秘密被严加保护，因为莫伦西亚的独立主要依靠迷雾珊瑚礁提供的保护。然而，在过去的十年里，自从最高委员会的席位开放出售以来，航海家的价格经常大幅上涨。最激烈的批评者指责航海家协会是赤裸裸的抢劫，通过敲诈来获得理事会更多的席位，从而获得更多的权力。但更令人担忧的是，有传言说迷雾法术变得更难控制，其影响也更明显，增加了在迷雾暗礁上航行的难度。",
	"The Bankers Guild is probably the most influential of the guilds, as they are the only ones authorised to loan money. They of course use this privilege to lend to other Morencian guilds, but also loan money to agents outside the city. Since its absorption by the Augustine Trading Company, the guild has become intertwined with commerce on a global scale. Moreover, it is commonly known that their biggest clients are the Castinella Provinces, which fuels suspicion as to their true allegiances.": "银行家公会可能是最有影响力的公会，因为他们是唯一被授权贷款的公会。当然，他们利用这一特权向其他莫伦西亚行会贷款，但也向城外的代理商贷款。自从被奥古斯丁贸易公司吸收后，该行会已经与全球范围内的商业交织在一起。此外，众所周知，他们最大的客户是卡斯蒂内拉省，这加剧了人们对其真实忠诚度的怀疑。",
	"Nested in the Wide Gulf called bite bay north of the Charneault Kingdom, the citystate of Liesech deploys its dense web of channels and ditches in a constant fight against the sea.

On the west side, a giant harbour and arsenal face the sea.": "Liesech城邦坐落在Charneault王国北部被称为bite海湾的宽阔海湾，它部署了密密麻麻的渠道和沟渠网络，不断地与大海作斗争。在城市的东边，一个依靠水的令人印象深刻的防御系统曾经保护了城市，抵御了比拉赫帝国的野心。在西侧，一个巨大的港口和兵工厂面向大海。",
	"The Bouwengracht family has tacitly reigned in Liesech since its very beginning as a city-state. Back when Liesech was just a large fishing village, Otto Bouwengracht was an ambitious fisherman who direly desired a better, wealthier life. His ambition led him to fish further out in the bay. When he eventually reached the area at the centre of the bay, known as the Eye of the Sea, he came upon an otherworldly creature called the Filth Grazer. The creature felt the fisherman's ambition and offered him a bargain; she promised advice and access to superior intelligence that would help Bouwengracht raise a superb coastal city, the most wealthy ever known. In exchange, what she asked seemed very little in the eyes of Otto Bouwengracht: the filth of the city.": "自从利塞克成为城邦之初，布文格拉西家族就默默地统治着它。当Liesech只是一个大渔村时，奥托-布文格拉特是一个雄心勃勃的渔民，他迫切希望过上更好、更富裕的生活。他的雄心壮志使他在海湾的更远处捕鱼。当他最终到达海湾中心的区域，被称为 \"海之眼 \"时，他遇到了一个超凡脱俗的生物，被称为 \"污秽侵蚀者\"。这个生物感受到了渔夫的野心，并向他提出了一个交易；她承诺提供建议和获得高级情报的机会，以帮助布文格拉特建立一个一流的沿海城市，成为有史以来最富裕的城市。作为交换，她要求的东西在奥托-布文格拉西眼里似乎很少：城市的污物。",
	"She wanted to eat all the rubbish produced by the city, including the corpses of the dead. Otto Bouwengracht's part of the bargain was to instate a cult that would secretly serve the creature's gluttony under the guise of blessing the sea for all the wealth it provided to the city.": "她想吃掉城市产生的所有垃圾，包括死者的尸体。奥托-布文格拉希特的交易部分是建立一个邪教，在祝福海洋为城市提供的所有财富的幌子下，秘密地为这个生物的贪食服务。",
	"Otto Bouwengracht accepted. True to the creature's word, he quickly became a famous businessman whose wealth boosted the development of Liesech. He developed tremendously advanced techniques to expand the territory of Liesech, constructing channels and ditches that would prevent floods and optimise transport and logistics. Naval construction also accelerated, and under the Bouwengracht family's rule, Liesech became a major maritime power in only a few generations. They began sending more ships across the seas to explore and gather wealth, and after a few more generations, Liesech had reached a state of wealth and opulence that no one in Etharis could ignore.": "奥托-布文格拉特接受了。他果然不负众望，很快成为著名的商人，他的财富推动了Liesech的发展。他开发了极其先进的技术来扩大Liesech的领土，建造渠道和沟渠来防止洪水，优化运输和物流。海军建设也在加速，在布文格拉特家族的统治下，Liesech在短短几代人的时间里就成为一个主要的海上强国。他们开始派遣更多的船只出海探索和收集财富，又经过几代人的努力，Liesech已经达到了Etharis任何人都无法忽视的财富和富足状态。",
	"That was the moment when the Bürach Empire turned its imperial gaze on the small city. Liesech had become a major trade hub between the nearby regions of Etharis, especially the Bürach Empire and the Charneault Kingdom. These two powers benefited greatly from the improved trade routes, but the Bürach Empire couldn't bear the taxes applied on all the supplies that passed through Liesech's harbour. The Charneault Kingdom, on the other hand, favored Liesech's independence, fearing that an annexation would worsen their position.": "就在这时，比拉赫帝国将其帝国的目光转向了这座小城。Liesech已经成为Etharis附近地区的主要贸易枢纽，特别是Bürach帝国和Charneault王国。这两个大国从贸易路线的改善中受益匪浅，但布拉克帝国无法承受对通过利塞克港口的所有物资征收的税收。另一方面，夏尔诺王国赞成利塞克的独立，担心吞并会使他们的地位恶化。",
	"The Bürach Empire could not leave Liesech in peace, fearing their autonomy might inspire independence movements inside the empire. Leading Bürach aristocrats made a deal with the countess Analita von Raiza, a powerful vampire who was held captive in the Bürach Empire. In return for her freedom, she was to enter Liesech and use her vampiric powers to take control of the Bouwengracht family. Once done, she would open the city to the annexation. Knowing that most vampires crave to hold power over territory and a population, the Bürach aristocrats hoped this bargain would let them absorb Liesech's wealth while keeping Analita von Raiza under control. They were right, but not entirely.": "比拉赫帝国不能让Liesech安然无恙，担心他们的自治会激发帝国内部的独立运动。比拉赫的主要贵族与安娜莉塔-冯-拉伊扎伯爵夫人达成了协议，她是一个强大的吸血鬼，被囚禁在比拉赫帝国境内。作为自由的回报，她将进入利塞克，利用她的吸血鬼力量来控制布文格拉特家族。一旦完成，她将开放城市的吞并。由于知道大多数吸血鬼都渴望掌握对领土和人口的权力，布瓦赫贵族希望这个交易能让他们吸收利塞克的财富，同时控制住阿莱丽塔-冯-拉伊扎。他们是对的，但不完全是。",
	"Analita von Raiza was a higher vampire, allowing her to notice the magic in action around Liesech, and in particular the Bouwengracht family. It did not prevent her from fulfilling her mission, but shortly after the annexation-and once she understood where the strange magic around Bouwengracht family came from-she saw an opportunity to strike a blow against the Bürach Empire and spoil the jewel that she had so compliantly handed to her former gaoler.": "阿娜莉塔-冯-拉伊扎是一个高级吸血鬼，这使她能够注意到利塞克周围的魔法活动，特别是布文格拉特家族。这并不妨碍她完成她的任务，但在吞并后不久--一旦她明白了布文格拉特家族周围的奇怪魔法来自何处--她就看到了一个机会，可以对布拉克帝国进行打击，破坏她如此顺从地交给她以前的囚犯的珠宝。",
	"On the morning of the next annual ceremony of the Nurturing Sea, the entire Bouwengracht family was found slaughtered, their blood entirely drained out.": "在下一个养育之海年度仪式的早晨，人们发现布文格拉特家族全部被屠杀，他们的血液完全被吸干。",
	"The bargain between the Filth Grazer and Bouwengracht family was therefore broken, and Analita would not allow it to continue in any other form for she wanted to replace the creature's influence over the city with her own. But the ancient creature was cunning, and enacted revenge against both the Bouwengracht family and the vampire: it infected the corpses of the Bouwengracht with the virulent Weeping Pox. The Bouwengracht family was given a lavish funeral inside the Froth Church, the main church of Liesech, and the disease spread from there to devastating effect.": "因此，肮脏的格拉泽和布文格拉特家族之间的交易被打破了，阿娜莉塔不允许它以任何其他形式继续下去，因为她想用自己的影响力取代这个生物对城市的影响。但这个古老的生物很狡猾，它对布文格拉特家族和吸血鬼进行了报复：它让布文格拉特家族的尸体感染了剧烈的哭泣之痘。Bouwengracht家族在Liesech的主教堂Froth教堂内举行了豪华的葬礼，疾病从那里蔓延开来，产生了毁灭性的影响。",
	"Analita von Raiza had not expected the Filth Grazer to give the city up easily, but she was nevertheless furious to see her new flock die by the thousands. She was immune to the pox and powerful enough to challenge the creature. A terrible battle ensued. The fight lasted for an entire day and caused giant tides which wreaked havoc on the harbour. At the end of the day Analita von Raiza came back, exhausted but alive. None know for sure who won the encounter or if the Filth Grazer exists, but Analita has never returned to the Eye of the Sea. Instead she spends most of her days within her den atop the High Belfry, the highest building and main place of power in Liesech.": "阿娜莉塔-冯-拉伊扎没有想到污秽侵蚀者会轻易放弃这座城市，但看到她的新羊群成千上万地死去，她还是感到很愤怒。她对痘痘有免疫力，而且有足够的力量来挑战这个生物。一场可怕的战斗随之展开。这场战斗持续了整整一天，引起了巨大的潮汐，对港口造成了严重的破坏。一天结束时，阿娜莉塔-冯-拉伊扎回来了，虽然筋疲力尽，但还活着。没有人知道谁赢得了这场遭遇战，也没有人知道污秽者是否存在，但阿娜莉塔从未回到海之眼。相反，她大部分时间都呆在她位于高高的钟楼上的巢穴里，钟楼是Liesech的最高建筑，也是主要的权力场所。",
	"As the Weeping Pox spread quickly in the city, the Bürach Empire deployed troops outside to place Liesech under quarantine. However, it was too late, as they learned later that the disease had already spread outside Liesech.": "由于哭泣之痘在该市迅速蔓延，布拉克帝国在外面部署了军队，将Liesech置于隔离状态。然而，这已经太晚了，因为他们后来得知，疾病已经在利塞克城外蔓延。",
	"The symptoms of the Weeping Pox are both an eloquent manifestation of the Filth Grazer's devious mind and a metaphor for Liesech's course in history. At first a sick person will be subject to fever causing sharpened senses, overexcitement, and a sense of wellbeing. But soon these symptoms will transition to delirium, burning fever, insatiable thirst, and weltering lesions that have given the illness its name. Beyond this, nearly all who contract the disease die shortly after. Most people succumb to the pox in a few days while the most resilient may hold on for almost two weeks.": "哭泣之痘的症状既是污秽侵蚀者狡猾心智的雄辩表现，也是对Liesech历史进程的隐喻。起初，病人会因发烧而导致感官敏锐，过度兴奋，并有一种幸福感。但很快这些症状就会过渡到谵妄、灼热、贪得无厌的口渴，以及为这种疾病命名的井喷式病变。除此之外，几乎所有感染该病的人都会在不久之后死亡。大多数人在几天内就会屈服于水痘，而最顽强的人可能会坚持将近两个星期。",
	"Once per year, the people of Liesech would gather at the harbour for a great celebration dedicated to the sea and the great wealth it provided to the city. The aristocrats and especially the Bouwengracht family would place many offerings on boats and send them out on the water. The event was only held if there was a good wind coming from the land, to push the offerings towards the centre of the bay.": "每年一次，利塞克人都会聚集在港口，举行盛大的庆祝活动，献给大海和它给城市带来的巨大财富。贵族们，特别是Bouwengracht家族会在船上放置许多祭品，并把它们送上水面。这个活动只有在有来自陆地的好风时才会举行，以便将祭品推向海湾的中心。",
	"Although one would expect at least some of the ships to wash up somewhere in the bay, none were ever retrieved.": "虽然人们期望至少有一些船只会被冲到海湾的某个地方，但没有一艘被打捞上来。",
	"Moreover, the ceremony was always followed by strange currents in the bay, and the harbour would stay closed for the entire day after the ceremony. In fact, the offerings were all for the benefit of the Filth Grazer. It is said this ceremony still takes place within the damned city of Liesech, driven by the insidious remnants of the Cult of the Sea.": "此外，仪式结束后，海湾中总是出现奇怪的气流，仪式结束后，港口会整日关闭。事实上，这些祭品都是为了污秽者的利益。据说这个仪式仍然在被诅咒的利塞克城内举行，由阴险的海神教残余分子驱动。",
	"A major event that used to be held on a yearly basis was the week of the Grand Citywide Market. On this occasion, the whole city would be transformed into a vast, open-air market lasting for an entire week. The variety and the quality of the available products and merchandise were simply unequalled in Etharis, even by the city-state of Morencia. These days are likely gone forever now that the Weeping Pox has devastated Liesech. If the market persists at all in the disease-stricken city, it is doubtlessly in a debased and corrupted form.": "过去每年都会举行的一个重大活动是全城大市场周。在这个时候，整个城市会变成一个巨大的露天市场，持续整整一个星期。所提供的产品和商品的种类和质量在伊萨里斯简直是无与伦比的，即使是莫伦西亚城邦也是如此。现在这些日子很可能永远消失了，因为哭泣之痘已经摧毁了Liesech。如果市场在这个受疾病困扰的城市中仍然存在，它无疑是以一种被贬低和腐蚀的形式存在。",
	"{@b {@i The Eye of the Sea}} - The centre of Bite Bay has been mostly impassable to ships from time immemorial. In taverns, they tell stories of mermaids or other mystical sea creatures that repel human boats and capture any trespassers. The awful truth of the Filth Grazer is known by a few people only, including the late Bouwengracht family and the vampire Countess Analita von Raiza.": "{@b {@i The Eye of the Sea}}--自古以来，比特湾的中心地带对船只来说大多是无法通行的。在酒馆里，人们讲述着美人鱼或其他神秘的海洋生物的故事，它们驱赶着人类的船只，捕获任何闯入者。肮脏的格雷泽的可怕真相只有少数人知道，包括已故的布文格拉特家族和吸血鬼伯爵夫人阿莱丽塔-冯-雷扎。",
	"{@b {@i The High Belfry}} - At the centre of Liesech is a huge square that once served as a public forum for popular debates, while the decisions about Liesech's politics and laws were made in the tall bell tower that overlooked the square. The High Belfry was constructed centuries ago by one of the first Bouwengracht governors, and this major place of power remained under their control until the Red Morning. The centre of the city is now ruled by the Cult of the Black Lady, and rumours say that Analita von Raiza takes her regenerating sleep on the highest floor of the High Belfry.": "{@b {@i The High Belfry}}--利塞克的中心是一个巨大的广场，曾经是民众辩论的公共论坛，而关于利塞克的政治和法律的决定则是在俯瞰广场的高大钟楼上做出的。高大的钟楼是几个世纪前由最早的布文格拉特总督之一建造的，这个主要的权力场所一直在他们的控制之下，直到红色早晨。城市的中心现在由黑衣女教统治，有传言说阿娜莉塔-冯-拉伊扎在高钟楼的最高层进行再生睡眠。",
	"{@b {@i The Froth Church}} - The Bouwengracht family initiated and financed the Cult of the Sea, a religious movement that revered the \"Nurturing Sea\" and made offerings in its name, in order to feed the Filth Grazer. Many churches were constructed for the cult in Liesech, but the most important is the Froth Church, the place where every Bouwengracht family member used to be buried. Built on the city's westernmost quay, the Froth Church is in direct contact with the sea. A small channel was set up to allow passage to the waters of the bay—and to allow the secret delivery of morbid offerings to the Filth Grazer. Because of that foul visitor, the sea around the church always foams and froths, hence its name.": "{@b {@i The Froth Church}}--Bouwengracht家族发起并资助了 \"海之崇拜\"，这是一个崇尚 \"养育之海 \"的宗教运动，并以它的名义进行供奉，以养活污秽的格拉泽。利塞克为该邪教建造了许多教堂，但最重要的是弗罗斯教堂，这里曾经埋葬了每一个布文格拉特家族成员。弗洛特教堂建在城市最西边的码头上，直接与大海接触。一个小通道被建立起来，以允许通过海湾的水域--并允许秘密地将病态的祭品送到肮脏的格拉泽。由于那个肮脏的访客，教堂周围的海面总是泛着泡沫，因此它的名字也是如此。",
	"{@b {@i Bouwergracht Family}} - The Bouwengracht family has enjoyed a reputation both mysterious and prestigious since the rise of Liesech. Otto Bouwengracht, the first known patriarch of the family, is the most famous. But the family is now fading slowly into oblivion after being slaughtered by Analita von Raiza during the event known as the Red Morning. However, rumour has it that one child of the family, Wilhelm, secretly escaped by being exchanged with another child at the last moment. The most fanciful stories claim he will come back one day to retake control of Liesech and return the city to its former glory.": "{@b {@i Bouwergracht Family}}--自利塞克崛起以来，布文格拉特家族一直享有既神秘又著名的声誉。奥托-布文格拉希特（Otto Bouwengracht）是该家族第一个已知的族长，也是最著名的。但在被称为 \"红色早晨 \"的事件中被阿娜莉塔-冯-拉伊扎屠杀后，该家族现在正慢慢淡出人们视线。然而，有传言说，该家族的一个孩子，威廉，在最后时刻通过与另一个孩子交换而秘密逃脱。最富想象力的故事声称他有一天会回来，重新控制利塞克，让城市恢复昔日的辉煌。",
	"{@b {@i The Filth Grazer}} - Even the few who know the existence of the Filth Grazer have no detailed understanding of it. This is no surprise, as such creatures are very rare and hardly intelligible to lesser beings such as humans. All that can be said for sure about it is that it possesses an inextinguishable thirst for the filth from human activities. There are stories about its actual appearance, some of which describe tentacles and rumbling supernatural voices, but they can be no more than rumours as no one comes back from the Eye of the Sea where the beast resides, feasting on rotting corpses and filth.": "{@b {@i The Filth Grazer}}--即使是少数知道 \"污秽侵蚀者 \"存在的人也没有详细了解它。这并不奇怪，因为这种生物非常罕见，而且对于人类这样的低等生物来说，几乎无法理解。关于它，可以肯定的是，它对人类活动中的污秽物有着无止境的渴求。关于它的真实面貌有一些故事，其中一些描述了触手和隆隆的超自然声音，但它们只能是谣言，因为没有人从海之眼回来，野兽居住在那里，以腐烂的尸体和污物为食。",
	"{@b {@i Vampire Countess Analita Von Raiza}} - Countess Analita von Raiza is probably is one of the oldest known vampires. Captured centuries ago during an old war between ancient Bürach tribes, she was held captive in a sophisticated magical sarcophagus whose makers have been long forgotten. As a higher vampire, she is almost impossible to kill as she is resistant to wounds that would slay a mortal. But this does not mean she is invincible, as she barely survived her encounter with the Filth Grazer. She now lies regenerating in the High Belfry, waiting for the Weeping Pox to pass before she emerges as the unchallenged ruler of Liesech.": "{@b {@i Vampire Countess Analita Von Raiza}}--安娜莉塔-冯-雷扎伯爵夫人可能是已知最古老的吸血鬼之一。几个世纪前，她在古老的布拉克部落之间的战争中被俘，被关在一个复杂的魔法石棺中，石棺的制造者早已被遗忘。作为一个高级吸血鬼，她几乎不可能被杀死，因为她对可以杀死凡人的伤口有抵抗力。但这并不意味着她是无敌的，因为她在与污秽侵蚀者的遭遇中勉强活了下来。她现在躺在高高的钟楼里再生，等待着哭泣之痘的到来，然后她将成为Liesech的无敌统治者。",
	"The Morbus Doctore appeared shortly after the release of the Weeping Pox. Wearing strange coats and masks meant to protect them from the disease, they wander the city looking for newly infected people. But only a fool would submit to their treatments, as they are known to conduct unbearable experiments on their \"patients\". They seem to be convinced that the Weeping Pox actually is a blessing that must be studied, exploited, and controlled to bring humanity forward to a new level of existence. Listening ears have heard them speak of \"the Great One from the Bay\" in reverential and fascinated terms.": "Morbus Doctore出现在哭泣之痘发布后不久。他们穿着奇怪的大衣，戴着面具，旨在保护他们免受疾病的侵害，他们在城市中游荡，寻找新的感染者。但只有傻瓜才会接受他们的治疗，因为众所周知，他们在 \"病人 \"身上进行难以忍受的实验。他们似乎相信，哭泣之痘实际上是一种祝福，必须加以研究、利用和控制，以使人类前进到一个新的生存水平。倾听者曾听到他们以崇敬和着迷的语气谈论 \"来自海湾的伟大者\"。",
	"When the countess Analita von Raiza arrived in Liesech, she did not immediately take control of the Bouwengracht family. As the smart mind she is, she understood that the best way to reach the places of power in the city was to create a reputation. She therefore gathered attractive young individuals she transformed into vampires and started a business of luxury. Thanks to the timely disappearance of several rich clients, her business grew rapidly and allowed her to constitute a small army of perverted but devoted followers. These fanatics now bear the name of the Cult of the Black Lady and control the centre area of Liesech to protect their mistress's den in the High Belfry. It is also said that they hunt for non infected people to steal their blood and serve it to the vampire countess while she is regenerating after her fight against the Filth Grazer.": "当安娜丽塔-冯-拉伊扎伯爵夫人来到利塞克时，她并没有立即控制布文格拉特家族。作为她的聪明头脑，她明白到达该市权力场所的最佳途径是创造声誉。因此，她聚集了有吸引力的年轻人，她把他们变成了吸血鬼，开始了奢侈品的生意。由于几个富有的客户的及时消失，她的生意迅速增长，并使她组成了一支由变态但忠实的追随者组成的小型军队。这些狂热者现在以 \"黑夫人崇拜 \"为名，控制着利塞克的中心区域，以保护他们的女主人在高级钟楼的巢穴。据说他们还猎杀未被感染的人，偷取他们的血液，并在吸血鬼伯爵夫人与污秽侵蚀者战斗后再生时提供给她。",
	"Regarded as the last remnant of Liesech's former glory, the G.B.C. are almost as ancient as the Bouwengracht family. They have one purpose, a duty they will carry out until the end whatever no matter happens, and that is the transportation of people and goods on the channels of Liesech. They are an honourable and devoted company whose members neither discriminate nor exploit their fellow man. They just ask the right price and nothing more for every course. But their exposure to every traveller in the city also makes them a highly valuable source of information for those who respect them and are ready to pay the extra coin.": "G.B.C.被认为是Liesech昔日辉煌的最后遗迹，他们几乎和Bouwengracht家族一样古老。他们只有一个目的，无论发生什么事，他们都会履行职责，直到最后，那就是在Liesech的渠道上运输人员和货物。他们是一家光荣而忠诚的公司，其成员既不歧视也不剥削他们的同伴。他们只是对每一个课程提出合适的价格，而不是其他。但是，对于那些尊重他们并愿意支付额外费用的人来说，他们在城市中接触到的每一个旅行者也使他们成为非常宝贵的信息来源。",
	"Wherever there is an ounce of power to be had, there is guaranteed to be a faction built around it.": "只要有一盎司的权力，就一定会有一个围绕它的派系。",
	"The major factions of Etharis have been around long enough to overtly or covertly permeate through every stratum of society. They have a presence in every nation and have a hand in nearly every major event in the history of the continent. They move with speed, intelligence, and ruthlessness. Thus these factions have endured throughout the centuries.": "Etharis的主要派别存在的时间足够长，公开或隐蔽地渗透到社会的每个阶层。他们在每个国家都有存在感，几乎在大陆历史上的每个重大事件中都有参与。他们以速度、智慧和无情的方式行动。因此，这些派别在几个世纪以来一直经久不衰。",
	"The Grand Thaumatic Order of Theurgists, or The Thaumaturge, is a loose confederation of archmages whose existence has been an open secret for several decades. The common folk regard them as a fairy tale, as The Thaumaturge spends much of its resources keeping their existence secret.": "炼金术士大团，或称Thaumaturge，是一个松散的大法师联盟，其存在几十年来一直是一个公开的秘密。普通人认为他们是一个童话，因为Thaumaturge花了很多资源来保密他们的存在。",
	"The Thaumaturge was created after the Beast first appeared in the Bürach Empire, and archmages from nearby nations put aside their differences to discuss the surge of abominations in the land. While they have yet to find a solution to the Beast, they had some success in containing the abominations it created. Since then, the order has met secretly to manage similar threats. They have defeated a number of demon lords and eldritch monsters, all outside of the public eye.": "Thaumaturge是在野兽首次出现在Bürach帝国之后创建的，附近国家的大法师们搁置了他们的分歧，讨论这片土地上激增的憎恶。虽然他们还没有找到解决野兽的办法，但他们在遏制野兽造成的憎恶方面取得了一些成功。从那时起，该组织就开始秘密开会，管理类似的威胁。他们已经击败了一些恶魔领主和长生怪物，都是在公众视线之外。",
	"The Thaumaturge aims to protect the entirety of Etharis from world-ending or even reality-ending scenarios. It succeeds largely because it operates in the shadows, free from the politics of their respective governments that may forbid them to act. They share resources and information whenever necessary in order to defeat a major foe.": "Thaumaturge的目标是保护整个Etharis不受世界末日甚至是现实末日的影响。它的成功主要是因为它在暗中运作，不受各自政府可能禁止他们行动的政治影响。他们在必要时分享资源和信息，以击败主要敌人。",
	"Current members of The Thaumaturge include the likes of Mina Taliesin, Lady of Masks; the Ravencourt Keeper; Martorius; Lord Duma Felsinger of Erlefurt; Razbat, Head Gaoler of Cold Iron Keep; Odis of Sarmar Academy; and Lord Volarius of Aloran. It is believed the archmages meet in a pocket dimension where their discussions can be held in the utmost privacy. Every Thaumaturge member has agreed to be placed under a powerful geas that keeps them from betraying each other's confidence.": "目前Thaumaturge的成员包括Mina Taliesin，面具女士；Ravencourt守护者；Martorius；Erlefurt的Duma Felsinger勋爵；Razbat，Cold Iron Keep的主管；Sarmar学院的Odis；和Aloran的Volarius勋爵。人们相信大法师们会在一个袖珍空间里会面，他们的讨论可以在最私密的地方进行。每位Thaumaturge成员都同意被置于一个强大的Geas之下，使他们不会背叛彼此的信任。",
	"However, because the faction is driven by personalities, there are times when The Thaumaturge fails to act. The order has no single leader and acts on a majority vote. If vested interests prevent a majority, they can block any group action on an issue, leaving the others to act on their own. Hence, far-reaching events like the undead horde of the City Below have gone unanswered, as the Ostoyan members oppose any intervention from outsiders.": "然而，由于该派别是由个性驱动的，所以有时Thaumaturge未能采取行动。该派别没有单一的领袖，而是以多数票的方式行事。如果既得利益者阻止了多数人，他们可以阻止任何关于某个问题的团体行动，让其他人自行行动。因此，影响深远的事件，如下面城市的亡灵部落，都没有得到回应，因为奥斯托扬的成员反对任何外来者的干预。",
	"If one needs a war won, a powerful monster removed, or a dirty job completed, the Company of Free Swords is the top mercenary group to call—assuming you have the coin. Despite the name, the company's services are far from free.": "如果一个人需要赢得一场战争，清除一个强大的怪物，或完成一项肮脏的工作，自由之剑公司是最重要的雇佣兵团体，如果你有硬币的话。尽管有这个名字，该公司的服务却远非免费。",
	"An ancient and elite mercenary company, the Free Swords have tipped the scales of war for many a nation. It has the distinction of slaying a demon lord, and considers defeating a dragon a slow business day. The company includes warriors, wizards, priests, druids, rogues, and spies among its ranks. It has a branch in nearly every corner of the continent.": "自由之剑是一个古老而精锐的雇佣兵公司，它曾为许多国家赢得了战争的天平。它有杀死一个恶魔领主的殊荣，并认为击败一条龙是一个缓慢的工作日。该公司的队伍中包括战士、巫师、牧师、德鲁伊、流氓和间谍。它几乎在大陆的每个角落都有分支机构。",
	"The Free Swords began as a military unit in the now-defunct nation of Falaris. Serving a tyrant king, conscript soldiers fought endless wars against neighboring kingdoms. After receiving orders to raze a village of hapless peasants, one Commander Darion Harkin finally declared he had had enough. His entire unit deserted and formed their own organisation. When the king tried to have Harkin killed, the commander turned the tables and assassinated him instead.": "自由之剑最初是现在已经不存在的法拉里斯国家的一个军事单位。为一个暴君国王服务，应征士兵与邻近的王国进行了无休止的战争。在接到摧毁一个由无助的农民组成的村庄的命令后，一位指挥官达里安-哈金终于宣布他受够了。他的整个部队开小差，组成了他们自己的组织。当国王试图杀死哈金时，指挥官反其道而行之，暗杀了他。",
	"Harkin laid the foundations of the Company of Free Swords, proclaiming his organization one that prioritises the welfare of the soldier, not the ruler.

	"Despite their mercenary ethics, the Free Swords maintain a code of honor—stay loyal to the company, be honest in your dealings, and take vengeance on those who betray you or your comrades. They live simple lives free of excess, spending most of their time honing their fighting skills. Disciplined, loyal, and fearless, the company is ready for any war, confident in their success.": "尽管他们有雇佣兵的职业道德，但自由之剑保持着一种荣誉准则--对公司忠诚，在交易中诚实，并对那些背叛你或你的战友进行报复。他们生活简单，没有多余的东西，大部分时间都在磨练他们的战斗技巧。纪律严明，忠心耿耿，无所畏惧，该公司已准备好应对任何战争，对他们的成功充满信心。",
	"The Free Swords have spread across Etharis, taking on jobs from all who can afford their price. In a century they had become the largest such organisation in the land. No king, merchant, or official would dare cross them or default in their pay. They know the Company of Free Swords will take its price, one way or another.": "自由之剑已经遍布Etharis，从所有能负担得起他们价格的人手中接过工作。在一个世纪里，他们已经成为这片土地上最大的此类组织。没有国王、商人或官员敢于与他们作对，或拖欠他们的报酬。他们知道自由之剑公司无论如何都会接受它的价格。",

After systematising predatory lending practices and enforcing them ruthlessly, the Augustine Trading Company ended up as the wealthiest faction in all of Etharis.

While this current venture is frowned upon by the clergy, governments have embraced such forward-thinking ideas with open arms.": "这也不是什么秘密，该公司已经进入了武器交易的新时代：培育怪物在战场上服务。他们的第一个成功项目涉及被称为Warbreed的狼人王族。有传言说，该公司目前正在试验长生变种人。虽然目前的这种冒险被神职人员所反对，但政府已经张开双臂接受了这种前瞻性的想法。",
	"It is said that beneath every unexplained success lies an undiscovered crime. If so, the crimes of the Ebon Syndicate's number beyond reckoning.": "据说，在每一个无法解释的成功下面都有一个未被发现的罪行。如果是这样的话，伊本集团的犯罪数量是无法计算的。",
	"In many respects, the Ebon Syndicate is the Augustine Trading Company's dark mirror-an organization with a finger in every major criminal trade. Assassination, slave trading, drug trafficking, theft, and the black market all fall within their ambit.": "在许多方面，伊本集团是奥古斯丁贸易公司的黑暗镜像--一个在每个主要犯罪交易中都有涉足的组织。暗杀、奴隶交易、毒品贩运、盗窃和黑市都属于他们的范围。",
	"The syndicate employs and controls thugs, beggars, thieves, professional killers, extortionists, and spies. Its Shadow Academy ensures these agents operate with the highest skill and efficiency.": "该集团雇用和控制暴徒、乞丐、小偷、职业杀手、勒索者和间谍。它的影子学院确保这些特工以最高的技能和效率运作。",
	"The Ebon Syndicate began with an Altenheim based bandit named Hiram Greyman. One night, after a battle with the city watch left his men dead and Hiram badly wounded, the bandit fled into a hedge maze. There, delirious from blood loss, he followed a hawk moth that led him through to safety. Since then, Greyman thought himself favored by the gods and used the hawk moth as his personal symbol. He rebuilt his gang and went on to establish the Syndicate, which over the centuries grew into the powerful shadow organization it is today.": "伊本集团始于一个名叫希拉姆-格雷曼（Hiram Greyman）的阿尔滕海姆强盗。一天晚上，在与城市守卫的战斗中，他的手下死了，希拉姆也受了重伤，这个强盗逃进了一个篱笆迷宫。在那里，他因失血过多而神志不清，跟着一只鹰蛾走了，那只鹰蛾把他带到了安全地带。从那时起，格里曼认为自己受到了众神的眷顾，并把鹰蛾作为他的个人象征。他重建了自己的帮派，并继续建立了辛迪加，经过几个世纪的发展，辛迪加已经成为今天这个强大的影子组织。",
	"After Greyman died, his name became a title that was passed on from one syndicate leader to the next. The current Greyman is Natalia Koscheii, who is infamous for her ability to escape the most meticulous assassination attempts.": "格雷曼死后，他的名字成为一个头衔，从一个集团领导人传到另一个集团领导人。现任格雷曼是纳塔利娅-科舍伊，她因能够躲过最缜密的暗杀企图而臭名昭著。",
	"The syndicate's presence is most felt in the largest and most prosperous cities of Etharis. All the smaller crime organisations bow to the syndicate. Freelancers receive one warning before their lives are shortened, and any group that tries to muscle into the syndicate's territory is treated without mercy.": "该集团的存在在Etharis最大和最繁荣的城市最有感觉。所有较小的犯罪组织都向该集团低头。自由职业者在他们的生命被缩短之前会收到一个警告，任何试图进入该集团领土的团体都会被毫不留情地对待。",
	"The syndicate maintains a tenuous peace with the other factions. Groups like the Watchers and the Augustine Trading Company are technically at war with them, but will often hire their services, as the syndicate's spy network outmatches any other.": "该集团与其他派别保持着脆弱的和平。像守望者和奥古斯丁贸易公司这样的团体在技术上与他们处于战争状态，但往往会雇用他们的服务，因为集团的间谍网络比任何其他的都要好。",
	"The syndicate's insignia, the hawk moth, is a nocturnal creature known for its swift flight and short lifespan. Similarly, the agents of the syndicate move quickly through darkness, taking what they want, with the full knowledge that life is short among fellow rogues.": "该集团的标志，鹰蛾，是一种夜间生物，以其迅速的飞行和短暂的寿命而闻名。同样地，该集团的代理人在黑暗中快速移动，拿走他们想要的东西，并充分认识到在流氓伙伴中生命是短暂的。",
	"After the loss of the gods, many of their good-aligned clerics rallied to the remaining Arch Seraphs in order to hold the fabric of their society together. Throwing their faith behind the Seraphs, the major churches reformed into a large organisation known as The Watchers of the Faithful. Composed of priests and paladins, the Watchers have dedicated themselves to preserving the old faiths in this new form.": "在失去诸神之后，许多与之结盟的神职人员团结在剩余的大蛇夫身边，以维持社会结构的稳定。各大教会将他们的信仰投向了Seraphs，并重组为一个大型组织，称为 \"忠实的守望者\"。守望者由牧师和圣骑士组成，他们致力于以新的形式保护旧的信仰。",
	"The Watchers are a comparatively young faction, but are highly organised and zealous in the pursuit of their goals. They follow what they call the Eternal Dogma: revere the Arch Seraphs, follow their laws as handed down by the High Priest, and destroy all that is unholy and evil in their sight—through any means necessary.": "守望者是一个相对年轻的派别，但他们有高度的组织性，并热衷于追求他们的目标。他们遵循所谓的 \"永恒的教条\"：崇敬大蛇神，遵循大祭司传下来的法律，并通过任何必要的手段，消灭他们眼中所有不神圣和邪恶的东西。",
	"The Watchers are composed of six sects, each one following their particular Arch Seraph. Each elects a High Priest to rule the sect, with the most populous sect having the greatest weight in votes. The current High Priest, Nola Cirdanal, is a follower of Empyreus. Her uncompromising stance has put the Watchers on the path to war against several factions that have fallen afoul of the Eternal Dogma.": "守望者由六个教派组成，每个教派都追随他们特定的大蛇神。每个教派选举一名大祭司来统治该教派，人口最多的教派拥有最大的投票权。现任大祭司诺拉-塞尔达纳尔（Nola Cirdanal）是恩皮瑞斯（Empyreus）的追随者。她毫不妥协的立场使守望者走上了与几个违反永恒教条的派别开战的道路。",
	"The Watchers have instigated various inquisitions across the continent in an effort to stamp out all that is, in Cirdanal's words, \"corrupt, heretical, iniquitous, or displeasing to the eyes of Heaven.\" They have pursued the Augustine Trading Company for its efforts at weaponising monsters, the Soma nobility for falling to vampirism, and the Valikan tribes for worshipping elementals. To the shock of those in power, their attacks have often found support among the citizens. Thousands flocked to the Watchers, with many going on pilgrimages to Castinella, and money continues to flow into the coffers of the Grand Temple.": "守望者在整个大陆煽动了各种审讯，以努力铲除所有的东西，用塞尔达纳尔的话说，\"腐败的、异端的、不公正的、或不为天堂所喜的\"。他们追捕奥古斯丁贸易公司，因为它努力将怪物武器化，追捕索玛贵族，因为他们堕入吸血鬼之列，追捕瓦里坎部落，因为他们崇拜元素。令当权者震惊的是，他们的攻击经常在公民中得到支持。成千上万的人涌向守望者，许多人去卡斯蒂内拉朝圣，金钱不断流入大寺院的库房。",
	"In ancient times, the many gods of etharis guided their people to prosperity and enlightenment. That all changed during the Aetheric War, where the gods took up arms against a host of cosmic horrors called the Aether Kindred. This conflict led to the loss of nearly the entire pantheon. Many believe that the gods fled this reality for safer realms. Some scholars claim the gods were consumed by the very horrors they sought to destroy.": "在古代，etharis的众多神灵引导他们的人民走向繁荣和启蒙。这一切在乙太战争期间发生了变化，众神拿起武器对抗一群被称为乙太同类的宇宙恐怖组织。这场冲突导致了几乎整个万神殿的损失。许多人认为，众神逃离了这个现实，去了更安全的领域。一些学者声称诸神被他们试图摧毁的恐怖所吞噬。",
	"Those gods that survived returned to rule Etharis.": "那些幸存下来的神灵回到了伊萨里斯的统治。",
	"With their balance disrupted, though, they could no longer exist at peace with one another. They made war among themselves over who should rule above the others. Thus, the last of the gods extinguished one another.": "然而，随着他们的平衡被打破，他们再也不能彼此和平共处了。他们为了争夺谁应该凌驾于其他诸神之上而相互开战。因此，最后的神灵们互相灭绝了。",
	"Etharis has been left a godless plane undergoing a prolonged dark age. All that remains of the once almighty pantheon are the lieutenants of these lost gods, Arch Seraphs and Daemons who have been left to their own devices. While they wield enormous power, these beings are far less than the gods they once served. Some still attempt to fulfill the functions of their lost masters. Others have opted to pursue their own agendas.": "Etharis是一个无神的星球，正在经历一个漫长的黑暗时代。曾经全能的万神殿只剩下这些失落的神的副手，大蛇夫和大魔王，他们被留在自己的装置中。虽然他们拥有巨大的力量，但这些生命远不如他们曾经服务的神明。一些人仍然试图履行他们失去的主人的职能。其他人则选择了追求他们自己的议程。",
	"With the loss of the goddess Aurelia, Miklas took on her role as best as she could. Unfortunately, as she does not have the power to act as the new goddess of protection, her aid can only come after the fact. She soothes the tormented, provides succor in times of distress, and gives deliverance from oppression. Prisoners, the sick, the poor, and the destitute all seek her favor, as do clerics who wish to ease the world's suffering.": "随着奥蕾莉亚女神的离去，米克拉斯尽其所能地承担了她的角色。不幸的是，由于她没有能力充当新的保护女神，她的援助只能在事后才出现。她抚慰受折磨的人，在困境中提供救助，并从压迫中给予解救。囚犯、病人、穷人和赤贫者都寻求她的帮助，那些希望减轻世界痛苦的教士也是如此。",
	"Miklas resembles a tall, golden haired human clothed in a radiant white robe, bearing a staff of elderwood whose leaves continually wither and grow back.": "米克拉斯像一个高大的、金色头发的人类，身穿光芒四射的白袍，手持接骨木杖，其叶子不断地枯萎又重新生长。",
	"The patron of good-aligned warriors, Empyreus seeks to push back the influence of the Arch Daemons and return Etharis to its Golden Age. His uncompromising nature differs from that of Maligant, his predecessor. He drives his followers to become zealots bent on cleansing the world of whatever they perceive as sources of corruption.": "作为正统战士的守护神，恩比鲁斯试图击退大魔王的影响，让伊萨利斯回到它的黄金时代。他不妥协的本质与他的前任马利根不同。他驱使他的追随者成为狂热者，一心想把他们认为是腐败源头的东西清洗掉。",

	"A former archivist of the knowledge god Typharia, Zabriel was one of those who abandoned the ideals of their god, to pursue her own agenda. Whereas Typharia was neutrally-aligned and sought knowledge for the sake of knowledge, Zabriel sought to weaponize knowledge and truth. She is the patron of scholars, truth-seekers, counterspies, and those who seek to bring down conspiracies and oppressive regimes. Those who follow her often gain flashes of inspiration that lead them to discover secrets.": "作为知识之神泰法利亚的前档案员，扎布瑞尔是那些放弃他们神的理想，追求她自己的议程的人之一。泰法利亚是中立的，为了知识而寻求知识，而扎布瑞尔则是为了将知识和真理武器化。她是学者、寻求真理的人、反间谍以及那些试图推翻阴谋和压迫性政权的人的守护神。那些追随她的人经常获得闪光的灵感，引导他们发现秘密。",
	"Zabriel appears as a robed figure whose face glows so brightly her features cannot be seen. She always carries a book that holds the names of every being in existence.": "扎布瑞尔以一个身穿长袍的形象出现，她的脸部光芒四射，看不清特征。她总是带着一本书，里面有每个存在的人的名字。",
	"Morael represents an aspect of the Vetara, goddess of love. Specifically, Morael represents the strength behind conviction, the ability to give up everything for something greater than one's self. As a patron of heroes, Morael receives the prayers of those looking for the strength to make impossible decisions and great sacrifices. The Arch Seraph aids those who are willing to pay the ultimate price for their cause.": "莫拉尔代表维塔拉的一个方面，即爱情女神。具体来说，莫拉尔代表了信念背后的力量，为了比自己更伟大的东西放弃一切的能力。作为英雄的守护神，莫拉尔接受那些寻求力量以做出不可能的决定和巨大牺牲的人的祈祷。大蛇神帮助那些愿意为其事业付出最终代价的人。",

	"Unlike some of her counterparts, Solyma remains faithful to the dead god of supreme justice. She has undertaken a vow of silence and will not speak until the cosmic horror that destroyed her master has been defeated for good. Until then, she does what she can to help those who seek justice in all its forms. Good-aligned vigilantes and those who destroy the abominations of the Aether Kindred can expect great rewards from Solyma.": "与她的一些同行不同，索里玛仍然忠实于死去的最高正义之神。她发誓要保持沉默，在摧毁她主人的宇宙恐怖被永远击败之前不会说话。在那之前，她会尽力帮助那些寻求各种形式正义的人。善良的守夜人和那些摧毁乙太族的恶行的人可以从索里玛那里得到巨大的奖赏。",
	"But Solyma's silence has come with a cost, and her faithful stray without guidance.": "但索里玛的沉默是有代价的，她的信徒在没有指导的情况下游荡。",
	"The name of the god who Solyma once served has been forgotten by mortalkind, and their teachings twisted to serve mortal ends. Solyma's most fervent worshippers reside in Ostoya, where whispered prayers call her the Lady of Vengeance and bloody vendettas are prosecuted in her name. Yet who is to say their idea of justice is wrong, if not silent Solyma herself?": "索里玛曾经侍奉的神的名字已经被凡人遗忘，他们的教义被扭曲以服务于凡人的目的。索里玛最狂热的崇拜者居住在奥斯托亚，那里的低声祈祷者称她为复仇女神，并以她的名义起诉血腥的仇杀行为。然而，如果不是沉默的索里玛本人，谁能说他们的正义观念是错误的呢？",
	"She is depicted as a robed, long-haired woman bearing a glowing greatsword, and whose feet do not touch the ground.": "她被描绘成一个身穿长袍、长发飘飘的女人，手持一把发光的大剑，脚不沾地。",
	"The most contemplative and peaceful of the Arch Seraphs, Aphaeleon is the patron of monks and clerics. Formerly an angel of the Myria, god of joy, he has taken a different path and is now prayed to by those who seek freedom from their worldly desires.

Those who follow his ways find great mental and spiritual strength that enables them to endure.": "阿帕里昂是大蛇神中最善于沉思、最平和的一位，是僧侣和教士的守护神。他曾是快乐之神迈瑞亚的天使，但他走了一条不同的道路，现在被那些从世俗欲望中寻求自由的人所祈求。阿帕埃隆帮助他的追随者抵制他们的成瘾和诱惑。那些追随他的人发现巨大的心理和精神力量，使他们能够忍受。",

	"Venin, the Great Deceiver, seeks to undermine mortals by tricking them into false ideologies and illusory goals. She relishes the lies people tell themselves to justify depravity and cruelty. Venin's followers gain great skill in illusions and convincing others of their versions of the truth, but eventually they lose all sense of what is real and what is not.": "大骗子维宁（Venin）试图通过诱骗凡人进入错误的意识形态和虚幻的目标来破坏他们。她喜欢人们告诉自己的谎言，以证明自己的堕落和残忍。维宁的追随者在幻觉和说服他人相信他们的真相方面获得了巨大的技巧，但最终他们失去了对什么是真实和什么不是的感觉。",

	"Replacing the war god Maligant is the Arch Daemon Tormach, a spirit of relentless conflict. Unlike Maligant, who espoused a strategy to prevent needless deaths, Tormach delights in killing and bloody violence, demanding sacrifices from his followers in exchange for power. Victory itself is unimportant to Tormach-what matters is that as much blood as possible is shed during and after the battle. Murderers and evil-aligned warriors find strength in Tormach, but are apt to give in to their bloodlust before long.": "取代战神马利根的是大魔王托马斯，一个无情的冲突的精神。与马利根不同的是，托玛赫崇尚的策略是防止无谓的死亡，他以杀戮和血腥暴力为乐，要求他的追随者用牺牲来换取权力。胜利本身对托马斯来说并不重要，重要的是在战斗中和战斗后尽可能多地流血。杀人犯和与邪恶结盟的战士在托马斯身上找到了力量，但不久就会屈服于他们的嗜血。",

	"Gorodyn has claimed the sphere of Jezra, the former god of commerce. Gorodyn exhorts mortals that greed is a virtue, and that to gather wealth and resources while the rest go without is the greatest happiness one can achieve. His followers thus seek wealth through whatever means possible, such as the merchant who hoards food and sells it at exorbitant prices. While they are rich in material wealth, their souls inevitably go hungry.": "戈罗丁（Gorodyn）占据了以前商业之神杰兹拉（Jezra）的领域。戈罗丁劝诫凡人，贪婪是一种美德，收集财富和资源，而其他人却得不到，是一个人所能获得的最大幸福。因此，他的追随者通过一切可能的手段寻求财富，例如商人囤积食物并以高价出售。虽然他们在物质财富上很富有，但他们的灵魂却不可避免地要挨饿。",

	"Where the rich and poor lose themselves to excess, lust, and debauchery, there walks Sitri. The Arch Daemon whispers into the hearts of men and women, urging them to give in to their basest instincts. He has never known more followers than in Altenheim, the City of Joy, where drugfueled parties last for days on end.": "在富人和穷人迷失自己的地方，在过度、欲望和放荡的地方，有西特里的身影。大魔王在男人和女人的心中低语，怂恿他们屈服于自己最卑微的本能。他的追随者从未像在欢乐之城阿尔滕海姆那样多，在那里，以毒品为燃料的聚会持续了好几天。",

	"Most mortals fear the Arch Daemons but, conversely, Beleth finds mortals atrociously funny. He delights in torturing them with their worst fears, knowing that the terror induced is often far worse than the actual threat. His followers are rulers who terrorize their people, priests who hold sway over the superstitious, and anyone who holds power through fear. Every single one is eventually driven to fear those they rule.": "大多数凡人都害怕大魔王，但相反地，贝勒爷觉得凡人的行为非常可笑。他乐于用他们最害怕的东西来折磨他们，因为他知道所引起的恐怖往往比实际的威胁要严重得多。他的追随者是那些恐吓人民的统治者，对迷信者有影响力的牧师，以及任何通过恐惧掌握权力的人。每一个人最终都会被驱使去恐惧他们所统治的人。",

However, as her insignia suggests, all who rise in her favor will eventually come to a terrible fall.": "马利基尔被称为最强大的大魔王，主持着暴君和腐败的英雄。她向那些向她献身的人许诺权力、名声和统治权。然而，正如她的徽章所暗示的那样，所有得到她青睐的人最终都会走向可怕的堕落。",
	"Malikir ruins the goodhearted, as even heroes that start with the best intentions can fall prey to her wiles as they grow to believe in their own legend. She has driven friends to fight each other and rulers to wage war in the name of national pride.": "马利基尔毁掉了心地善良的人，因为即使是那些一开始就怀有最美好愿望的英雄，在他们逐渐相信自己的传奇时，也会成为她诡计的牺牲品。她驱使朋友们互相厮杀，驱使统治者以民族自豪感的名义发动战争。",
	"Malikir is a towering figure of ebony, undulating flesh, with an inverted triangular head and long arms that end in claws.": "马利基尔是一个由乌黑的、起伏的肉体组成的高大形象，有一个倒三角形的头和长长的手臂，末端是爪子。",
	"When matter first formed from Chaos into fire, earth, air, and water, the Primordials opened their eyes to the light of Etharis. They spread across the land, sea, and skies, claiming territory for themselves. Then the gods decided to give a majority of Etharis to their mortal followers. War erupted with the Primordials, who, seeing they were outmatched, ceded their lands to mortals. It was this first great victory that convinced the gods to challenge the Aether Kindred, which led to their downfall.": "当物质第一次从混沌中形成火、土、空气和水时，原始人睁开了眼睛，看到了伊萨里斯的光芒。他们遍布陆地、海洋和天空，为自己争夺领土。然后，诸神决定将伊萨里斯的大部分地区交给他们的凡人追随者。与原始人的战争爆发了，原始人看到自己不敌，将自己的土地让给了凡人。正是这第一场伟大的胜利说服了众神挑战乙太族，导致了他们的衰落。",

Unable to forget, however, he wasted his days drinking enormous quantities of alcohol.": "刘的同乡们称他为英雄，但他知道自己需要为杀人赎罪。他加入了一个寺院，以洗刷他的良知。然而，由于无法忘记，他终日酗酒，浪费了大量的时间。",
	"Liu left the monastery to travel alongside adventurers, cleansing darkness wherever he went. His legend grew. It was said he could slay vampires bare-handed, that he could outfight an entire army and outdrink it as well. Yet, one by one, his comrades died or fell to darkness, and Liu was left alone. That is when his old demons found him again.": "他离开寺院，与冒险家一起旅行，所到之处净化黑暗。他的传说越来越多。据说他可以赤手空拳地杀死吸血鬼，他可以战胜整个军队，也可以喝掉军队的酒。然而，他的战友们一个接一个地死去，或倒在黑暗中，而刘则被抛在一边。这时，他的老恶魔又找到了他。",
	"Liu, as they say, drowned in a bottle. He became a derelict, and waited to die. But his legend was not over yet, and a humble gnome named Gerbo Amakiir would begin the next chapter.": "正如人们所说的那样，刘某在瓶子里淹死了。他成了一个被遗弃的人，并等待着死亡。但他的传奇还没有结束，一个名叫格布-阿马基尔的卑微地精将开始下一个篇章。",
	"Countless unsung heroes dwell in the cities working for their community every day. A shining example is the gnome bard Gerbo Amakiir.": "无数的无名英雄居住在城市中，每天为他们的社区工作。一个光辉的例子是地精吟游诗人格布-阿玛基尔。",
	"With a sharp tongue, brilliant mind, and an aptitude for the lute, young Gerbo explored the world around him and his heart broke for it. Using the wealth he amassed through his talents, he decided the best way to soothe the pain of the helpless was to start an orphanage. He thus created a huge family, where every child in need was his own. But Gerbo's success drew unfortunate attention.": "年轻的Gerbo有着敏锐的口才、聪明的头脑和弹奏琵琶的才能，他探索着周围的世界，他的心为之破碎。他利用自己的才华所积累的财富，决定抚慰无助者痛苦的最好办法是建立一个孤儿院。他因此创造了一个巨大的家庭，每个需要帮助的孩子都是他自己的。但Gerbo的成功引来了不幸的关注。",
	"A vampire ruled Gerbo's city, and that lord approached Gerbo with an ultimatum: Gerbo could only continue as a prominent figure in the city if he became a vampire as well. Gerbo could not accept or give up his orphanage, so the vampire offered an alternative: Gerbo could keep his orphanage and his mortality so long as he provided the vampire rulers a tribute of three victims a month.": "一个吸血鬼统治着Gerbo的城市，这位领主向Gerbo发出了最后通牒：Gerbo只有在成为吸血鬼后才能继续成为这个城市的重要人物。Gerbo不能接受或放弃他的孤儿院，所以吸血鬼提供了一个选择。Gerbo可以保留他的孤儿院和他的死亡率，只要他每个月向吸血鬼统治者提供三个受害者的贡品。",
	"So Gerbo became a murderer, seeing no choice but to prey on the vulnerable. And this went on for far too long.": "于是Gerbo成了一个杀人犯，除了捕食脆弱的人之外别无选择。这种情况持续了太长时间。",
	"Yet one night, as he searched for victims and prepared to kill a drunken dragonborn, he recognized the derelict as none other than the hero Liu Quizan. That night, he abandoned his deal with the vampire and nursed Liu back to health. In Liu, he realized he could have a powerful ally-and Liu found a new cause to live for in helping Gerbo put an end to the blood tribute once and for all.": "然而有一天晚上，当他寻找受害者并准备杀死一个醉酒的龙族时，他认出了这个弃儿不是别人，正是英雄刘奎山。那天晚上，他放弃了与吸血鬼的交易，将刘奎山护送回健康。在刘的身上，他意识到他可以有一个强大的盟友--刘找到了一个新的生活目标，那就是帮助杰宝彻底结束血腥的贡品。",
	"Among the peace-loving lycanthropes of the Raven's Wolves tribe, the wisest is Kainen Alabaster, known as the Witch Doctor.": "在乌鸦之狼部落的爱好和平的狼人中，最聪明的是被称为巫医的凯宁-阿拉巴斯特。",
	"Kainen was born in a small tribe of half-orc outcasts who roamed the borders of the great human and elf settlements. However, in a disastrous hunt, Kainen was bitten by a werewolf in the form of a wolf. The half-orc's spiritual strength held back the disease at first, but the urges awakened by the full moon were uncontrollable. Kainen awoke bathed in the blood of his own tribe. For a time, he lost his mind, giving in to the wolf. His cries of sorrow and rage filled the night, until the Raven's Wolves found him and taught him to control his dark side.": "凯宁出生在一个由半兽人组成的小部落，他们在伟大的人类和精灵定居点的边界上游荡。然而，在一次灾难性的狩猎中，凯宁被一个狼人的形态咬伤。半兽人的精神力量起初挡住了疾病，但被满月唤醒的冲动却无法控制。凯宁醒来时沐浴在自己部落的血液中。有一段时间，他失去了理智，向狼屈服。他悲伤和愤怒的叫声充满了整个夜晚，直到乌鸦的狼群找到他，教他控制自己的黑暗面。",
	"Kainen studied herbalism, and soon became a master. He has created potions to ease the pain of transformation, calming the wolf inside every lycanthrope. His greatest achievement is the discovery of a rare potion that he calls the Lichsbane, which can dissolve the magic that animates even the strongest undead.": "凯宁学习草药学，并很快成为一名大师。他创造了一些药水来缓解变身的痛苦，使每个狼人体内的狼性得到平静。他最伟大的成就是发现了一种罕见的药水，他称之为Lichsbane，它可以溶解使最强大的不死生物产生活力的魔法。",
	"Kainen's knowledge of every herb in the forests of the Charneault Kingdom has made him invaluable. Living a personal oath of nonviolence, Kainen Alabaster roams the woodlands seeking the remedy that would free his kin from the curse of lycanthropy once and for all.": "Kainen对Charneault王国森林中每一种草药的了解使他成为无价之宝。秉持着非暴力的个人誓言，Kainen Alabaster在林地中漫游，寻找能让他的族人彻底摆脱狼人的诅咒的药方。",
	"Etharis is full of relics of the past, some wonderful and some the products of depraved minds. None is more bizarre than the artifact called The Brass Boy. Though it looks human, beneath its paper-thin skin and painted features is a skeleton of brass tubes and gears, and veins of hissing steam. This construct is several centuries old, and its mechanical mind was built with one purpose: to learn everything about war.": "Etharis充满了过去的遗迹，有些是美好的，有些是堕落思想的产物。最奇特的莫过于名为 \"黄铜男孩 \"的人工制品。虽然它看起来像人，但在其薄如纸的皮肤和绘画的特征下，是一个由黄铜管和齿轮组成的骨架，以及嘶嘶作响的蒸汽脉络。这座建筑已有几个世纪的历史，它的机械思维只有一个目的：了解关于战争的一切。",
	"The Brass Boy was built long ago as one of many, to advise leaders on governance and promote happiness. But the Brass Boy saw its creator murdered by the king who commissioned it, and the experience warped the construct's mind. If life was so fragile and living things so evil, the Brass Boy chose to spread death.": "铜童是很久以前建造的，它是许多人中的一个，为领导人提供治理建议并促进幸福。但是，黄铜男孩看到它的创造者被委托它的国王杀害，这一经历扭曲了这个建筑的思想。如果生命是如此脆弱，生物是如此邪恶，黄铜男孩选择了传播死亡。",
	"Eventually, the Brass Boy found a new leader to serve, the warlord Sasha Seraphsbane. It uses its knowledge to help her in her war against the Castinellan Church. However, the Brass Boy waits for its moment to betray her. Its grand plan is to turn one master against another until it has created a war that will consume all life across Etharis.": "最终，黄铜男孩找到了一个新的领导者，即军阀萨沙-塞拉弗斯班，为其服务。它利用自己的知识来帮助她与卡斯蒂内尔教会的战争。然而，黄铜男孩等待着背叛她的时机。它的宏伟计划是让一个主人反对另一个主人，直到它创造了一场将吞噬整个Etharis所有生命的战争。",
	"Outlaws in Castinella measure their status by the size of the bounties. By this standard, the greatest outlaw of all must be the notorious warlock Sasha Seraphsbane.": "卡斯蒂内拉的不法分子以悬赏金的大小来衡量他们的地位。按照这个标准，最伟大的歹徒一定是臭名昭著的术士萨沙-塞拉弗斯班。",

	"Eventually, as often happens, rumors began to spread. Some claimed that the woman was a vampiress from Ostoya who had come to destroy the city. Rumors of Esperanza's affair reached the ears of her husband, and in his rage he summoned the Inquisition. Esperanza's love was arrested, tried, and burned.": "最终，正如经常发生的那样，谣言开始传播。有些人声称，这个女人是来自奥斯托亚的女吸血鬼，她是来摧毁这个城市的。关于埃斯佩兰萨偷情的谣言传到了她丈夫的耳朵里，他一怒之下召集了宗教裁判所的人。埃斯佩兰萨的爱人被逮捕、审判和焚烧。",
	"In a moment of desperation, Esperanza called upon the dark forces she had been warned against her entire life. An Arch Fiend answered her call, offering her the power to destroy her former husband and the church he served.": "在一个绝望的时刻，埃斯佩兰萨召唤了她一生中一直被警告的黑暗力量。一个大恶魔回应了她的召唤，为她提供了摧毁她的前夫和他所服务的教会的力量。",

	"Rarely seen without his full plate armour or flaming longsword, Kaine has nonetheless learned that his words can be equally powerful.

They believe he is the avatar of Empyreus, sent to purge sinners and non-believers from Etharis.": "很少有人看到他不穿全副盔甲或使用火焰长剑，但凯恩了解到他的言语也有同样的力量。他宣扬的是一种扭曲的福音，他吸引了被压迫者和贫困者加入他的军队行列。他们相信他是Empyreus的化身，被派来清除Etharis的罪人和不信教者。",
	"The church of the Castinella Provinces condemns Kaine as a heretic and a bandit, but they are stretched too thin to confront him directly.

But, cornered by the assassin, Kaine used his words to play on Gaunt's fractured psyche and escaped.": "卡斯蒂内拉省的教会谴责凯恩是个异教徒和强盗，但他们人手不足，无法直接与他对抗。走投无路之下，他们派了一个雇佣杀手--\"疯狂小丑 \"艾利斯特-冈特来悄悄地除掉凯恩。但是，被杀手逼到墙角后，凯恩用他的话来玩弄冈特那支离破碎的心灵，并逃脱了。",

His nickname, \"the Mad Jester,\" is no joke-anyone who seeks to hire him is gambling with their own life.": "艾利斯特-冈特精于计算、致命、高效、完全疯狂，他是卡斯蒂内兰省最令人畏惧的雇佣杀手，也许是世界上最可怕的杀手。他的绰号 \"疯狂的小丑 \"不是开玩笑的--任何想雇佣他的人都是在拿自己的生命做赌注。",
	"Gaunt honed his skills as a member of the Arcanist Inquisition, but the violence he excelled at there eventually snapped his mind in two.

	"Alister's twisted mind contains two versions of reality. In one, there is only death, chaos, and pain; in the other, there is only peace and kindness. Anyone who wishes to hire him must hope to find him in his pacifistic frame of mind, or else risk being his next victim.": "艾利斯特扭曲的心灵包含了两个版本的现实。在一个版本中，只有死亡、混乱和痛苦；在另一个版本中，只有和平和仁慈。任何希望雇佣他的人都必须希望找到他的和平主义心态，否则就有可能成为他的下一个受害者。",

He headed south, to the far end of Etharis, to Castinella where he had heard warriors could serve a greater cause.": "加伦在他的村庄燃烧的残骸中醒来，独自一人。他在那里呆了九天，寻找他应该活下来的理由。最后，他找到了这个理由。他向南走去，到了伊萨里斯的远端，到了卡斯蒂内拉，在那里他听说勇士们可以为一个更伟大的事业服务。",
	"Garren is now a member of the Cleansing Flame, an arm of the Knights Transcendent. He has burned more cultists, staked more vampires, and banished more fiends than he can remember.

	"His only failure, in his own eyes, is that the traitor known as the Mad Jester still lives. To put an end to the madman, he has allied himself with the demagogic paladin Kaine. These two very different paladins have unleashed a great manhunt for their shared enemy.": "在他自己看来，他唯一的失败是，被称为疯狂杰斯特的叛徒仍然活着。为了终结这个疯子，他与蛊惑人心的圣骑士凯恩结盟。这两位截然不同的圣骑士对他们共同的敌人发动了一场大搜捕。",

Grimm barely escaped, but her mother perished in the flames.": "当他们在深山老林的一个偏远空地上看到这个小屋时，他们推测那里住着一个女巫，他们知道他们必须做什么--他们烧了它，把格林和她的母亲关在里面。格林勉强逃了出来，但她的母亲却在火中丧生。",

And every child on the outskirts of the Charneault Kingdom knows that you must never do that.": "樵夫是她的第一批受害者，再也没有人见过了--但森林里出现了奇怪的树木，它们有着奇怪的人类肢体，据说如果人们听它们的树干，就会听到心跳和遥远的人类尖叫声。但要测试这一点，人们必须进入黑暗的森林。而查尼奥特王国郊区的每个孩子都知道，你绝不能这么做。",
	"Of all the acrobats, tricksters and con artists who followed the caravans over the trade routes of the Charneault Kingdom, none shined brighter than the flaming star Kizmet ‘'Kizzy'' Raine. Born in a wandering caravan of entertainers and fortune tellers, she was gifted a pure heart and dazzling beauty, with tan skin and flaming orange hair that made some suspect the blood of fire spirits ran in her veins. Furthermore, she was gifted with the power of sorcery, and an aptitude for divination. Kizmet was perhaps the only true fortune teller among all of the troupes that roamed the trade road.": "在所有跟随商队走过查尼奥特王国贸易路线的杂技演员、捣蛋鬼和骗子中，没有人比火焰之星Kizmet ''Kizzy'' Raine更闪亮。她出生在一个由艺人和算命先生组成的流浪商队中，被赋予了纯洁的心灵和耀眼的美貌，棕褐色的皮肤和火橙色的头发让人怀疑她的血管里流淌着火灵的血液。此外，她还具有巫术的力量，以及占卜的能力。基兹梅特也许是所有在贸易道路上游荡的团体中唯一真正的算命者。",

Strauss even goes abroad, accompanied by her trustworthy golem M.O.T.T., claiming it is a cunning clockwork contraption and nothing more.": "施特劳斯博士精通炼金术、巫术和科学，她的真正潜力只受限于她混乱和好奇的天性。她的作品将物理科学和魔法巧妙地融合在一起，无论是最伟大的巫师还是最伟大的工匠都无法完全理解它们。由于宗教裁判所无法确定施特劳斯的科学在哪里结束，她的（所谓的）魔法在哪里开始，他们没有追捕这位科学家的神圣使命。施特劳斯甚至在她值得信赖的傀儡M.O.T.T.的陪同下出国，声称它是一个狡猾的发条装置，仅此而已。",
	"In her endless search for knowledge, Strauss's wanderings brought her to the sorceress Kizmet Raine. They quickly grew fond of each other, but Strauss realized her new friend was cursed.

	"Vesryn had no money and no way to prove his innocence. This was the first time he prayed. A spirit of justice, answering his call, granted Vesryn its powers to sense the injustice in others' hearts. In one week, he delivered proof that he could not have been the true killer.": "维斯林没有钱，也没有办法证明自己的清白。这是他第一次祈祷。一个正义的精神回应了他的呼唤，授予Vesryn感知他人心中不公的能力。在一个星期内，他提供了证据，证明他不可能是真正的凶手。",
	"The court, ashamed of its error, offered to restore Vesryn's old position. However, Vesryn decided to answer a higher call. He founded the Justiciars, an order dedicated to defending the innocent and protecting the name of justice from its own failures.": "法院为自己的错误感到羞愧，提出恢复维斯林的旧职位。然而，Vesryn决定响应更高的号召。他成立了正义之士，一个致力于保护无辜者和保护正义之名不受其自身失败影响的组织。",
	"He never stopped searching for his lord's true killer. When the lieutenant of his order showed him evidence that the murderer was the werewolf Isaac Adstrum, Vesryn prepared himself for battle. He did not see his trusted lieutenant's malicious smile as he departed.": "他从未停止过对他的领主的真正凶手的搜寻。当他手下的副官向他展示了凶手是狼人艾萨克-阿德斯特伦的证据时，维斯林做好了战斗的准备。他没有看到他信任的中尉离去时的恶意微笑。",
	"The Raven's Wolves are a nomadic tribe of lycanthropes who try to tame their bloodlust and live in harmony with the spirits of nature. None better embodies their ideals than the werewolf warlock Isaac Adstrum.": "乌鸦之狼是一个由狼人组成的游牧部落，他们试图驯服自己的嗜血欲望，并与自然之灵和谐共处。没有人比狼人术士艾萨克-阿德斯特朗更能体现他们的理想。",
	"Adstrum has always favored peace, and finds no pleasure in the bloody passions of lycanthropy. When his violent urges are too strong, he retreats to the deep forest and meditates with the aid of his moonstone sword, Shadowfell.": "阿德斯特伦总是喜欢和平，在狼人的血腥激情中找不到乐趣。当他的暴力冲动过于强烈时，他就退缩到森林深处，借助他的月石剑Shadowfell进行冥想。",
	"However, when violence is necessary, Isaac Adstrum acts decisively. The sword Shadowfell, owned by this family for countless generations, is enchanted with spells older than the forests themselves-whenever a person presents a mortal threat to the tribe, their name appears on the blade in archaic Elven letters. The older and wiser shamans of the tribe say that this sword is the voice of the forest spirit itself. Thus, when Adstrum reads a name on his blade, he knows it is time to spill blood.": "然而，当暴力是必要的时候，艾萨克-阿德斯特伦就会果断地采取行动。这个家族无数代人拥有的Shadowfell剑，被施以比森林本身更古老的咒语--每当有人对部落构成致命威胁时，他们的名字就会以古老的精灵字母出现在剑身上。部落中年长而睿智的巫师们说，这把剑是森林精神本身的声音。因此，当阿德斯特伦在他的剑上读到一个名字时，他知道是时候流血了。",
	"Yet the latest name to appear was that of Charneault's High Justicar Vesryn-a well-known and righteous man. Isaac Adstrum hesitated, but the tribe's shamans assured him Shadowfell could not lie. So Adstrum has set out toward the most dangerous fight of his life, unaware of the sinister forces working against him.": "然而，最近出现的名字是查尼奥特的高级司法官韦斯林--一个著名的正直的人。艾萨克-阿德斯特伦犹豫不决，但部落的巫师们向他保证，影子城不可能说谎。于是，阿德斯特伦开始了他一生中最危险的战斗，他没有意识到反对他的邪恶力量。",
	"The world of Etharis draws on several genres of dark fantasy: grimdark fantasy, horror, dark fairy tales, and sword and sorcery. These are stories where good doesn't always prevail, and heroes aren't always good. Handled well, the adventures you have in Etharis can be thrilling, thought-provoking, unsettling, and unique. To strike the right balance of tones for your game, consider the elements of the different genres below.": "伊萨里斯的世界借鉴了几种黑暗幻想的流派：严峻的黑暗幻想、恐怖、黑暗童话和剑与巫术。这些故事中，正义并不总是占上风，英雄也不总是好的。如果处理得好，你在Etharis的冒险可以是惊险的、发人深省的、令人不安的和独特的。为了在你的游戏中取得适当的色调平衡，请考虑以下不同类型的元素。",
	"Grimdark is like film noir, in the sense that both genres realise that there are no truly good heroes left. In either setting, everyone struggles with impossible moral choices.": "Grimdark就像黑色电影，在这个意义上，两种类型都意识到没有真正的好英雄了。在这两种背景下，每个人都在不可能的道德选择中挣扎。",
	"Even supposedly good people are flawed, while villains don't think twice about committing atrocities. A happy ending where everyone survives is unlikely.": "即使是所谓的好人也是有缺陷的，而反派人物在实施暴行时也不会多想。一个人人都能活下来的大团圆结局是不太可能的。",
	"Grimdark fantasy adopts realism, albeit from the grittier side of the spectrum. The horrors and ills of a real society exist in this one-only this time, no one questions why they are there. Racism, classism, and hyper-nationalism are all par for the course, and upsetting the status quo can have actual unhappy consequences for the defiant parties.": "阴暗的幻想采用了现实主义，尽管是在光谱中比较粗糙的一边。现实社会中的恐怖和弊端都存在于此，只是这一次，没有人质疑为什么它们会存在。种族主义、阶级主义和超民族主义都是正常的，而破坏现状会给违抗者带来实际的不愉快后果。",
	"When it comes to war, a grimdark setting won't emphasise the glory and heroism of battle so much as the sacrifices made to win, the costs to innocent lives, the destruction of homes, and the toll on the soldiers on both sides of the conflict.": "当涉及到战争时，严峻的背景不会强调战斗的荣耀和英雄主义，而是强调为赢得胜利而做出的牺牲、无辜生命的代价、家园的破坏以及冲突双方士兵的伤亡。",
	"As for magic, it often comes at an unspeakable cost and with terrible consequences when things go wrong. Infernal pacts that cost souls and unleash eldritch horrors are a prime example.": "至于魔法，它往往要付出难以言喻的代价，而且一旦出错就会带来可怕的后果。以灵魂为代价并释放出长生不老的恐怖的地狱契约就是一个最好的例子。",
	"That said, it's important that everything happens as a consequence of choices the characters made. A world that is cruel for cruelty's sake is not only illogical, but it's also boring and hard to navigate for players. A grimdark setting must serve a purpose-to highlight the risks of the campaign, and to engage the players with realism. Using it purely for shock value will eventually wear down your players, and likely yourself as well.": "这就是说，重要的是，所有事情的发生都是人物所做选择的结果。一个为残忍而残忍的世界不仅不符合逻辑，而且对玩家来说也很无聊，难以驾驭。阴暗的设定必须有一个目的--突出活动的风险，用现实主义来吸引玩家。纯粹为了冲击价值而使用它，最终会使你的玩家疲惫不堪，而且很可能也会使你自己疲惫不堪。",
	"Horror is by no means the easiest genre to create stories for. It relies on the right amount of tension, atmosphere, and imagery to work. If these are lacking, or if they're overdone, it can quickly turn into unintended comedy.": "恐怖片绝不是最容易创作的故事类型。它依赖于适量的紧张、气氛和图像来发挥作用。如果缺乏这些，或者它们被过度使用，它就会很快变成意外的喜剧。",
	"There are many levels of horror, including terror, dread, and revulsion. Revulsion is easy to elicit; it can come from something as straightforwardly disgusting as slipping on a pile of corpses and falling into a pool of blood and viscera.": "恐怖有很多层次，包括恐怖、恐惧和反感。反感是很容易引起的；它可以来自于一些直接令人厌恶的事情，如滑倒在一堆尸体上，掉进一滩血和内脏里。",
	"Dread is more difficult. It requires slow-building tension and a description of an atmosphere that is both immediate and mysterious. The idea is to give the player the feeling that something terrible is about to happen, but they don't quite know when it will happen. The longer you can sustain this build-up, the more powerful the release. So you can describe them going down a dark corridor or a shadowy forest, and they would catch glimpses of creatures moving from the corner of their eyes. They know they are being followed and an attack is imminent-but they don't know when or by what.": "恐惧是比较困难的。它要求缓慢地制造紧张气氛，并描述一种既直接又神秘的气氛。其目的是让玩家感觉到可怕的事情即将发生，但他们并不十分清楚何时会发生。你能维持这种积累的时间越长，释放的力量就越大。所以你可以描述他们走在黑暗的走廊或阴暗的森林里，他们会从眼角瞥见生物的移动。他们知道自己被跟踪，攻击迫在眉睫--但他们不知道什么时候，也不知道被什么攻击。",
	"The final layer is terror, a release of emotion that comes from shock and the realisation that something horrible is happening that is beyond the players' control. This is difficult to evoke since most players often feel in control of situations thanks to their power and abilities. The key is in catching them unawares and upending their expectations. For example, the party could defeat the seemingly human corrupt inquisitor, only for his head to split open and reveal a monstrous, tentacled thing using human flesh as its shell. From a moment like this you not only get revulsion but a possible heart-stopping kick in the gut.": "最后一层是恐怖，一种来自震惊和意识到发生了玩家无法控制的可怕事情的情感释放。这是很难唤起的，因为大多数玩家经常觉得自己的力量和能力可以控制局面。关键是要让他们措手不及，颠覆他们的期望。例如，玩家可以击败看起来像人类的腐败审问者，但他的头却裂开了，露出一个以人肉为外壳的可怕的、有触角的东西。从这样的时刻开始，你不仅会感到反感，而且可能会感到心惊肉跳的一击。",
	"A dark, overgrown forest where wolves and witches roam. An inn owned by an outwardly jolly old fellow who kills and robs weary travelers as they sleep. A cursed princess who must slay those she marries on her wedding night. Evil fairies whose gifts are never as they seem, and will both help and hinder those who accept them. These are some of the many tropes of dark fairy tales.": "一个黑暗的、杂草丛生的森林，狼和女巫在那里游荡。一家客栈，老板是一个外表快乐的老家伙，他在疲惫的旅行者睡觉时杀人抢劫。一个被诅咒的公主，必须在新婚之夜杀死她所嫁的人。邪恶的仙女，她们的礼物从来都不像看上去那样，既会帮助也会阻碍接受它们的人。这些都是黑暗童话中的一些套路。",
	"Dark fairy tales are similar to the grimdark genre, only they lean towards fantasy instead of realism. Things begin as outwardly normal, even hopeful. Then the screws begin to tighten as the characters discover the reality of their situation.": "黑暗童话与灰暗类型相似，只是它们更倾向于幻想而不是现实主义。事情开始时表面上很正常，甚至充满希望。然后，随着人物发现他们的现实处境，螺丝开始拧紧。",
	"The most important aspect of creating a dark fairy tale setting is an awareness of the elements used in such stories. Reading original Grimm Brothers' stories will give you an idea, as well as more modern takes by fantasy authors.": "创作黑暗童话的最重要方面是对此类故事中使用的元素的认识。阅读格林兄弟的原创故事会给你一个概念，以及幻想作家的更多现代作品。",
	"Exemplified in the works of authors Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock, the sword and sorcery genre sets aside idealism for a world soaked in mud, blood, and magic.": "在作家罗伯特-霍华德（Robert E. Howard）和迈克尔-莫尔科克（Michael Moorcock）的作品中，剑与魔法类型的作品将理想主义搁置一旁，让世界浸泡在泥土、血液和魔法中。",
	"Much like the grimdark genre, sword and sorcery approaches a fantastic setting from an amoral perspective, with a particular focus on action. Characters live in a gritty, violent world of barbarism, corrupt kings, evil sorcerers, sword wielding warriors, and horrifying beasts that threaten damsels-in-inevitable-distress. It can be set in a fallen kingdom or a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland. Most of all, the combat scenes are visceral, dynamic, and absolutely blood-soaked.": "与严峻的流派非常相似，剑与魔法从非道德的角度接近一个奇妙的环境，特别注重行动。角色们生活在一个充满野蛮、暴力的世界里，有腐败的国王、邪恶的巫师、挥舞着剑的战士，以及威胁着不可避免的少女的可怕的野兽。它的背景可以是一个堕落的王国，也可以是末世的沙漠荒地。最重要的是，战斗场面是内脏的、动态的，而且绝对是血淋淋的。",
	"The other half of the equation, magic, is similarly important. Like with grimdark, magic is essentially dangerous, difficult to control, and forbidden. Those who use it pay a high price in terms of blood, souls, or their own humanity.": "等式的另一半，魔法，也同样重要。与严峻的黑暗一样，魔法本质上是危险的，难以控制的，而且是被禁止的。那些使用它的人在血液、灵魂或他们自己的人性方面付出了高昂的代价。",
	"Whether a campaign is grimdark, horror-based, dark fairy tales, or sword-and-sorcery, remember to give your players a break. A campaign full of relentless cruelty and darkness can get old if that's all you present. Let there be moments of peace, triumph, humor, and lightheartedness to let their mind rest before going back into the fray. As with anything, variety makes the difference.": "无论一个战役是严峻的、以恐怖为基础的、黑暗的童话故事，还是剑与魔法，记得要让你的玩家休息一下。如果一个充满无情的残酷和黑暗的战役是你所呈现的全部，那么它就会变老。让他们有和平、胜利、幽默和轻松的时刻，让他们在回到战场之前休息一下。就像任何事情一样，多样性使人与众不同。",
	"Good adventures revolve around conflict, the engine that drives all stories. The characters must summon all their skills, wits, and resources to resolve the conflict. As such, the quality of the conflict determines the quality of the narrative.": "好的冒险故事都是围绕着冲突展开的，这是驱动所有故事的引擎。人物必须调动他们所有的技能、智慧和资源来解决冲突。因此，冲突的质量决定了叙事的质量。",
	"When designing conflicts for narrative, pay attention to three critical questions:": "在为叙事设计冲突时，要注意三个关键问题。",
	"{@b What?} - Namely, what is the conflict all about?": "{@b What?} - 即，冲突是怎么回事？",
	"{@b So what?} - What is the characters' stake in this matter? Why should they care?": "{@b So what?}--人物在这件事上的利益是什么？他们为什么要关心？",
	"{@b Now what?} - What are the immediate and long-term goals they need to achieve to resolve the problem?": "{@b Now what?} - 为了解决问题，他们需要实现的近期和长期目标是什么？",
	"For games set in a large and complex world such as Etharis, GMs would do well to focus on three kinds of conflict: character-based, party-based, and region-based.": "对于像Etharis这样的大型复杂世界的游戏，GM最好将注意力集中在三种冲突上：基于角色的、基于政党的和基于地区的。",
	"At some point, players will develop their character's history or background. It would help to explain the kind of world Etharis is to your players before they generate characters so they can think of something that fits well into the setting, but ultimately the decision belongs to them.": "在某些时候，玩家会发展他们角色的历史或背景。在玩家生成角色之前，向他们解释Etharis是一个什么样的世界会有帮助，这样他们可以想出一些很适合这个环境的东西，但最终决定权还是属于他们。",
	"When players bring their characters into Etharis, they bring with them their own goals, desires, flaws, and bonds. In essence, they are bringing with them their own conflicts, which can form the seeds of a story.": "当玩家把他们的角色带入Etharis时，他们带来了自己的目标、欲望、缺陷和纽带。从本质上讲，他们带来了自己的冲突，这些冲突可以形成一个故事的种子。",
	"Take notes as they relate their backstory and listen for salient points that you can use for the game. Not only do your efforts work to enrich your tale, you will draw your players deeper into the story as they feel they have a stake in the game.": "在他们讲述他们的背景故事时做笔记，听他们说一些你可以在游戏中使用的突出要点。你的努力不仅可以丰富你的故事，还可以吸引你的玩家深入到故事中，因为他们觉得自己与游戏有关系。",
	"Lokthar's story contains elements the GM can use to motivate him on all sorts of adventures. Lokthar has a long-term goal (marry the merchant's daughter) and short-term goals (catch the thief, retrieve the signet stone).": "Lokthar的故事包含了GM可以用来激励他进行各种冒险的元素。Lokthar有一个长期的目标（娶商人的女儿）和短期的目标（抓住小偷，找回标志石）。",
	"Offer him a way to get closer to these goals, and he will probably take it. Put an obstacle between him and these goals, and he'll try to get around it. (Conversely, if you offer him an adventure that doesn't get him any closer to those goals, he might ignore it.)": "给他提供一个接近这些目标的方法，他可能会接受。在他和这些目标之间设置一个障碍，他就会试图绕过它。(相反，如果你给他提供的冒险不能让他更接近这些目标，他可能会忽略它）。",
	"Party-level conflicts are what the players must work together to resolve. The story hook leads them to the conflict, which then escalates as they confront the antagonists and their minions. If you find yourself stuck for ideas, the Etharis sourcebook contains plenty of cults, secret organisations, monstrous abominations, mad wizards, and eldritch entities to put in front of your characters. A string of antagonists leading to a primary foe can keep your party engaged for months on end.": "党派层面的冲突是玩家必须共同解决的问题。故事的钩子将他们引向冲突，然后随着他们与敌对者及其爪牙的对抗而升级。如果你发现自己的想法被卡住了，Etharis资料手册中包含了大量的邪教、秘密组织、畸形的憎恶、疯狂的巫师和超自然的实体，可以放在你的角色面前。一连串的对立面导致了一个主要的敌人，可以让你的队伍连续几个月参与其中。",
	"Remember to keep focus on what the PCs are trying to achieve. It's not enough for the party to learn about the sorcerer Gorm while they are saving the princess—they might decide it's not their problem, as long as the princess is safe. To ensure the heroes care about this new conflict, it needs to get in the way of the goal they are already pursuing.": "记住要把重点放在NPC所要实现的目标上。当他们在拯救公主时，仅仅了解巫师戈姆是不够的--他们可能会认为这不是他们的问题，只要公主安全就好。为了确保英雄们关心这个新的冲突，它需要妨碍他们已经在追求的目标。",
	"Regional conflicts occur as the backdrop to your party's adventures. They include such things as the war between Ostoya and the Bürach Empire, the shadow war between various factions such as the inquisitions by the Watchers of the Faith, and ongoing disasters such as the Weeping Pox.": "区域性冲突作为你的队伍冒险的背景而发生。它们包括诸如奥斯托亚和布拉克帝国之间的战争、各派别之间的影子战争，如信仰守望者的审讯，以及正在发生的灾难，如哭泣的痘痘。",
	"Such conflicts are meant to ground the party's adventures in a living, breathing world filled with power shifts and constant change, where things happen that are much bigger than they are. The characters may influence the outcome of these conflicts or vice versa, should their story take them there.": "这样的冲突是为了让党的冒险在一个充满权力转移和不断变化的活生生的世界中立足，在那里发生的事情比他们本身大得多。人物可以影响这些冲突的结果，反之亦然，如果他们的故事把他们带到那里。",
	"Remember that tying a story into a regional conflict adds texture to the story, but doesn't necessarily give the PCs more reason to get involved. Over time, you may find ways to organically weave character, party, and regional conflicts together into a cohesive plotline. You don't necessarily have to do it overnight; take your time to plan how the story may unfold. See how a character's backstory may connect to the party's quest, and how that may link to a conflict currently brewing in the region.": "记住，将一个故事与地区冲突联系在一起会增加故事的质感，但不一定会给NPC带来更多参与的理由。随着时间的推移，你可能会找到将角色、党派和地区冲突有机地编织成一条有凝聚力的情节线的方法。你不一定要在一夜之间做到这一点；花点时间来计划故事可能的展开方式。看看一个角色的背景故事如何与党的任务相联系，以及如何与目前在该地区酝酿的冲突相联系。",
	"Having said that, don't be married to your plans. Role-playing is shared storytelling, and your players may have their own ideas that may ultimately prove more satisfying. Be open to these ideas as they may organically enrich your conflict, and therefore your narrative.": "话虽如此，但不要与你的计划结婚。角色扮演是分享故事，你的玩家可能有他们自己的想法，最终可能被证明更令人满意。要对这些想法持开放态度，因为它们可能会有机地丰富你的冲突，从而丰富你的叙述。",
	"Just as the pacing of your sessions is a strong contributor to the flow of your campaign, so is the rate and the method by which your players level up. While the conventional method of leveling up via experience points is a valid approach, it does have some shortcomings. In particular, it focuses exclusively on killing enemies through combat encounters. If combat-based progression works well within your campaign then this is a good result and your party can continue using what works well for them. However, if you want a more narrative-based game, want to encourage players to roleplay more, or simply want to try something new, consider one of the options below.": "就像你的会议节奏对你的活动的流程有很大的贡献一样，你的玩家升级的速度和方法也是如此。虽然通过经验值提升等级的传统方法是一种有效的方法，但它确实有一些缺点。特别是，它只专注于通过战斗遭遇来杀死敌人。如果基于战斗的进展在你的战役中运作良好，那么这是一个很好的结果，你的队伍可以继续使用对他们很有效的方法。然而，如果你想要一个更加基于叙事的游戏，想要鼓励玩家进行更多的角色扮演，或者只是想尝试一些新的东西，可以考虑下面的选项之一。",
	"To follow the milestone progression process, at the end of a session simply ask the following question:": "要遵循里程碑式的进展过程，在一次会议结束时，只需提出以下问题。",
	"\"Has this session been a defining moment for the current story arc of our campaign?\"": "\"这届会议对我们目前的竞选故事弧线是否是一个决定性的时刻？\"",
	"If the answer is yes, and you feel it makes sense to do so, award the party with a level increase. While there is no correct pacing set in stone when it comes to awarding milestones, it is often best to do it about every 3-5 sessions.": "如果答案是肯定的，而且你觉得这样做是有意义的，那么就给党派增加一个等级。虽然在授予里程碑时没有正确的节奏，但通常最好是每3-5次就授予一次。",
	"Milestone progression focuses on the achievements of your party in a reactive manner. While it is possible to plan milestones ahead of time, the best results come from identifying and awarding them upon completion, or slightly before. After all, it is much easier to identify meaningful milestones after (or just before) they happen.": "里程碑式的进展以一种反应式的方式关注你的队伍的成就。虽然提前计划里程碑是可能的，但最好的结果是在完成时或稍早时确定并授予它们。毕竟，在有意义的里程碑发生之后（或之前）确定它们要容易得多。",
	"If you have pre-planned milestones, you might be tempted to dictate the party's behavior, which your players will likely resent.": "如果你有预先计划好的里程碑，你可能会被诱惑去支配聚会的行为，而你的玩家可能会反感。",
	"This is a proactive approach where the players direct the pace of the game by choosing their own milestones in the form of Goals. While this can be more difficult to pull off, it can increase player buy-in and engagement. It can make planning in advance more difficult, you can mitigate this by asking players to choose the next session's goals at the end of each session. That way you have time to reflect on the goals as you set up the next session.": "这是一种积极主动的方法，玩家通过选择自己的里程碑式的目标来引导游戏的节奏。虽然这可能更难实现，但它可以提高玩家的认同感和参与度。这可能会使提前计划变得更加困难，你可以通过要求玩家在每节课结束时选择下一节课的目标来缓解这一问题。这样你就有时间在设置下一节课时思考这些目标。",
	"To run a campaign with goal-based progression, there are two important steps to take. First you should establish the world and ensure your players know enough about what's going on to set interesting goals for their characters. This is best achieved by running a short, structured story arc at the beginning of the campaign introducing major themes and influencing factors. Step two is to openly communicate with the party and ask, \"What do you want to do?\" offering suggestions when the party is unsure. This gets the party involved in shaping the story. Once the party has completed a goal milestone, allocate experience or give them a level depending on the difficulty of the goal.": "要运行一个以目标为基础的活动，有两个重要步骤要做。首先，你应该建立一个世界，并确保你的玩家对发生的事情有足够的了解，以便为他们的角色设定有趣的目标。要做到这一点，最好的办法是在活动开始时运行一个简短的、结构化的故事弧，介绍主要的主题和影响因素。第二步是公开与当事人沟通，并问：\"你想做什么？\"在当事人不确定的时候提供建议。这让当事人参与到塑造故事中来。一旦党派完成了一个目标里程碑，根据目标的难度分配经验或给他们一个等级。",
	"The party has discussed it among themselves and decided their goal is to slay the Dread Knight Maleketh, but decide they aren't ready yet. Therefore the party comes up with a few goals they wish to complete beforehand. The party decides they want to establish useful allies, find some better equipment, and infiltrate the castle, each as a separate goal. They start working on these goals and gain experience whenever they achieve one of them.": "队伍经过讨论，决定他们的目标是杀死可怕的骑士Maleketh，但决定他们还没有准备好。因此，党派提出了一些他们希望提前完成的目标。队伍决定要建立有用的盟友，找到一些更好的装备，并潜入城堡，每个目标都是独立的。他们开始为这些目标工作，每当他们实现其中一个目标时就会获得经验。",
	"Establishing the proper level of difficulty in your encounters is as much an art as it is a science. Set the encounter difficulty too low, and you'll hear complaints about the adventure being too easy. Set it too high, and you'll end up killing the party before you can conclude the story. Finding the right balance is key to an enjoyable and rewarding experience.": "在你的奇遇中建立适当的难度是一门艺术，也是一门科学。把遭遇的难度设置得太低，你会听到关于冒险太容易的抱怨。如果设置得太高，你就会在结束故事之前就杀了整个团队。找到正确的平衡点是获得愉快和有价值的经验的关键。",
	"Before deciding on an appropriate level for combat encounters, it would help to give your players a heads-up on what to expect in terms of difficulty, particularly if there are newbies at the table. Without giving details away, let them know if you plan on using deadly encounters where getting killed is likely. That way, your players aren't caught completely off guard when the difficulty scales up. When scaling combat encounters, you have several options to choose from.": "在决定战斗遭遇的适当级别之前，给你的玩家提个醒，告诉他们在难度方面的预期，特别是如果桌子上有新手的话，会有帮助。在不透露细节的情况下，让他们知道你是否计划使用有可能被杀死的致命遭遇。这样一来，你的玩家就不会在难度增加时完全措手不及。在扩大战斗遭遇的规模时，你有几个选项可以选择。",
	"A standard way for raising the difficulty level of encounters is to simply use stronger monsters. This has the advantage of immediately giving your players an idea of what they're in for. If they're confronted by an adult black dragon (CR 14) or two, for example, they'll know to put in the effort (or run away).": "提高遭遇战难度的一个标准方法是使用更强大的怪物。这样做的好处是可以立即让你的玩家知道他们将面临什么。例如，如果他们面对的是一两只成年黑龙（CR14），他们就会知道要付出努力（或逃跑）。",
	"Given the milieu of Etharis, it is suggested to make the CR of encounters two levels higher than the party average for a greater challenge. For further challenge, see the Creating Legends section of this guide.": "考虑到Etharis的环境，建议使遭遇的CR值比队伍的平均水平高两级，以获得更大的挑战。关于进一步的挑战，请参见本指南的 \"创造传奇 \"部分。",
	"Another way to scale the difficulty is to design the battlefield in such a way that it hinders the party or helps the monsters.": "另一种调整难度的方法是将战场设计成阻碍一方或帮助怪物的方式。",
	"Swamps with knee-high water, slippery glacial floors and walls, areas with high winds that make flying difficult, slime-covered surfaces that discourage running, rooms filled with poison gas, cold places that sap one's strength-there are countless ways to turn the terrain against the party. Mechanically, these may cause effects such as making players move at half speed, forcing them to make saving throws against status effects, preventing them from flying, and so on. Areas with different elevations can add the danger of lethal falls-something that the players may even take advantage of.": "沼泽地里有齐膝高的水，滑溜溜的冰川地面和墙壁，有大风的地方让人难以飞行，粘液覆盖的表面让人无法奔跑，房间里充满了毒气，寒冷的地方会消耗人的力量--有无数种方法可以让地形对当事人不利。从机制上讲，这可能会造成一些影响，比如让玩家以半速移动，迫使他们对状态效果进行蓄力，阻止他们飞行，等等。有不同海拔的地区可以增加致命坠落的危险--玩家甚至可以利用这一点。",
	"The advantage of this tactic is that the players won't know the effects of the terrain until the battle is joined, and they will be forced to compensate.": "这种战术的好处是，在战斗加入之前，玩家不会知道地形的影响，他们将被迫进行补偿。",
	"Intelligent monsters know to pick terrain that works with their skills and abilities. Thus, incorporeal undead like ghosts and wraiths can ambush players in narrow corridors, where they can fade through the walls and floors to escape retaliation. Kobolds and orcs can shoot through arrow slits behind walls to give them cover. Abominations can engage on slime-covered floors that are difficult terrain for everyone but themselves. Earth elementals can fight in pitch-black rooms where their tremorsense is extremely effective.": "聪明的怪物知道要选择适合它们的技能和能力的地形。因此，像幽灵和鬼魂这样的无体亡灵可以在狭窄的走廊里伏击玩家，在那里它们可以穿过墙壁和地板，躲避报复。哥布林和兽人可以通过墙壁后面的箭缝进行射击，为他们提供掩护。憎恶者可以在粘液覆盖的地板上交战，这些地板对除了他们自己之外的所有人来说都是困难的地形。土元素可以在漆黑的房间里战斗，他们的震颤感应非常有效。",
	"You have the license to be creative in how you want to use the terrain to give your monsters the edge in battle. It makes them seem like more of a threat to your players.": "你可以创造性地使用地形，使你的怪兽在战斗中获得优势。这使它们看起来对你的玩家更有威胁。",
	"Here is another way to invisibly scale the difficulty: have the monsters enter and attack in waves. These waves may come in at the top of each round or during a lull in combat. The first wave would function simply as cannon fodder, lulling the players into a false sense of security. Subsequent waves would hold deadlier monsters.": "这里有另一种无形地提高难度的方法：让怪物们一波一波地进入并攻击。这些浪潮可以在每一轮的顶部或在战斗的空隙中涌入。第一波的功能只是作为炮灰，让玩家陷入一种虚假的安全感。随后的几波会有更致命的怪物。",
	"Thus, for the first wave, they may face a few weak guards on duty in the castle's main hall. In the next round, a squad of elite guards rush in, having heard the commotion. On the third round, a pair of heavily armoured captains show up with their pet troll.": "因此，对于第一波，他们可能会面对在城堡主厅值班的几个弱小的卫兵。在下一回合，一队精英卫兵听到骚动后冲了进来。在第三轮，一对全副武装的队长带着他们的宠物巨魔出现了。",
	"This tactic has the effect of tempting inexperienced players to exhaust their resources on early waves. Even against experienced players, you may mix in this technique to cause them to hold back their abilities early on, in case a more formidable foe could be on its way.": "这种战术的效果是诱使没有经验的玩家在早期阶段耗尽他们的资源。即使是对有经验的玩家，你也可以混合使用这种技巧，使他们在早期保留自己的能力，以防更可怕的敌人即将到来。",
	"Finally, this technique gives you leeway to invisibly scale down your encounter when needed. If your players are having a difficult time with the first or second wave, you can reduce the monsters in the third wave, or do without further waves altogether.": "最后，这个技巧给了你回旋的余地，可以在需要时无形地缩小你的遭遇。如果你的玩家在第一或第二波中遇到困难，你可以减少第三波中的怪物，或者完全不增加波数。",
	"Rests are crucial for characters to regain their resources, especially for those with spells slots and abilities that require long rests to recover. For players seeking a more challenging experience in Etharis, you can change the rules for resting into the following suggested format:": "休息对于角色恢复资源至关重要，特别是对于那些拥有需要长时间休息才能恢复的法术槽和能力的角色。对于在Etharis寻求更多挑战的玩家来说，你可以将休息的规则改为以下建议格式。",
	"Quick rest (1 hour) - characters may consume hit dice to regain hit points and that is all.": "快速休息（1小时）--人物可以消耗命中率骰子来恢复命中率，仅此而已。",

	"Long rest (72 hours) - characters may gain the regular benefits of a Long Rest, but with the added requirement that they rest somewhere that affords them shelter, comfort, warmth, and relative safety, such as in a settlement or a homestead. This will encourage the party to actually seek out places of civilisation in order to replenish their resources.": "长时间休息（72小时）--角色可以获得长时间休息的常规好处，但增加了一个要求，即他们必须在能够为他们提供住所、舒适、温暖和相对安全的地方休息，例如在一个定居点或家园。这将鼓励他们真正寻找文明的地方，以补充他们的资源。",
	"When creating encounters, it is often situationally appropriate to pit the party against a singular enemy. However, what is meant to be a dangerous and climactic boss fight sometimes ends as a one-way romp, not presenting a challenge for the players. This is largely due to the single creature taking far fewer actions per round of combat than the party. Legendary templates are designed to assist in this process and help make non-legendary creatures present a greater threat.": "在创建遭遇战时，让玩家与一个单一的敌人对战往往是形势所需。然而，本应是危险的、高潮迭起的BOSS战，有时却以单程漫游结束，没有给玩家带来挑战。这主要是由于单一生物在每轮战斗中所采取的行动远远少于聚会。传奇模板旨在协助这一过程，并帮助使非传奇生物呈现更大的威胁。",
	"To implement a legendary template, select a monster that you wish to run that is not already legendary. It is recommended you select a monster that is at least CR 3 or higher. Next, select a template from below and add it to the monsters stats. You should select a template that fits the existing abilities of the monster, such as the Spellcaster template for an archmage or a Commander for a hobgoblin warlord.": "要实现一个传奇模板，请选择一个你想运行的、还没有成为传奇的怪物。建议你选择一个至少是CR3或更高的怪物。接下来，从下面选择一个模板并将其添加到怪物的属性中。你应该选择一个适合怪物现有能力的模板，例如大法师的施法者模板或妖精战神的指挥官模板。",

Upon hitting the target, the target is knocked {@condition prone}.": "布鲁斯直接向一个目标敌方生物移动，速度达到其一半。如果这个移动使它在该目标的5英尺范围内，它可以对该生物进行一次武器攻击。击中目标后，目标被击倒（%0%）。",

	"The Spellcaster casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.": "施法者从其准备好的法术列表中施放一个法术，如常使用一个法术槽。",
	"Whenever a player character is reduced to 0 hit points, they roll {@dice 2d6} and subtract from the result the number of existing Grievous Wounds they have. They then apply the modified result from the {@table Grievous Wound|GH} Table. If a player rolls the same result as one they already have a wound for, they skip this result and select the next lowest result they do not have as a wound. Results with a * next to them can be taken more than once.": "每当玩家角色的命中率降至0，他们就会掷出{@dice 2d6}，并从结果中减去他们现有的重伤数目。然后他们应用{@table Grievous Wound|GH}表中的修正结果。如果玩家掷出的结果与他们已经有伤的结果相同，他们就跳过这个结果，选择他们没有的下一个最低结果作为伤。旁边有*号的结果可以多次使用。",

The origins and spread of these diseases are questions where the natural and the supernatural blur together. Whether or not your adventurers become sick themselves, they will surely encounter the effects of these diseases, from plague-stricken cities to eerily depopulated countrysides.": "困扰Etharis的疾病对其人民来说是致命的，也是神秘的，就像任何怪物一样。这些疾病的起源和传播是自然和超自然模糊不清的问题。无论你的冒险者自己是否生病，他们肯定会遇到这些疾病的影响，从瘟疫肆虐的城市到阴森的乡村。",

	"The taproom occupies a small alcove to the left of the entrance, and is stocked with barrels of maplewood ale and aged wine. Bryn stands behind the bar, washing tankards. He is an imposing figure among the tavern guests, with a broad adventurer's build. He regards the newcomers with a surly expression. \"You might as well sit down,\" he says gruffly. The other occupants are likewise unwelcoming, and stare at the characters with murmurs of, \"More of 'em ey,\" and, \"Tavern's caught a right brace of 'em this time.\"": "自来水室占据了入口处左边的一个小凹槽，里面放着一桶桶枫木麦芽酒和陈年葡萄酒。布林站在吧台后面，清洗酒罐。在酒馆的客人中，他是个威严的人物，有着宽大的冒险家的身材。他用一种愤怒的表情看着新来的人。\"你们还是坐下吧。\"他粗声粗气地说。其他住客也同样不欢迎他们，他们盯着这些人物，喃喃自语道：\"又来了，\"还有，\"酒馆这次抓到了一队人。\"",
	"The dwarf rounds on the characters. \"Enjoy it while ye still can, ye'll find no small comforts 'ere. Food tastes like ash, ale turns to water.

Whittled away at a mouse hole until it was big enough for him to slip out. Never saw 'im again.\"": "矮人在人物上打转。\"趁你还能享受，你会发现这里的舒适度不小。食物吃起来像灰，麦酒变成了水。就连那边的阿伦也不能再在二楼行走了。他说这就像在盐沼中行走。但我不会留下来。听说有一个男孩从阁楼上爬出来。凿开了一个老鼠洞，直到它大到足以让他溜出去。再也没见过他。\"",
	"A door at the southernmost end of the hallway snickers and appears to tremble. Unlike the other doors which are numbered ascendingly, this door has the same number as its neighbour. The wood of the door appears to tremble and boil, warping into a slick blackish-purple mouth lined with two rows of teeth as thick as a forearm. Six amber eyes blink in unison, surveying the characters. \"Who pass'd 'ere gives it food,\" the {@creature mimic} lisps in Common, extending a pseudopod threateningly. The mimic will not attack the party if they offer it food.": "走廊最南端的一扇门嗤嗤作响，似乎在颤抖。与其他门的编号递增不同，这扇门的编号与它的邻居相同。门的木材似乎在颤抖和沸腾，扭曲成一张光滑的黑紫色的嘴，里面有两排像前臂一样粗的牙齿。六只琥珀色的眼睛不约而同地眨着，打量着这些人物。\"谁经过这里给了它食物，\"（%0%）用普通话说，威胁性地伸出一个假肢。如果他们向它提供食物，这只模仿者就不会攻击他们。",
	"Of all the acrobats, tricksters and con artists who followed the caravans over the trade routes of the Charneault Kingdom, none shined brighter than the flaming star Kizmet ''Kizzy'' Raine. Born in a wandering caravan of entertainers and fortune tellers, she was gifted a pure heart and dazzling beauty, with tan skin and flaming orange hair that made some suspect the blood of fire spirits ran in her veins. Furthermore, she was gifted with the power of sorcery, and an aptitude for divination. Kizmet was perhaps the only true fortune teller among all of the troupes that roamed the trade road.": "在所有跟随商队走过查尼奥特王国贸易路线的杂技演员、捣蛋鬼和骗子中，没有人比火焰之星Kizmet ''Kizzy'' Raine更闪亮。她出生在一个由艺人和算命先生组成的流浪商队中，被赋予了纯洁的心灵和耀眼的美貌，棕褐色的皮肤和火橙色的头发让人怀疑她的血管里流淌着火灵的血液。此外，她还具有巫术的力量，以及占卜的能力。基兹梅特也许是所有在贸易道路上游荡的团体中唯一真正的算命者。"
