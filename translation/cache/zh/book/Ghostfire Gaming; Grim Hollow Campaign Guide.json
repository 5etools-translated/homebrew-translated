In addition, while attuned to this weapon, its users speed is increased by 5 feet and they have advantage on initiative rolls.": "使用这把剑的人在使用这把魔法武器进行攻击和伤害的时候，可以获得+1。此外，当与此武器相匹配时，其使用者的速度会增加5英尺，并且在主动性卷轴上具有优势。",
	"{@b {@i Curse.}} This greatsword is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to the attuned. As long as the curse remains the owner is unwilling to part with the greatsword, keeping it on their person at all times. Anyone attuned to this weapon has disadvantage on all attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.": "{@b {@i Curse.}}这把大剑被诅咒了，成为它的附庸者会将诅咒延伸到附庸者身上。只要诅咒还在，它的主人就不愿意与这把大剑分离，并一直将它带在身上。任何与此武器相适应的人在使用此武器以外的其他武器进行攻击时都处于不利地位。",

	"Another deadly invention, but not by gnomes, Shadow Steel is said to require souls to be produced. According to rumours, the souls are torn into pieces using dark spells and transformed into a raw spiritual essence of pain, which takes a pitch-black sheen reflecting no light. Weapons made from it cannot be resisted by conventional metals. They cut through the spiritual essence of living flesh, discharging excruciating pain into the victim. The rare survivors of these weapons report levels of pain that can render a person inert for hours.": "另一项致命的发明，但不是由地精发明的，据说影子钢需要灵魂才能生产。根据传言，灵魂被用黑暗法术撕成碎片，并转化为痛苦的原始精神精华，它具有漆黑的光泽，不反射光线。用它制成的武器不能被传统的金属所抵制。它们切开活人肉体的精神精华，向受害者释放出剧烈的疼痛。这些武器的罕见幸存者报告说，其疼痛程度可以使一个人在数小时内失去活力。",
	"When weilding a weapon made of Shadow Steel, you have advantage on attack rolls made against any target wearing medium or heavy armour.

	"This venereal disease is not lethal but has indirectly caused many deaths. The Arch Daemon Sitri is said to be responsible for the appearance of this disease, hence its name. Stimulating lust to extremes, it is rumoured to have prevented city garrisons from defending the walls on several occasions, allowing fortified cities to be taken easily where a years-long siege was expected. The exact propagation vector of the disease is not known with certainty as several variants-or shades-of the disease seem to coexist, strangely appearing in a region only to spontaneously disappear some time later. Rumours have it that dark bargains are signed in the shadows to unleash the Seven Shades and trigger unrest ahead of bolder political or military moves.": "这种性病并不致命，但却间接地造成了许多人的死亡。据说大恶魔西特里（Sitri）对这种疾病的出现负有责任，因此它被称为 \"大恶魔\"。刺激欲望到了极点，据传它曾多次阻止了城市守卫者对城墙的防守，使得原本预计要围攻数年的坚固城市被轻易攻占。这种疾病的确切传播媒介并不确定，因为这种疾病的几个变种或阴影似乎并存，奇怪地出现在一个地区，一段时间后又自发地消失。有传言说，黑暗的交易是在阴影中签署的，以释放七色光，并在更大胆的政治或军事行动之前引发动乱。",
	"After prolonged physical contact with an infected creature, a humanoid must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, becoming infected with the Seven Shades of Sitri on a failed save. If a creature's saving throw is successful, they become immune to the Shades for 24 hours.": "在与被感染的生物长期接触后，人形生物必须做一个DC14的宪法救赎，如果救赎失败就会被感染上Sitri的七色光。如果一个生物的救赎成功，他们将在24小时内对七色光免疫。",

	"\"The Light of the Arch Seraphs shall protect those who truly have faith.\" This is the official statement from the Watchers of the Faithful about this virulent flu. Although not lethal, it is known to strike on a regular basis, constantly resurfacing when it was thought to be eradicated. Many rumours say that it doesn't strike equally among the populations of Etharis, sparing the followers of the the Divine Arch Seraphs and going after their enemies.": "\"大蛇夫之光将保护那些真正有信仰的人。\" 这是信众守望者对这种烈性流感的官方声明。虽然不是致命的，但众所周知，它经常发作，在被认为已经被根除的情况下不断复发。许多传言说，它在伊萨里斯的人口中并不是平等的，它放过了神圣的大蛇夫的追随者，而对他们的敌人下手。",

	"Said to have been especially designed as a poison by the Ebon Syndicate with the help of necromancers, this affliction is spread by a single drop of a particularly virulent substance, or by the bite of an infected person.": "据说这是埃邦集团在死灵法师的帮助下特别设计的一种毒药，这种痛苦通过一滴特别剧烈的物质，或者通过被感染者的咬伤而传播。",
	"It irremediably debilitates the victim rather than killing it, rendering them capable only of looking for other living beings to bite-and thus transmit the disease. The transformation takes effect in a few minutes and if not efficiently addressed-ideally by burning the affected person-the Tears can easily transform a whole town into a zombie nightmare in only a few days. The substance is only known to have been used once, in a place now known as the Cinder Circle. The confederation of archmages known in the Thaumaturge, in a rare public act, gathered to cast a powerful spell and thus reduce to ashes the entire city of Walstein that had been contaminated by the Tears. Since then, no other manifestations have been reported, but the reputation of this horrible disease has spread all over Etharis.": "它使受害者无可救药地衰弱，而不是杀死他们，使他们只能寻找其他生物来咬，从而传播疾病。这种转变在几分钟内生效，如果不有效地处理--最好是烧掉受影响的人--泪水可以在短短几天内轻易地将整个城镇变成僵尸的噩梦。人们只知道这种物质被使用过一次，在一个现在被称为煤渣圈的地方。被称为Thaumaturge的大法师联盟，在一次罕见的公开行动中，聚集在一起施展了一个强大的法术，从而将整个被眼泪污染的Walstein城化为灰烬。从那时起，没有其他表现的报道，但这种可怕的疾病的名声已经传遍了Etharis。",

	"Originating in the once prosperous city-state of Liesech, where it suddenly appeared under mysterious circumstances, the Weeping Pox is by far the worst disease ever released on Etharis. It has spread quickly through Etharis despite the attempts of the Bürach Empire to contain it to Liesech. At first a sick person will be subject to fever causing sharpened senses, overexcitement, and a sense of wellbeing. But soon these symptoms will transition to delirium, burning fever, insatiable thirst, and oozing lesions that give the illness its name. Nearly all who contract the disease die shortly after. Most people succumb to the pox in a few days, while the most resilient may hold on for almost two weeks.": "哭泣之痘起源于曾经繁荣的城邦Liesech，它在神秘的情况下突然出现，是迄今为止在Etharis发布的最糟糕的疾病。尽管比拉赫帝国试图将其控制在利塞克，但它还是在伊萨里斯迅速蔓延。起初，病人会因发烧而导致感官敏锐，过度兴奋，并有一种健康的感觉。但很快这些症状就会过渡到神志不清、发烧、饥渴难耐和渗出性病变，这就是该病的名称。几乎所有感染该病的人都会在不久后死亡。大多数人在几天内就会屈服于水痘，而最顽强的人可能会坚持将近两个星期。",
	"The Weeping Pox is transmitted between humanoids both by close contact and as an airborne virus. If a humanoid comes within 5 feet of an infected creature they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, becoming infected on a failed save.

	"Travel is a perilous endeavor in Etharis, especially at night. Even armoured merchant caravans guarded by mercenaries are reluctant to deviate from well-traveled roadways after nightfall, lest they fall prey to the unearthly creatures of the dark. Travelers who find themselves caught out after nightfall are forced to lodge at remote roadside inns for extortionate prices, and local thugs acting as guards are quick to turn away those without the coin to pay.": "在Etharis，旅行是一项危险的工作，尤其是在晚上。即使是由雇佣兵守卫的装甲商队也不愿意在夜幕降临后偏离良好的道路，以免他们成为黑暗中不知名生物的猎物。发现自己在入夜后被抓的旅行者被迫在偏远的路边旅店住宿，价格很高，而作为守卫的当地暴徒很快就会拒绝那些没有钱的人。",
	"There is one roadside tavern whose infamy exceeds all others. Found in many locations and known by many different names, it is most often called the Black Bard but denizens have come to call it The Tavern of the Lost. It is rumored that adventurers seeking the tavern cannot find it, as it only appears to those who are desperate for shelter. The warm glow of the tavern's hearth and jaunty music entice weary travelers like a sweet siren's song. Witnesses who recalled the tavern's legend and camped outside report that in the morning, all those who entered had vanished, along with the tavern.": "有一个路边酒馆的恶名超过了其他所有的酒馆。它存在于许多地方，有许多不同的名字，它最常被称为 \"黑色吟游诗人\"，但居民们都叫它 \"迷失的酒馆\"。据传闻，寻找酒馆的冒险者无法找到它，因为它只出现在那些急于寻求庇护的人面前。酒馆壁炉的温暖光芒和欢快的音乐就像甜蜜的海妖之歌一样吸引着疲惫的旅行者。回忆起酒馆传说并在外面扎营的目击者报告说，到了早上，所有进入酒馆的人都消失了，连同酒馆一起。",
	"Patrons cannot kill one another inside the tavern, where wounds spontaneously heal and severed limbs can simply be reattached. However, the tavern itself and the creatures within will certainly attempt to kill the patrons, and can do so. Unless otherwise specified, non-patron creatures will remain dead when killed.

	"The innkeeper of the Black Bard is a man of few words. He is the tavern's first victim, and has taken it upon himself to maintain the peace. Outwardly gruff, Bryn discourages adventurers from exploring the tavern beyond the common room, and is quick to quash rumors of escape attempts among his regulars. He is well aware of the dangers on the second floor and above, as adventurers get closer to discovering the wizard beyond the attic skylight. Bryn keeps an enchanted greatsword hidden behind the bar in case a fight breaks out among the patrons, and he is swift to deliver the tavern's justice. However, the greatsword fears combat, and Bryn must be quick to grab it before it makes a break toward his quarters.": "黑袍人的旅店老板是个少言寡语的人。他是酒馆的第一个受害者，并以维护和平为己任。布林外表粗暴，他不鼓励冒险者探索公共房间以外的酒馆，并迅速粉碎了常客们企图逃跑的传闻。他很清楚二楼以上的危险，因为冒险者越来越接近发现阁楼天窗外的巫师。布林把一把被施了魔法的大剑藏在吧台后面，以防顾客之间发生争斗，他也会迅速地在酒馆里伸张正义。然而，这把大剑害怕战斗，布林必须在它向他的住处逃跑之前迅速抓住它。",
