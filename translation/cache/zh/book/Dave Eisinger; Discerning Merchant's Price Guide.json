	"The Discerning Merchant's Price Guide is a tool primarily for Dungeon Masters, although players may find it useful as well, particularly in magic-heavy campaigns. Simply put, the Discerning Merchant's Price Guide is an alternate organizational tool for magic items that already exist under the rules in the D&D Fifth Edition. It provides tables for magical items in many categories: all the weapons are together, all the staffs are together, and so on, similarly to how items were laid out in 3.5e. As a DM, if I need to quickly find a sword to award a player, I want to know exactly where to look and what my options are.": "鉴别商人价格指南》主要是为地下城主提供的工具，尽管玩家也会发现它很有用，特别是在魔法密集的活动中。简而言之，《鉴别商人价格指南》是一个替代性的组织工具，适用于D&D第五版规则中已有的魔法物品。它为许多类别的魔法物品提供了表格：所有的武器都在一起，所有的法杖都在一起，等等，类似于3.5e中物品的排列方式。作为一个DM，如果我需要快速找到一把剑来奖励一个玩家，我想知道到底在哪里找，有哪些选择。",
	"It additionally provides suggested costs, attunement requirements, and other relevant details. I've found it very useful in my own campaigns, and hopefully it proves helpful to you as well.": "此外，它还提供了建议的成本、修炼要求和其他相关细节。我发现它在我自己的活动中非常有用，希望它对你也有帮助。",
	"The tables in the following pages are intended to assist in quickly finding an item of a particular type. If you're looking for a weapon, alphabetical order isn't real helpful, since they might have many different names. The actual descriptions of these items, however, are not included; those must be found in the appropriate book. Reference page numbers are provided, along with their rarity, attunement requirements, and suggested cost (rather than a simple range). Note that these prices are suggestions; feel free to adjust them as you see fit. These tables follow the rules as written; they contain no homebrew information or modifications, and almost all the suggested prices fall within the ranges suggested for items of their rarity.": "以下几页的表格是为了帮助你快速找到一个特定类型的物品。如果你要找一件武器，按字母顺序排列并没有什么帮助，因为它们可能有许多不同的名字。然而，这些物品的实际描述并不包括在内；这些描述必须在适当的书中找到。我们提供了参考页码，以及它们的稀有性、调谐要求和建议成本（而不是一个简单的范围）。请注意，这些价格是建议；请随意调整，因为你认为合适。这些表格遵循书面规则；它们不包含自制的信息或修改，而且几乎所有的建议价格都在其稀有度的物品的建议范围内。",
	"There are a few notable exceptions to rules-as-written price ranges listed in the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG). It's doubtful that any player would dish out 25,000.01 gp for a potion of storm giant strength, even though that's the minimum \"by the book\" price for a consumable legendary item. You will find that potion costs, particularly those of high rarities, have been modified. In this edition, the prices for winged boots and a broom of flying have been increased. Flying is a powerful ability, and it was absurd that these items were cheaper than a potion of flying. A potion is now the cheapest way to fly, although any character who wants to do so more than once will still find a broom, wings, or boots a more worthwhile investment. Several other items also fall outside standard price ranges, primarily because they are underpowered compared to other items of the same tier. Items with prices intentionally modified beyond the normal range for their rarity are marked with an asterisk (*).": "在《地下城管理指南》（DMG）中列出的规则价格范围中，有几个明显的例外。任何玩家都不可能拿出25,000.01金币来购买风暴巨人的药水，尽管这是可消耗传奇物品的最低 \"书本 \"价格。你会发现，药水的成本，尤其是那些高稀有度的药水，已经被修改。在这个版本中，带翅膀的靴子和飞天扫帚的价格都被提高了。飞行是一种强大的能力，而这些物品比飞行药水更便宜是很荒谬的。现在，药水是最便宜的飞行方式，尽管任何想要多次飞行的角色仍然会发现扫帚、翅膀或靴子是更值得的投资。其他一些物品也不在标准价格范围内，主要是因为它们与同级别的其他物品相比力量不足。故意将价格修改到超出其稀有性的正常范围的物品，都标有星号（*）。",
	"Magic items are naturally going to be easier to find in urban centers, but even when available in smaller settlements, residents might be reluctant to part with such treasures. While some DMs may not wish to bother with this degree of granularity, those who prefer a formulaic approach can consult the following table for a rough guide to modifying prices based on settlement size (or use it as inspiration for your own table).": "魔法物品在城市中心自然更容易找到，但即使在较小的定居点有，居民也可能不愿意放弃这些宝物。虽然有些管理员可能不希望为这种程度的细化而烦恼，但那些喜欢公式化方法的人可以参考下面的表格，以获得根据定居点大小修改价格的粗略指南（或者将其作为你自己表格的灵感）。",
