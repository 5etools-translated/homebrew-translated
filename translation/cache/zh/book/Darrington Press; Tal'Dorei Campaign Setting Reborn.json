	"Inspiration can come from anywhere: a musician's song, the advice of a close friend, or just the trust that another being places in you. In my experience, few things can compare to the surge of joy and motivation that being inspired gives.": "灵感可以来自任何地方：音乐家的歌曲，亲密朋友的建议，或者只是另一个人对你的信任。根据我的经验，很少有东西能比得上被激励所带来的喜悦和动力的澎湃。",
	"I have often found inspiration in fantasy worlds and books of adventure, mystery, and magic. I grew up devouring every novel I was handed, seeking to lose myself in the words of another mind, channeling the images they evoked in my mind into my sketchbook. But it wasn't until I discovered tabletop roleplaying games that I felt truly empowered to create my own worlds, places like the ones that I so often found myself lost in. Even better, it let me share all the ideas in my head with my friends, and they could do the same with me. I was spellbound.": "我经常在幻想世界和冒险、神秘和魔法的书籍中找到灵感。我从小就吞噬了我手中的每一本小说，寻求在另一个人的文字中迷失自己，将他们在我脑海中唤起的图像导入我的素描本。但直到我发现桌面角色扮演游戏，我才真正感到有能力创造我自己的世界，像我经常发现自己迷失在其中的地方。更妙的是，它让我与我的朋友们分享我头脑中的所有想法，而他们也可以与我做同样的事情。我被迷住了。",
	"It's been about twenty-five years since my first game. Since then, I've drawn endless inspiration from the imaginations of my friends and loved ones as we tell heroic stories around a table with dice and paper. I've found a circle of friends who share my love of dramatic storytelling, my belief that failure in games is just as exciting as success (maybe even more so), and my delight in being inspired by moments of improvisational brilliance. It's still surreal that we found a way to share that with the world; {@i Critical Role} has become a phenomenon that's surpassed my wildest dreams. Over the past few years, we've built the magical world of Exandria together, warts and all, and somehow it's become a world that millions of others have engaged with and invested their imaginations in. I hope it's inspired you to create your own adventures, stories, and joyful memories. Through Vox Machina's epic tale, the land of Tal'Dorei became a landscape rife with intrigue, conflict, and endless possibility... and we wanted to share it with you.": "从我的第一个游戏开始，已经有大约25年了。从那时起，我从我的朋友和亲人的想象力中获得了无尽的灵感，因为我们围着桌子用骰子和纸讲述英雄的故事。我找到了一个朋友圈，他们与我一样热爱戏剧性的故事，我相信游戏中的失败与成功一样令人兴奋（甚至更令人兴奋），而且我很高兴被即兴创作的辉煌时刻所激励。我们找到了一种与世界分享的方式，这仍然是超现实的；{@i Critical Role}已经成为一种现象，超过了我最疯狂的梦想。在过去的几年里，我们一起建立了神奇的埃克桑德里亚世界，不管是什么，不知不觉中，它已经成为一个让数百万人参与其中并投入想象力的世界。我希望它能激励你创造你自己的冒险、故事和欢乐的回忆。通过《Vox Machina》的史诗故事，Tal'Dorei的土地成为一个充满阴谋、冲突和无尽可能性的景观......而我们想与你分享它。",
	"Years ago, I had an opportunity to bring Tal'Dorei to the page and invite the world to tell their own stories in Exandria. The thrill of the opportunity was incredible, but the immense pressure and fear of failure (given my absolute lack of experience doing something like this) made it a strenuous journey on an incredibly short timeline. I was incredibly blessed to have become friends with the immeasurably brilliant James Haeck around that time, and I asked him to join me in this task. My good fortune found him agreeing, and with his help and inspiration, it somehow came together. With that, a limited run of the {@i {@loader Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting|collection/Matthew Mercer; TalDorei Campaign Guide.json}} went into the world.": "几年前，我有一个机会，要把塔尔多雷带到书页上，邀请世界来讲述他们自己在埃克桑德里亚的故事。这个机会的刺激是不可思议的，但巨大的压力和对失败的恐惧（鉴于我绝对缺乏做这样的事情的经验）使它成为在一个令人难以置信的短时间内的艰苦旅程。我非常幸运地在那个时候与才华横溢的詹姆斯-海克成为朋友，我请他和我一起完成这项任务。我很幸运地发现他同意了，在他的帮助和启发下，它不知不觉地就完成了。就这样，限量发行的《{@i {@loader Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting|collection/Matthew Mercer; TalDorei Campaign Guide.json}}》进入了世界。",
	"Time has passed, both in our world and within the world of Exandria. Vox Machina's greatest adventures came to a close. Looking two decades later (within Exandria), we embarked on a new adventure with the Mighty Nein in the land of Wildemount...but Vox Machina and Tal'Dorei remained deeply dear to my heart. The question arose: what would Tal'Dorei look like these two decades later? What changes would have taken place in the recovery following the Chroma Conclave and the ascension of the Whispered One? How would the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have adjusted to life after the end of their story? What dangers and threats, both old and new, would the next generation of heroes need to rise up against?": "无论是在我们的世界还是在埃克桑德里亚的世界，时间都已经过去。Vox Machina最伟大的冒险已经结束了。展望二十年后（在埃克桑德里亚），我们与强大的尼恩一起在怀尔德蒙的土地上开始了新的冒险......但《Vox Machina》和Tal'Dorei仍然深深地留在我心中。问题出现了：二十年后的Tal'Dorei会是什么样子？在 \"卓玛协约 \"和 \"低语者 \"登基后的恢复过程中会发生什么变化？在他们的故事结束后，《Vox Machina》的传奇英雄们会如何适应生活？下一代的英雄需要面对哪些新旧危险和威胁？",
	"Inspiration struck once more, and now that {@i Critical Role} had the means to do so...we needed to answer these questions for both ourselves and the numerous Critters who often conjectured as we did. \"{@book Who is on the Tal'Dorei Council?|TDCSR|3|Tal'Dorei Council}\" Well, we can finally answer that! I immediately called James Haeck back to the fray, and we were joined this time by the extraordinary mind and talents of Hannah Rose to elevate these ideas into something better than I could have hoped. Between us, Tal'Dorei was Reborn. We invite you to get lost in this world, learn of its intricacies and secrets, and, I hope, be inspired to make this world yours as well.": "灵感再次袭来，现在{@i Critical Role}有办法了......我们需要为我们自己和无数经常和我们一样猜想的动物们回答这些问题。\"{@book Who is on the Tal'Dorei Council?|TDCSR|3|Tal'Dorei Council} \"好吧，我们终于可以回答这个问题了! 我立即把詹姆斯-海克叫回战场，这次我们又有了汉娜-罗斯的非凡头脑和才能，把这些想法提升为比我希望的更好的东西。在我们之间，Tal'Dorei得到了重生。我们邀请你迷失在这个世界里，了解它的复杂性和秘密，并且，我希望，你能受到启发，使这个世界也成为你的世界。",

	"Tal'Dorei is a land of epic adventure, filled with heroes who do great deeds for love, for justice, and—maybe more often than not—for gold and their own egos. Villains are draped in shadow and draw upon the power of cruel gods—but they are just as motivated by love, their own twisted concepts of justice, and their hunger for gold, power, and glory.": "Tal'Dorei是一个史诗般的冒险之地，充满了为爱、为正义、为黄金和他们自己的自我而做出伟大事迹的英雄。恶棍们披着阴影，借助残酷的神的力量，但他们的动机同样是为了爱，为了他们自己扭曲的正义观念，为了他们对黄金、权力和荣耀的渴望。",
	"Tal'Dorei is a land created by Matthew Mercer to introduce his friends to fantasy roleplaying games, and he filled it with the greatest high fantasy tropes and played them to the hilt—and then twisted them, defying his own clichés when it would hit the hardest.": "Tal'Dorei是Matthew Mercer为了向他的朋友们介绍奇幻角色扮演游戏而创造的一块土地，他用最伟大的高级奇幻小说套路填充它，并将它们发挥到极致--然后扭曲它们，在最能打击人的时候蔑视自己的陈词滥调。",
	"This book is for Game Masters who wish to run fantasy roleplaying game campaigns set on the continent of {@i Critical Role's} first campaign, and for the players who will create characters for those games.

	"The name Tal'Dorei refers to three things throughout this book. Most often, Tal'Dorei means the continent that is home to all of the people, locations, monsters, magic items, and more within these pages. It is one of four major continents on the world of Exandria. Tal'Dorei can also mean the Republic of Tal'Dorei, the largest nation on the continent. And finally, Tal'Dorei was first the surname of a mighty hero who lent her name to the land that she helped liberate from evil.": "Tal'Dorei这个名字在本书中指的是三件事。最常见的是，Tal'Dorei指的是这片大陆，它是本书中所有人物、地点、怪物、魔法物品等的家园。它是埃克桑德里亚世界的四大大陆之一。Tal'Dorei也可以指Tal'Dorei共和国，是该大陆上最大的国家。最后，Tal'Dorei最初是一位强大的英雄的姓氏，她把自己的名字借给了她帮助从邪恶中解放出来的土地。",

	"The elementally attuned Ashari people are reclusive and dedicated to their mission of safeguarding elemental rifts across the world.

The official start of the season, however, is observed a week earlier and celebrated with games, music, and just-ripened food at the Renewal Festival. Summer brings hotter days toward the middle of Unndilar.

	"The colors change and winds cool as autumn begins in the early days of the month of Fessuran, marked by the Harvest's Close on the 3rd day.

	"The seven days of the week are named Miresen, Grissen, Whelsen, Conthsen, Folsen, Yulisen, and Da'leysen.

	"The Exandrian calendar is intentionally quite different from our own. The creation of calendars is a messy and often illogical process, with strange artifacts of their making that linger on only because of tradition—and because it would be too much of a hassle to get the entire world to change their way of counting time and days.": "埃克桑德人的日历有意与我们的日历有很大不同。日历的创造是一个混乱的、经常不合逻辑的过程，他们制造的奇怪的人工制品之所以流传下来，只是因为传统--因为要让整个世界改变他们计算时间和日子的方式太麻烦了。",
	"You don't need to bother with the Exandrian calendar in your home game. It's perfectly reasonable for you to use a nice, simple seven-day week, thirty-day month, and twelve-month year. You may even use our names for the months and the days of the week so that when an NPC tells the party to meet them at noon on \"Grissen, Misuthar 7th,\" they're basically talking about \"Tuesday, February 7th.\"": "你不需要在你的家庭游戏中使用埃克桑德里亚历法。你完全可以使用一个漂亮的、简单的七天的周、三十天的月和十二个月的年。你甚至可以用我们的名字来表示月份和星期，这样，当一个NPC告诉玩家在 \"Grissen, Misuthar 7th \"的中午与他们见面时，他们基本上就是在说 \"2月7日，星期二\"。",
	"However, if you want to immerse your players in the fantasy world of Exandria, using this unfamiliar calendar may help you on your quest.": "然而，如果你想让你的玩家沉浸在艾克桑德里亚的幻想世界中，使用这个陌生的日历可能会帮助你的探索。",
	"When the people of Tal'Dorei gaze into the morning sky, they see the sun, a blazing disc the size of a gold piece, looking back at them. It is the domain of the {@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR|Dawnfather}, a god of life and light honored politely by nearly all the realm's denizens.": "当Tal'Dorei的人们注视着清晨的天空时，他们看到太阳，一个炽热的圆盘，有金币那么大，回头看着他们。这是{@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR|Dawnfather}的领域，一个生命和光明之神，几乎所有王国的居民都会礼貌地尊重他。",
	"At night, the skies are filled with countless distant stars, a gleaming silver-white moon called Catha, and occasionally, a dim, ruddy moon called Ruidus that is nearly half Catha's size. Both moons are the domain of the {@deity The Moonweaver|Exandria|TDCSR|Moonweaver}, a capricious god of trickery and illusions, but there are sects throughout the world that believe only Catha represents the {@deity The Moonweaver|Exandria|TDCSR|Moonweaver's} cunning and grace. Catha's pearly glow is said to bless the just with cunning and caution, and to make hidden the goodhearted when they require stealth and subtlety.": "夜晚，天空中充满了无数遥远的星星，一颗闪闪发光的银白色的月亮叫Catha，偶尔也有一颗昏暗的、红润的月亮叫Ruidus，其大小几乎是Catha的一半。这两个月亮都是{@deity The Moonweaver|Exandria|TDCSR|Moonweaver}的领地，一个任性的诡计和幻觉之神，但全世界有一些教派认为只有卡塔代表{@deity The Moonweaver|Exandria|TDCSR|Moonweaver's}的狡猾和优雅。据说，卡塔的珍珠般的光芒能保佑正义者的狡猾和谨慎，并在需要隐蔽和微妙的时候让心地善良的人无所遁形。",
	"Ruidus, on the other hand, is so surrounded by disquieting rumors and folkloric tales of misfortune that some believe another unknown god or power rules this small, reddish-brown moon. Cultures around the world tell countless legends of prideful rulers who made grand plans or attempted deeds under the moon's full light—when it shines a brilliant vermilion rather than its usual ruddy color—and were forced to watch in horror as their endeavors fell to unforeseen misfortune. It is said those who fall afoul of Ruidus failed to give it the deference it is due—and so superstitious folk rarely dare to make plans while the full light of Ruidus shines above, let alone enact them.": "另一方面，Ruidus被令人不安的传言和民间的不幸故事所包围，以至于有人认为是另一个未知的神或力量在统治这个红褐色的小月亮。世界各地的文化讲述了无数关于骄傲的统治者的传说，他们在月亮的满光下--当它闪耀着灿烂的朱红色而不是通常的红润颜色--制定了宏伟的计划或试图采取行动，并被迫惊恐地看着他们的努力落入不可预知的不幸中。据说，那些触犯Ruidus的人没有给予它应有的尊重，因此迷信的人们很少敢在Ruidus的满月光照耀下制定计划，更不用说实施计划了。",
	"Worse yet, some tales forebode dark fortunes for those born under the light of a full Ruidus, a curse of ill luck that will follow them throughout their lives. Though the cruel practice of moon-sacrifice is no longer permitted in any of Tal'Dorei's cities, some far-flung settlements still secretly sacrifice children born under a full Ruidus to \"save\" them from a cursed life, and to appease the dark and unknowable appetites of the red moon.": "更糟糕的是，有些传说预示着那些在Ruidus满月之光下出生的人将有黑暗的命运，一种不吉利的诅咒将伴随他们的一生。尽管在塔尔多雷的任何一个城市都不再允许祭月的残酷做法，但一些遥远的定居点仍然秘密祭祀在Ruidus满月下出生的孩子，以 \"拯救 \"他们免受诅咒的生活，并安抚红月亮黑暗和不可知的胃口。",
	"Fortunately for the superstitious, Ruidus is rarely full. While its cousin, Catha, completes a full cycle approximately once a month, Ruidus's haunting, half-year orbit, combined with its eerie and unexplainable tendency to simply not appear in the sky on certain nights or glow with unknown light, creating an unexpected full moon, has only added to its mythic reputation as an omen of ill fortune.": "对于迷信的人来说，幸运的是Ruidus很少满月。虽然它的表弟卡塔大约每月完成一次满月周期，但Ruidus的困扰，半年的轨道，加上它的阴森和无法解释的倾向，在某些晚上根本不出现在天空中，或发出未知的光，形成一个意想不到的满月，只是增加了它作为不吉利的预兆的神话声誉。",
	"O Ruidus, grant humble chorus leave<br>To sing the song which hails the zenith of<br>Your accurséd, thrice-blessed Apotheon;<br>Remember'd best by deeds in war, and yet<br>Whose acts were driven oft by fate most foul.": "O Ruidus, grant humble chorus leave<br>To sing the song which hails the zenith of<br>Your accurséd, thrice-blessed Apotheon;<br>Remember'd best by deeds in war, and yet<br>Whose acts were driven oft by fate most foul.",

	"Though this book concerns itself mostly with the world of Exandria, and specifically the continent of Tal'Dorei, high-level adventurers may eventually gain magic that allows them to travel to other planes of existence beyond the material world in which Exandria resides.": "虽然本书主要关注的是艾克桑德里亚世界，特别是塔尔多雷大陆，但高级冒险者最终可能会获得魔法，使他们能够前往艾克桑德里亚所处的物质世界之外的其他存在空间。",
	"The planes surrounding Exandria are similar to the planes presented in fifth edition lore. Below are brief descriptions of some of the planes that a party of powerful adventurers may travel to. These planes go by many poetic and fanciful names.": "艾克桑德里亚周围的平面与第五版传说中的平面类似。以下是强大的冒险者队伍可能前往的一些平面的简要描述。这些位面有很多诗意的、富有想象力的名字。",
	"The Material Plane is a land where natural laws work as we expect. It is a place of all four elements, and of plants, animals, and minerals. Exandria is but one of many worlds on the Material Plane—though none but the most accomplished astronomers have become aware of this fact, much less devised a way of traveling between material worlds.": "物质界是一个自然法则如我们所期望的那样运作的地方。它是一个拥有所有四种元素，以及植物、动物和矿物的地方。艾克桑德里亚只是物质界众多世界中的一个--尽管除了最有成就的天文学家外，没有人意识到这个事实，更不用说设计出在物质界之间旅行的方法了。",
	"When the Protean Gods discovered Exandria, it was like a barren ship adrift in a sea of churning, chaotic elements. As a part of their creation, the elements were thrust away from the world. Some theorize that the Elemental Planes were created from this banished chaos, while others believe the elemental chaos seeped into the Material Plane from tears in the fabric of the planes.": "当普罗迪亚诸神发现埃克桑德里亚时，它就像一艘漂流在汹涌混乱的元素之海中的荒芜之船。作为他们创造的一部分，元素被推离了这个世界。一些理论认为，元素界是由这些被放逐的混沌创造出来的，而另一些理论则认为，元素的混沌从物质界的结构中的裂缝渗入物质界。",
	"The latter may be more likely, as rifts between the Elemental Planes can be found across Exandria. The largest of these rifts are tended to by the four Ashari civilizations, and any who gaze within find wild wastelands of pure elemental power: roiling seas of fire, towering mountains of gnashing stone, infinite skies filled with cloud-top settlements, and endless, stormy oceans of water.": "后者可能更有可能，因为整个艾克桑德里亚都能发现元素界的裂缝。其中最大的裂缝由四个阿沙里文明负责，任何注视着这些裂缝的人都会发现纯粹的元素力量的荒芜之地：咆哮的火海、高耸的咬牙切齿的石头山、充满云顶定居点的无限天空，以及无尽的暴风雨般的水海洋。",
	"Parallel to Exandria are odd reflections of its reality. The Fey Realm is a plane of natural beauty and ferocity, inhabited by fey folk. The Plane of Shadow is a dour, sinister mirror of the world that is. And the Ethereal Plane is a hazy film across the material world, as if it were viewed through an old, cloudy mirror, inhabited not only by restless spirits, but also by predators that target those who cling to the world of the living.": "与埃克桑德里亚平行的是其现实的奇特反映。翡冷翠是一个充满自然美和凶残的平面，由翡冷翠人居住。阴影位面是世界的一面阴郁、险恶的镜子。而空灵界是横跨物质世界的一层朦胧的薄膜，就像通过一面古老的、多云的镜子来看一样，不仅居住着不安分的灵魂，而且还有针对那些依附于生命世界的掠夺者。",
	"All the prior planes exist directly adjacent to the Material Plane, buttressing and occasionally co-mingling with its inhabitants. All the planes that follow are separated from the material world by a vast sea of starlight, barren asteroids, and misty nebulae of unpredictable magic. In the ancient past, arcanists had to craft vessels to sail the treacherous sea of stars to travel between their home plane and the mysterious Outer Planes.": "所有之前的星球都直接与物质界相邻，与物质界的居民相依为命，偶尔也会混合在一起。接下来的所有位面都与物质世界隔开，被浩瀚的星光之海、荒芜的小行星和虚无缥缈的星云组成的不可预知的魔法所阻隔。在古代，奥术师们不得不制作船只，在险恶的星海中航行，以往返于他们的母体位面和神秘的外星位面。",
	"These days, magic such as the plane shift spell has allowed planar travelers to bypass these methods, but there are still a number of strange creatures and forgotten, imprisoned demigods who float eternally through the Cosmic Sea.": "这些天来，诸如平面转换法术之类的魔法使平面旅行者能够绕过这些方法，但仍有一些奇怪的生物和被遗忘、被囚禁的半神在宇宙海中永恒地漂浮。",
	"The {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} imprisoned the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} in prison planes after the {@book Founding|TDCSR|2|The Founding}, and retired to planes of their own creation after the {@book Divergence|TDCSR|2|The Divergence}. Over time, the divine beings on these planes reshaped their new homes in their own image, creating places where natural laws don't function as one native to the Material Plane might expect.": "在{@book Founding|TDCSR|2|The Founding}之后，{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities}将{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}囚禁在监狱平面，而在{@book Divergence|TDCSR|2|The Divergence}之后，则退居到他们自己创造的平面。随着时间的推移，这些星球上的神灵按照自己的形象重塑了他们的新家，创造了一些自然法则并不像物质世界的人所期望的那样运作的地方。",
	"All of these planes are strongly aligned to one or more cosmic principles of good, evil, law, and chaos, based on the divine powers that reside there. Because of the Divine Gate established after the {@book Divergence|TDCSR|2|The Divergence}, no divine powers can depart these planes, for the sake of all Creation. The gods' supernatural creations can pass through the Divine Gate, though the more powerful they grow—and thus, the closer they come to divinity—the harder it is for them to pass through. However, mortals and lesser supernatural beings who possess magic to travel between the planes can travel to and from Outer Planes like the Hells, the Abyss, Elysium, and Pandemonium unhindered by the Divine Gate.": "所有这些位面都根据居住在那里的神力，与一个或多个宇宙的善、恶、法律和混乱的原则紧密结合。由于{@book Divergence|TDCSR|2|The Divergence}之后建立的神门，为了所有的创造物，没有神力可以离开这些位面。诸神的超自然创造物可以通过神门，尽管它们越是强大--因此，它们越是接近神性--它们就越难通过。然而，凡人和拥有魔法的较小的超自然生物可以在各平面之间旅行，来往于外部平面，如地狱、深渊、极乐世界和大魔界，而不受神门的阻挠。",
	"Far beyond even the divine Outer Planes is a realm where all laws of nature break down completely. Mortal senses have no way of properly perceiving the nature of these far-distant realms, and most minds that try to comprehend them snap under the strain of so much unfamiliar stimulus. These maddening realities and the alien horrors that live within them are mercifully kept away from the known multiverse by the unimaginable distance of space.": "甚至在神圣的外星界之外，是一个所有自然法则都完全崩溃的领域。凡人的感官无法正确感知这些遥远领域的本质，大多数试图理解它们的头脑在如此多的陌生刺激下崩溃。这些令人抓狂的现实和生活在其中的外星恐怖，被不可想象的空间距离仁慈地挡在已知的多元宇宙之外。",
	"Some creatures of the beyond have lurked on the Material Plane since ancient times, perhaps at the invitation of the {@deity The Chained Oblivion|Exandria|TDCSR|Chained Oblivion} itself, or because the divine powers unleashed in the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity} punched holes in time and space that allowed such aberrations to slither into Exandria unimpeded.": "自古以来，一些超凡的生物就潜伏在物质界，也许是应{@deity The Chained Oblivion|Exandria|TDCSR|Chained Oblivion}本身的邀请，或者是因为{@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity}中释放的神力在时间和空间上打了洞，让这些反常的东西不受阻碍地溜进埃克桑德里亚。",

	"Where did Tal'Dorei come from? The origin of this land is a time-shrouded question that everyone has pondered in some way, from the most exalted, world-traveling hero to the common farmer who has never traveled three miles beyond their village. Everyone has their own ideas on where Tal'Dorei, and all of the wide world of Exandria, came from. These varied thoughts all have some things in common, since they are all born of jumbled misunderstandings of ancient myths told orally from bard to bard, then passed from father to daughter, and eventually codified into religious re-writings of history that favor the teachings of a given deity.": "Tal'Dorei是从哪里来的？这片土地的起源是一个被时间掩盖的问题，每个人都以某种方式思考过这个问题，从最崇高的、环游世界的英雄到从未走出过村庄三英里的普通农民。每个人都有自己的想法，知道塔尔多雷以及艾克桑德里亚这个广阔的世界是从哪里来的。这些不同的想法都有一些共同点，因为它们都是由吟游诗人口头讲述的古代神话的杂乱无章的误解而产生的，然后由父亲传给女儿，最终被编入有利于特定神灵教义的宗教历史重写本。",

These two organizations have assembled this history by digging beneath the layers of dust and decay that hide battles long past, unearthing texts long thought burned and censored, and exhuming historical treasures from tombs of heroes long forgotten. The details are often debated, for the question of the land's origin remains—consuming the curious, calling those hungry for purpose, and fueling the business of adventuring to delve into the tantalizing unknown places of the world.": "说出一个完整而准确的塔尔多雷的真相是一项不可能的任务，然而塔尔多雷却以创造出经常做不可能的事情的人而闻名。以下是《艾克桑德里亚的神话》，它是根据塔尔多雷最重要的学者--(1%)的本土{@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|4|5.

	"Before the history of the lands of Tal'Dorei can be explored, its context in the history of Exandria itself must be thoroughly established. The world of Exandria is home to four major continents, dozens of nations, and untold tiny pockets of civilization amid a wondrous, dangerous wilderness. Every civilization, from the largest empire to the tiniest nomadic clan, has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with history, but there is no known definitive story.": "在探索Tal'Dorei土地的历史之前，必须彻底确定它在Exandria历史中的背景。艾克桑德里亚世界有四大洲，几十个国家，以及在奇妙而危险的荒野中的数不清的小块文明。每个文明，从最大的帝国到最微小的游牧部族，都有自己对其故事开始地点的解释。即使在埃克桑德里亚的世界里，不同的文化也有最终与历史相融合的创世神话，但并没有已知的明确故事。",

Vasselheim became Exandria's oldest surviving city by virtue of not just being built long ago, but by enduring the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity} (which shall be elucidated presently), a miraculous feat that few other charted settlements can claim to have accomplished.": "即便如此，生活中还是不断地寻求对其初始的理解。在这份报告中，{@book Cobalt Soul|TDCSR|3|Library of the Cobalt Soul}和{@book Emon's|TDCSR|4|Emon, the City of Fellowship}{@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|4|5.

	"In short, Vasselheim houses the earliest known temples to the gods, and the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophe. It is these sources that this joint research initiative treats as its primary documents, though great effort has been made to corroborate their claims through later sources.

	"From the divine hands of the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart} sprung forth the First Children, the {@book elves|TDCSR|5|elves}. It is thought that they were made in their creator's image, yet it is just as likely that the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}, and all the gods who shared their ideas with them, actually adopted forms inspired by the image of their creations. The First Children walked the lush Green and gazed upon the heavenly Blue as the gods tamed Primordial Creation around them.": "从{@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}的神手中诞生了第一批孩子，{@book elves|TDCSR|5|elves}。人们认为他们是按照创造者的形象制造的，但同样可能的是，{@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}和所有与他们分享想法的神灵，实际上采用了他们创造的形象所激发的形式。当诸神在他们周围驯服原始创造物时，最初的孩子们走在郁郁葱葱的绿地上，凝视着天堂般的蓝色。",
	"Not long after, in the scale of the cosmos, a second mortal creation was wrought by the divine {@deity The All-Hammer|Exandria|TDCSR|All-Hammer}: the {@book dwarves|TDCSR|5|dwarves}, a hearty people imbued with the desire to continue the gods' work—taming a primordial world filled with the craft and invention of the divinity that lay beyond the ashen void. In their turn, a third people were given life by the passionate lovers of Order and Chaos, the {@deity The Lawbearer|Exandria|TDCSR|Lawbearer} and the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother}. Their children were the {@book humans|TDCSR|5|humans}, endowed with hearts of passion to bring meaning to the world as it assumed an orderly form.

	"As a note from the High Curator of {@book Emon's|TDCSR|4|Emon, the City of Fellowship} Cobalt Reserve, the chronicle of Vasselheim states that the gods were given form and name only when the peoples of Exandria began to worship them—yet many of the various races of the world ascribe their creation to a single god or group of gods. It would be remiss to not at least conjecture that while the Protean Gods lacked distinct form, they still had unique thoughts, emotions, and motivations that were later codified through the worship of the people.": "作为{@book Emon's|TDCSR|4|Emon, the City of Fellowship}钴储备的高级馆长的说明，瓦塞尔海姆的编年史指出，只有当埃克桑德里亚的人民开始崇拜他们的时候，诸神才被赋予了形式和名称--然而世界上的许多不同种族都把他们的创造归功于一个单一的神或一群神。如果不至少猜测一下，虽然普罗迪亚诸神缺乏明显的形式，但他们仍有独特的思想、情感和动机，后来通过人们的崇拜而被编入法典，那就是失职了。",
	"As inspiration flowed from the Protean Gods, other creations followed, giving life to Exandria's many peoples. Here the mythic record of Vasselheim grows unclear, for while the {@book elves|TDCSR|5|elves}, {@book dwarves|TDCSR|5|dwarves}, and {@book humans|TDCSR|5|humans} were undeniably Exandria's first races, the identities of the many Children of Creation that followed were left unrecorded by the Dawn City's chroniclers.": "随着普罗迪亚诸神的灵感涌现，其他的创造物也接踵而至，使埃克桑德里亚的许多民族获得了生命。在这里，瓦塞尔海姆的神话记录变得不明确了，因为虽然{@book elves|TDCSR|5|elves}、{@book dwarves|TDCSR|5|dwarves}和{@book humans|TDCSR|5|humans}不可否认是埃克桑德里亚的第一批种族，但后来许多创世之子的身份却没有被黎明之城的编年史家记录下来。",
	"These myriad young races explored their freshly founded world. As their knowledge grew, they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the lives of the children were extinguished mercilessly by the still-chaotic world. Sorrow is said to have filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against a land that rebuked them. The gods ultimately lent their children tiny fragments of their own power, gifts with which they might shape the world around them.": "这些无数的年轻种族探索着他们新建立的世界。随着他们知识的增长，他们试图进行建设。但这块土地凶猛而奸诈，孩子们的生命被这个仍然混乱的世界无情地扼杀了。据说，当众神看着他们的孩子与这片斥责他们的土地抗争时，他们的心中充满了悲哀。众神最终将自己的力量的微小碎片借给了他们的孩子，他们可以用这些礼物塑造他们周围的世界。",
	"This small mercy of the gods was the birth of magic, and with it the people of Exandria learned to bend the angry earth to their will, to temper the wrath of its explosive mountains, to tame its unyielding floods, and to make the hard earth soft and bountiful. Wandering peoples settled, language became commonplace, survival gave way to art, and governance replaced anarchy. The Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good—but fragile, and in need of guardians.": "诸神的这一小小的怜悯是魔法的诞生，随着魔法的诞生，艾克桑德里亚的人们学会了让愤怒的大地屈服于他们的意志，缓和其爆炸性山脉的愤怒，驯服其不屈的洪水，并使坚硬的大地变得柔软和富饶。流浪的人们定居下来，语言变得普遍，生存让位于艺术，管理取代了无政府状态。保护神创造者，灰暗天空之外的神性，看到了进步，看到了它是好的，但也是脆弱的，需要守护者。",
	"Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Tal'Dorei. These Protectors pledged themselves to defend the weak against tyrants. It is here that the mythic tales connect to the oldest, most fragmented passages of recorded history as civilization's reach stretched across the world. The people praised the gods for their newfound safety, and their prayers gave them forms, names, and purpose.": "因此，第一批保护者诞生了：Tal'Dorei的龙族金属人。这些保护者发誓要保护弱者，反对暴君。正是在这里，神话故事与最古老、最零散的历史记录相连接，因为文明的触角延伸到了世界各地。人们为他们新发现的安全而赞美神灵，他们的祈祷给了他们形式、名字和目的。",
	"Yet the realm refused to be tamed. Quaking cliffs roared in defiance of mortalkind's magical gifts. Seas swelled and seethed. Flames erupted from below with greater intensity than any had seen before. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who were born in the primeval chaos of the world the gods had found: the Primordials. These elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the land now rose from their unseen domain to sunder it once more. The gods watched as their children were crushed between gnashing rocks and fed to formless terrors unleashed in the wake of the destruction. Thus were the seeds of Exandria's greatest cataclysm set into motion.": "然而，这个王国拒绝被驯服。颤抖的悬崖咆哮着，无视凡人的魔法天赋。海水涌动着，沸腾着。火焰从下面爆发出来，其强度超过以往任何时候。在这些元素之下，在灰暗的天空之外，创造者们不知道，在诸神发现的世界的原始混沌中诞生的古老生命：原始人。这些曾经居住在土地深处的元素巨头，现在从他们看不见的领域中升起，再次将土地分裂。诸神看着他们的孩子被压在咬碎的岩石之间，并被喂给在毁灭之后释放出来的无形的恐怖。就这样，艾克桑德里亚最大的灾难的种子开始萌发。",
	"Some gods were so full of grief and anger that they wished to abandon this world for another. They tried to convince their divine kindred to join the Primordials in reclaiming the realm for chaos, so that they could move on to start anew. Others wished to prove they could tame the world for their beloved children. This caused a divide among the gods. The schismatic deities, known today as the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}, joined their songs and swords to those of chaos and destruction, taking and twisting their children into the image of their intent.": "一些神灵充满了悲伤和愤怒，他们希望放弃这个世界而去另一个世界。他们试图说服他们的神族加入原始人的行列，为混沌世界开垦，这样他们就可以继续前进，重新开始。其他人则希望证明他们可以为他们心爱的孩子驯服这个世界。这引起了众神之间的分歧。分裂的神灵，今天被称为{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}，将他们的歌声和剑与那些混乱和毁灭的歌声和剑结合起来，将他们的孩子带入并扭曲成他们意图的形象。",
	"The cosmos itself seemed to recognize the magnitude of the battle on Exandria, and beings of Order and Chaos spilled forth from the still-young multiverse. Creatures of chaos emerged from a formless void that Exandria's peoples came to call the Abyss.": "宇宙本身似乎认识到了埃克桑德里亚之战的规模，秩序和混沌的生物从仍然年轻的多元宇宙中涌现出来。混乱的生物从一个无形的虚空中出现，埃克桑德里亚的人们称之为深渊。",
	"These demons fed upon the suffering of the wounded and the dying, and grew cruel. Sentinels of order emerged from a distant realm of celestial harmony. The {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} beseeched these celestials to aid them. In turn, the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} forced order upon the demons and made them devils, perfectly lawful soldiers who lived only to cause harm.": "这些恶魔以受伤和垂死的人的痛苦为食，越来越残忍。秩序的哨兵从遥远的天体和谐领域出现了。{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} 恳求这些天人帮助他们。反过来，(1%)的人强迫恶魔遵守秩序，使他们成为魔鬼，成为完全合法的士兵，只为造成伤害而活着。",
	"As the clash of gods and Primordials spiraled out of control, the desperate mortal races sought their own way to defend themselves from the rebellious elements. Seeing that their creations still suffered, the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart} taught them the secrets of making magic themselves. The most intelligent and inquisitive mortal minds followed the path the gods had revealed to them, and created incantations and formulae to create new spells on their own terms, without the aid of divine power. These people called themselves arcanists, for they were masters of the arcane secrets of magic.": "随着诸神和原始人的冲突失控，绝望的凡人种族寻求自己的方式来抵御反叛的元素。看到他们的创造物仍在受苦，{@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}教他们自己制造魔法的秘密。最聪明和最有好奇心的凡人沿着神灵启示的道路，创造了咒语和公式，以自己的方式创造新的法术，而无需神力的帮助。这些人自称为奥术师，因为他们是魔法奥秘的大师。",
	"With their potent new magics, these resourceful mortals subdued the Primordials long enough for the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} to banish their traitorous kin to secluded prison planes. With the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} locked away, the gods were overjoyed to see the resourcefulness of their children. The defeated Primordials were destroyed, and from their ever-enduring essences, the gods channeled their wild and destructive powers into the Elemental Planes that surround the material world of Exandria.": "凭借他们强大的新魔法，这些足智多谋的凡人制服了原始人，足以让{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities}将他们的叛徒亲属驱逐到隐蔽的监狱平面。随着(1%)被关起来，诸神看到他们的孩子们的机智，感到非常高兴。被打败的原始人被消灭了，从他们永恒的精华中，诸神将他们狂野的破坏性力量引导到环绕艾克桑德里亚物质世界的元素界。",
	"For the first time since the Creation, Exandria finally settled into an idyllic peace. From this peace was born the first enduring mortal civilization, the heart of which was a grand city called Vasselheim, the Cradle of Creation and the Dawn City.": "自创世以来，埃克桑德里亚终于第一次进入了田园牧歌式的和平。从这种和平中诞生了第一个持久的凡人文明，其核心是一个名为瓦塞尔海姆的宏伟城市，创造的摇篮和黎明之城。",
	"Culture developed anew, the races ventured beyond to explore and discover their own lands, and great music filled the air to give name to this world once and for all: Exandria.": "文化得到了新的发展，各种族冒险去探索和发现他们自己的土地，伟大的音乐充斥着空气，为这个世界永远地命名。艾克桑德里亚。",
	"The foremost scholars of our day would make it seem an indisputable fact that the gods created Exandria. That they blessed us with the bounty that all peoples of the world now make use of. So too, they say, was magic their gift to us. But such zealots ignore the fact that there is another likelihood: that the gods did not create mortals, and their world—but the opposite. That the dreams of mortals mingled in the wild magic of the young world, and gave that magic form and order: divinity. Of course, the dogmatic zealots of our day will dismiss such ideas as heresy—but not you, reader! The avid mind feeds not on dogma, but on new ideas!": "我们这个时代最重要的学者会使众神创造了埃克桑德里亚成为一个无可争议的事实。他们用世界上所有的人现在都在使用的财物来保佑我们。他们说，魔法也是他们送给我们的礼物。但这些狂热者忽略了另一个可能性：诸神没有创造凡人和他们的世界，而是相反。凡人的梦想混入了年轻世界的狂野魔法中，并赋予了这种魔法以形式和秩序：神性。当然，我们这个时代的教条主义狂热者会把这种想法视为异端，但不是你，读者！狂热者的思想不以任何东西为食。狂热的心灵不是以教条为食，而是以新的想法为食！你的想法是什么？",
	"Ages passed, and society flourished. Great kingdoms sprung up. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power. Even though magic could be used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new forms of life and power.": "岁月流逝，社会繁荣。伟大的王国兴起了。城堡在一天之内建成，这是由奥术师新发现的力量加速的。尽管魔法可以被用来以前所未有的速度完成最困难的任务，但魔法使用者一直在努力创新。随着法师们练习和完善他们的创造能力，他们很快就解开了生命本身的秘密，诞生了奇妙的、危险的新生命和力量形式。",
	"Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the very magic which allowed mortalkind to prosper also instilled a deep rot within their civilizations. The arcanists of the world grew arrogant. They came to see their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, and that with a sophisticated enough command of magic, they could become as powerful as the gods themselves. Though this hurt and surprised the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} who had imprisoned their kin for the sake of their children, they sought to sympathize with the willfulness of their creations, remaining out of love and hoping that the mortals would learn the error of their ways.": "然而，事后看来，很明显，使凡人得以繁荣的魔法也在他们的文明中灌输了深深的腐朽。世界上的奥术师变得傲慢无礼。他们把自己的奥术天赋看作是诸神对他们的命运无能为力的证明，只要对魔法的掌握足够成熟，他们就能变得和诸神一样强大。尽管这让那些为了他们的孩子而囚禁了他们的亲属的（%0%）人感到痛苦和惊讶，但他们试图同情他们的创造物的任性，出于爱而留下，并希望凡人能够学会他们的错误。",
	"The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty, but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Rather than universal goodwill and comfort for all, the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|2|Age of Arcanum} came to be defined by endless petty squabbles over wealth and power among the elite, while those without magic hunted for their scraps. Tantalizing rumors of a path to immortality slithered through the most decadent circles of magi and nobility. One mortal mage, her name lost and presumed to be struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making of her the first and only living mortal to ascend. The name of this original death god was likewise lost to history. Only the title of his now-godly successor, the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens}, survives.": "奥术的出现似乎是通往富足时代的关键，但也被证明是对它的威胁，因为繁荣很快让位于贪婪。与普遍的善意和所有人的舒适相比，{@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|2|Age of Arcanum}的定义是精英阶层对财富和权力无休止的争吵，而那些没有魔法的人则在猎取他们的残羹剩饭。关于长生不老之路的诱人传言在最颓废的魔法师和贵族圈子里流传。一个凡人法师，她的名字已经丢失，被认为已经从历史中抹去，她制作了现在被禁止的仪式来挑战死神，杀死了他并在万神殿中占据了他的位置，使她成为第一个也是唯一一个活着的凡人升天。这位最初的死神的名字也同样消失在历史中。只有他现在的神的继任者的头衔，即{@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens}，得以保留。",
	"Her victory over divinity was a catalyst for many of the horrors of the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|2|Age of Arcanum}. An archmage named Vespin Chloras, renowned throughout ancient Vasselheim for his wealth, skill, and cruelty, was inspired by this display. He sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the Betrayers into the mortal world.": "她对神性的胜利是许多{@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|2|Age of Arcanum}恐怖事件的催化剂。一位名叫维斯平-克洛拉斯的大法师因其财富、技能和残忍而闻名于整个古代瓦塞尔海姆，他受到了这次展示的启发。他寻求被放逐的诸神的指导和力量，撕开了他们的监狱之门，将背叛者释放到凡间。",
	"In their imprisonment, these Gods of Hatred and Despair had warped their prisons into reflections of their depravity. The Abyss, once a formless place of chaos, a byproduct of the gods' Creation, was twisted into a place of evil. Countless other planes of cruelty were born from the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} hatred, and those realms' evil depths endlessly churned forth horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed.": "在他们的监禁中，这些仇恨和绝望之神将他们的监狱扭曲成了他们堕落的反映。深渊，曾经是一个无形的混沌之地，是诸神创造的副产品，被扭曲成了一个邪恶的地方。无数其他残忍的星球从{@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}的仇恨中诞生，而这些领域的邪恶深处无休止地涌现出恐怖，它们活着只是为了将和平变成痛苦，将正义变成傲慢和贪婪。",
	"Released unto the mortal world once more, the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} urge to ruin was supplanted by the desire to dominate, and they turned their sights first to the archmage who had freed them, making Vespin the first of their many mortal thralls.

	"In this land, where the twisted power of the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} corrupted planes seeped into the world, the lords of evil welcomed mortals whose heartlessness and lust for power made them susceptible to the gods' grand promises. The most fertile soil of all for these noxious seeds lay in mortal hearts obsessed with the infinite power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} soon made their presence known to the world with a surprise assault on Vasselheim itself.": "在这片土地上，腐朽星球的扭曲力量渗入了这个世界，邪恶的领主们欢迎那些无情和对权力的欲望使他们容易受到诸神宏大承诺的影响的凡人。这些有毒的种子最肥沃的土壤在于凡人的心，他们痴迷于奥术的无限力量。有了被诅咒者军团的支持，{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}很快就以对瓦塞尔海姆的突然袭击而让世界知道了他们的存在。",
	"Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of their protectors, the metallic dragons, and even a number of the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} themselves. The creators descended to trade blows with their former brethren. The battle, which pitted gods against mortals and heroes against demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights, until the dark forces were forced to retreat, their surprise attack thwarted.": "虽然城市的大部分都变成了废墟，但瓦塞尔海姆还是经受住了最初的攻击，在他们的保护者、金属龙、甚至一些{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities}自己的干预下得以保存。创造者们降临，与他们以前的兄弟们交手。这场让诸神与凡人、英雄与恶魔对峙的战斗，在二十个日夜里无休止地进行着，直到黑暗势力被迫撤退，他们的突袭被挫败。",
	"Yet this victory was a tainted one. Evil had been repulsed momentarily, but the revelation of such a terrible foe incited an arcane arms race. Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}, who could be true allies? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of divinity, what value did mortal lives hold? Fearing all powers but their own, the most self-interested and singular human arcanists warped their greatest creations, magical instruments of prosperity and joy, into arms and armor of horrific power. The {@book dwarves'|TDCSR|5|dwarves} fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed further into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. {@book Elves|TDCSR|5|elves} used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never before seen.": "然而，这个胜利是一个有污点的胜利。邪恶暂时被击退了，但这样一个可怕的敌人的出现激起了一场神秘的军备竞赛。信任被无限期地打破了：如果凡人都能在{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}的摆布下堕落，谁还能成为真正的盟友？如果这样的毁灭可以在神的注视下被释放出来，那么凡人的生命还有什么价值？由于害怕除了自己的力量之外的所有力量，最利己和最单一的人类奥术师将他们最伟大的创造物，即繁荣和欢乐的魔法工具，扭曲成具有恐怖力量的武器和盔甲。当他们进一步钻进山里时，对岩石和泥土的迷恋转向了与世隔绝，利用他们的神圣天赋，使自主的巨兽军团复活，以保护他们的祖先大厅。{@book Elves|TDCSR|5|elves}利用他们对造物之美的理解和错综复杂的关系，编织出具有难以想象的破坏力的法术，这是埃克桑德里亚以前从未见过的。",
	"For the first time since the awakening of the Primordials, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity}.": "自从原始人觉醒以来，第一次魔法的焦点是战争。诸神自己也同意在战场上加入他们的孩子，从天而降，再次拿起武器参加现在被称为（%0%）的战争。",
	"Few records remain of the terrible war that followed, but its effects are still felt today.

Others imbued fragments of their power into the weapons now called {@book Vestiges of Divergence|TDCSR|6|Vestiges of Divergence}. More still bestowed blessings upon mortals and called them champions. One tale even tells of a champion blessed by three of the gods in their times of greatest need.

	"The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the ensuing battles of gods and mortals frayed the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world and bringing utter annihilation. Even the ley lines that direct the flow of magic across Exandria like veins direct blood through the body show signs of being warped by the raw power that the Calamity unleashed. Some well-preserved ruins of the ancient civilizations remain, such as the Drowned City of Cael Morrow in the lands of {@book Marquet|TDCSR|4|Marquet}, but for the most part, all traces of the old world were erased from the face of Exandria.": "在随后的神与凡人的战斗中，所释放的能量之大，使挡住元素混乱的界限变得模糊不清，将肆无忌惮的毁灭洒向世界，带来彻底的毁灭。甚至连引导整个艾克桑德里亚的魔法流动的雷线，就像血管引导血液通过身体一样，也有被灾变释放的原始力量扭曲的迹象。一些保存完好的古代文明遗迹依然存在，例如位于{@book Marquet|TDCSR|4|Marquet}地区的凯尔-莫罗(Cael Morrow)淹没之城，但在大多数情况下，旧世界的所有痕迹都从埃克桑德里亚的脸上抹去了。",
	"So great was the loss of life during the war that even liberal estimates suggest no more than a third of Exandria's population survived it. This unthinkable devastation inspired some civilizations to flee Exandria entirely and seek refuge on other planes, scattering the Children of Creation across the multiverse. By the war's end, the only bastion of civilization left on the face of Exandria was the Dawn City itself: Vasselheim.": "战争期间的生命损失是如此之大，以至于即使是自由估计，也没有超过三分之一的埃克桑德里亚的人口能够幸存下来。这种难以想象的破坏激发了一些文明完全逃离埃克桑德里亚，并在其他星球上寻求庇护，使创造之子分散在整个多元宇宙。在战争结束时，艾克桑德里亚表面上唯一的文明堡垒只剩下了黎明之城本身。Vasselheim。",
	"In the wake of the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity}, the victorious {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} once more banished their traitorous kin to their realms of deception and hate.

However, beyond hearing news of Vox Machina's involvement in this conflict, few in Tal'Dorei were concerned by rumblings on the other side of the world.": "在{@book Chroma Conclave's|TDCSR|2|The Chroma Conclave}战败后的一年，世界被一场骚乱所困扰，因为一个巫师试图一举成神并粉碎瓦塞尔海姆的黎明之城。他的成功将意味着物质世界的灾难，让他成为世界上不可逾越的神门这边唯一的神。然而，除了听到沃克斯-马奇纳参与这场冲突的消息外，在塔尔多雷，很少有人关心世界另一端的隆隆声。",
	"Though the lich's defeat confined him to a remote demiplane, there is no way to strip him of his stolen divinity.

	"A generation has passed in relative peace. Yet all who have studied history know that each age's conflict sows the seeds of the next. The Republic of Tal'Dorei has proven it can prosper in peacetime, but it has yet to be tested by the pressures of war or a supernatural cataclysm.": "一代人在相对和平中过去了。然而所有研究过历史的人都知道，每个时代的冲突都会为下一个时代播下种子。塔尔多雷共和国已经证明它可以在和平时期繁荣发展，但它还没有受到战争或超自然灾难的压力的考验。",
	"After two decades of expensive reconstruction and princely investments in {@item skyship|TDCSR} moorings, the Republic of Tal'Dorei is deeply indebted to arcanists across the land. Chief among them is the {@book League of Miracles|TDCSR|3|League of Miracles}, a consortium of thaumaturgists who have claimed untold fortunes from reconstruction bounties all over the country.": "经过20年昂贵的重建和对{@item skyship|TDCSR}停泊点的巨额投资，塔尔多雷共和国深深地欠下了全国各地奥术师的债。其中最主要的是{@book League of Miracles|TDCSR|3|League of Miracles}，一个由泰玛特人组成的财团，他们从全国各地的重建悬赏中获得了数不清的财富。",
	"The simple fact is that the cost of rebuilding Tal'Dorei was far more than the council or local leaders could afford to pay. Far be it from the {@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|4|5. Alabaster Lyceum} to cast aspersions on so beneficial an organization, but there are fears among the Tal'Dorei people that the league has already begun to collect on what they are owed in forms other than gold, as more and more league mages receive preferential treatment from local margraves and even members of the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|3|Tal'Dorei Council} itself.": "一个简单的事实是，重建Tal'Dorei的费用远远超过了议会或当地领导人的支付能力。如果（%0%）对如此有益的组织进行诽谤，那是不可能的，但在塔尔多雷人中，人们担心联盟已经开始以黄金以外的形式收取他们所欠的款项，因为越来越多的联盟法师从当地的边缘人甚至是（%1%）本身的成员那里得到优惠待遇。",

His hellfire left marks on the land that will never heal—magical wounds that bleed fire and ooze chaotic magic. Smaller cities beyond the reach of the council have begun to succumb to sinister influences. Demons and devils crawl into the world, summoned by occult powers answering fell voices from beyond the Divine Gate. The {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} sense weakness within the world.

	"Yet despite these threats, the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have largely set down their blades, guns, and spells and taken up the mantle of leadership.

	"Tal'Dorei was nearly destroyed when the gods fought one another in the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity}.

	"However, there are a number of cults who yearn to circumvent this barrier and summon their dark patron onto the Material Plane. Others still seek to unravel the forgotten rites of ascension, just as the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens} did in ancient times—just as {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR} did in living memory. What would happen if an omnipotent deity somehow managed to arise on the mortal side of the Divine Gate? Or even simply managed to fool the gods into thinking they had done so?

	"Game Masters can also use political elements to flavor or provide a backdrop for their otherwise action-focused games. On a smaller scale, corrupt margraves may hire bandits to pillage their own villages, requiring heroes to step in. On a broader scale, a threat to the stability of the Republic of Tal'Dorei itself may force the characters to stop a megalomaniac bent on conquering the republic from within.": "游戏管理员还可以使用政治元素来为他们以行动为重点的游戏调味或提供一个背景。在较小的范围内，腐败的边缘人可能会雇佣强盗来掠夺他们自己的村庄，需要英雄们介入。在更大的范围内，对塔尔多雷共和国本身稳定的威胁可能会迫使角色们去阻止一个一心想从内部征服共和国的自大狂。",
	"A criminal syndicate known as the {@book Clasp|TDCSR|3|The Clasp} has lurked in Tal'Dorei's underworld since the foundation of the old Tal'Dorei Empire.

The enigmatic {@book Grey Hunters|TDCSR|4|Grey Hunters}, the secretive elite warriors of the {@book Chamber of Whitestone|TDCSR|3|Chamber of Whitestone}, have worked tirelessly to pull out the {@book Remnants|TDCSR|3|The Remnants} by their roots, but permanently eliminating them seems an impossible task.": "黛利拉夫人和西拉斯-布里伍德勋爵是{@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}的前邪教领袖，20多年前被赶出了{@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}。虽然他们已经不在了，但他们所犯下的罪恶仍然挥之不去。他们统治{@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}的近六年时间里，消耗了人民的生命和希望。虽然家园已经重建，布里亚尔森林的不死怪兽已经被根除，但吸血鬼的恐怖统治所带来的创伤将持续几代人。一些{@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}的人受到了深刻的影响，以至于他们自己转向了亡灵魔法和吸血鬼，并逃到了{@book Alabaster Sierras|TDCSR|4|Alabaster Sierras}，学习布里亚尔森林的邪恶魔法的秘密--模仿他们对{@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}的接管。神秘的{@book Grey Hunters|TDCSR|4|Grey Hunters}，{@book Chamber of Whitestone|TDCSR|3|Chamber of Whitestone}的秘密精英战士，一直孜孜不倦地将{@book Remnants|TDCSR|3|The Remnants}连根拔起，但永久地消灭他们似乎是一项不可能的任务。",
	"One of the climactic battles of the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity} was a clash between the stalwart {@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR|Dawnfather} and the engine of callous destruction known as the {@deity The Chained Oblivion|Exandria|TDCSR|Chained Oblivion}. This battle came to a dramatic and explosive conclusion in the {@book Alabaster Sierras|TDCSR|4|Alabaster Sierras}. The unstable arcane forces unleashed in their battle created the valley that now houses the {@book Parchwood|TDCSR|4|Parchwood Timberlands}, thrusting the surrounding mountains upward and infusing them with incredible amounts of {@item residuum|TDCSR}—the physical residue of arcane energy.": "{@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity}的高潮战役之一是坚毅的{@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR|Dawnfather}和被称为{@deity The Chained Oblivion|Exandria|TDCSR|Chained Oblivion}的冷酷无情的破坏引擎之间的冲突。这场战斗在{@book Alabaster Sierras|TDCSR|4|Alabaster Sierras}的时候达到了戏剧性和爆炸性的结论。不稳定的奥术力量在他们的战斗中释放出来，形成了现在的山谷，容纳了{@book Parchwood|TDCSR|4|Parchwood Timberlands}，将周围的山脉向上推，并注入了难以置信的{@item residuum|TDCSR}--奥术能量的物理残留物。",
	"The sheer amount of leftover arcane power within the {@item whitestone|TDCSR} of the mountains is incredibly receptive to enchantment. Magic items that incorporate at least an ounce of {@item whitestone|TDCSR} into their construction require only one-quarter the creation time of other magic items. Some alchemists in {@book Emon|TDCSR|4|Emon, the City of Fellowship} have discovered that dissolving {@item whitestone|TDCSR} with specific acids can leave behind pure {@item residuum|TDCSR}, which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.": "山脉中剩余的大量奥术力量对魔法的接受程度是惊人的。至少有一盎司{@item whitestone|TDCSR}的魔法物品在制造时只需要其他魔法物品四分之一的创造时间。一些{@book Emon|TDCSR|4|Emon, the City of Fellowship}的炼金术士发现，用特定的酸溶解{@item whitestone|TDCSR}可以留下纯净的{@item residuum|TDCSR}，当这种材料不容易得到时，可以替代昂贵的法术成分。",
	"If a spell has a component cost that consumes the component, its caster can substitute the required component for an amount of {@item residuum|TDCSR} of an equal value. One pound of pure {@item residuum|TDCSR} is worth approximately 500 gp in most markets, though it becomes extremely expensive and difficult to find outside of {@book Emon|TDCSR|4|Emon, the City of Fellowship} or the city of {@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone} itself.": "如果一个法术有消耗组件的成本，其施法者可以用同等价值的{@item residuum|TDCSR}的数量来替代所需的组件。一磅纯的（%1%）在大多数市场上大约值500金币，不过在（%2%）或（%3%）城市以外的地方，它变得非常昂贵，而且很难找到。",
	"{@item Residuum|TDCSR} can also be heated and blown into glass, forming a shimmering, greenish surface. Residuum slates or orbs can be used in stationary enchanting tables. Archmages willing to pay exorbitant rates—easily 20,000 gp or more—may acquire an {@item Residuum enchanting slate|TDCSR|enchanting slate} that can be used to expedite the creation of all magic items. Using such a table allows anyone crafting a magic item to do so in one-quarter of the usual time.": "{@item Residuum|TDCSR}也可以被加热并吹成玻璃，形成一个闪闪发光的绿色表面。残留的石板或球体可以用在固定的施法台上。愿意支付高昂费用的大法师--很可能是20,000金币或更多--可以获得一个(1%)，可以用来加速所有魔法物品的制作。使用这样的桌子可以让任何制作魔法物品的人在通常时间的四分之一内完成。",
	"For many years, the de Rolo family ruled {@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone} with dignity and justice. Their noble rule was broken by Delilah Briarwood, an exiled necromancer of the Cerberus Assembly from {@book Wildemount|TDCSR|4|Wildemount}, and her {@creature vampire} husband, Sylas. Together, they slaughtered the family, took over {@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}, and plunged the city into despair.": "多年来，德-罗洛家族以尊严和正义统治着（%0%）。他们高贵的统治被来自{@book Wildemount|TDCSR|4|Wildemount}的地狱议会的流亡亡灵法师黛利拉-布里伍德和她{@creature vampire}的丈夫西拉斯打破。他们一起屠杀了这个家族，接管了{@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}，并使这个城市陷入绝望。",
	"Nearly six years later, Vox Machina returned with {@creature Percival de Rolo|TDCSR|Percival}, the only known de Rolo heir, and discovered that his sister Cassandra also still lived. The heroes defeated the {@book Briarwoods|TDCSR|4|Scars of the Briarwoods} and expunged their evil from {@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}, and the de Rolo siblings founded a new system of governance: the {@book Chamber of Whitestone|TDCSR|3|Chamber of Whitestone}.": "近六年后，Vox Machina带着唯一已知的de Rolo继承人{@creature Percival de Rolo|TDCSR|Percival}回来了，并发现他的妹妹Cassandra也仍然活着。英雄们打败了{@book Briarwoods|TDCSR|4|Scars of the Briarwoods}，并将他们的邪恶从{@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}中驱逐出去，德-罗洛兄妹建立了一个新的治理体系：{@book Chamber of Whitestone|TDCSR|3|Chamber of Whitestone}。",
	"This council consists of members appointed by the Guardian of Woven Stone, who is to remain a member of the de Rolo bloodline as long as it exists, or until the rest of the Chamber unanimously agrees there are no suitable de Rolos to accept the position.": "这个委员会由织石守护者任命的成员组成，只要德-罗洛血统存在，他就会一直是德-罗洛血统的成员，或者直到商会其他成员一致同意没有合适的德-罗洛人接受这个职位。",
	"{@book Whitestone's|TDCSR|4|Whitestone} first line of defense is made up of the obelisk wards. Hastily constructed during the time of the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|2|The Chroma Conclave} to avoid detection by their roving {@creature wyvern} armies, five {@item whitestone|TDCSR} obelisks mark the perimeter of the city and castle grounds. These obelisks form a dome of illusory magic when powered by an arcane spellcaster, hiding the city under the guise of continued, undeveloped {@book Parchwood|TDCSR|4|Parchwood Timberlands}, and shielding everything within from arcane detection. The obelisks haven't been used since the attack of the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|2|The Chroma Conclave} and are beginning to be covered by graffiti and overgrowth.": "{@book Whitestone's|TDCSR|4|Whitestone}第一道防线是由方尖碑护卫组成的。在{@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|2|The Chroma Conclave}时代，为了避免被他们游荡的{@creature wyvern}军队发现而匆忙建造的五座{@item whitestone|TDCSR}方尖碑标志着城市和城堡的周边。这些方尖碑在奥术施法者的驱动下形成了一个虚幻的魔法穹顶，将城市隐藏在持续的、未开发的（%4%）的幌子下，并屏蔽了奥术探测的一切。方尖碑自从被攻击后就没有被使用过，开始被涂鸦和杂草覆盖。",
	"For each spell slot that is syphoned into an obelisk, two hours of illusion is powered per spell level sacrificed, and the cover of the illusion barrier is incomplete unless all five obelisks are powered simultaneously. This siphoning is a taxing experience, and for every 30 spell levels sacrificed within a 24-hour period, the caster gains 1 level of exhaustion.": "每有一个法术槽被虹吸到方尖碑中，每牺牲一个法术等级就会有两个小时的幻觉，除非所有五个方尖碑同时被驱动，否则幻觉屏障的覆盖是不完整的。这种虹吸作用是一种累人的体验，在24小时内每牺牲30个法术等级，施法者就会获得1级的疲惫感。",
	"In addition to this rarely used magical ward, three groups of defensive personnel protect {@book Whitestone|TDCSR|4|Whitestone} from both within and without.": "除了这个很少使用的魔法阵之外，还有三组防御人员从内部和外部进行保护（%0%）。"
