	"Experienced D&D Adventurers League players are excited about the debut of Season 8, which will revolve around stories and adventures set in the City of Splendor to coincide with the release of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist in game stores on September 7th. Season 8 is also exciting because the admins can incorporate many of the mechanics presented in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge}. The document below and the resources available at the bottom of this page will give experienced D&D Adventurers League players an overview of the changes to come!": "经验丰富的D&D冒险者联盟玩家对第八季的首次亮相感到兴奋，该季将围绕着以辉煌之城为背景的故事和冒险，以配合《水底世界》的发行。9月7日在游戏商店发布的《水底世界：龙之劫》。第八季也是令人振奋的，因为管理员可以纳入{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge}中提出的许多机制。下面的文件和本页底部的资源可以让有经验的D&D冒险者联盟玩家对即将到来的变化有一个大致的了解!",
	"{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge} (XGE) presents our campaign with a number of exciting possibilities, including the chance reconceptualize and simplify how we handle rewards. With the start of season 8, the D&D Adventurers League (DDAL) will be undergoing a sweeping overhaul of many of our rulesets and here we focus on how we can make our system of rewards fit more styles of play and give players more choices. Let's take a look at the new changes regarding rewards.": "{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge}(XGE)为我们的活动带来了许多令人兴奋的可能性，包括重新构思和简化我们处理奖励的方式。随着第八赛季的开始，D&D冒险者联盟（DDAL）将对我们的许多规则集进行全面的改革，在此我们重点讨论如何使我们的奖励系统适合更多的游戏风格，给玩家更多的选择。让我们来看看关于奖励的新变化。",
	"Starting with Season 8, the DDAL will be using the Experience Check Point system described in XGE with some slight adjustments (see below). This system rewards every character (and player) for taking part in a play session. For published hardcover adventures, a character receives 1 advancement checkpoint for each hour played that DM deems the characters are making progress toward their goals. For all other types of Adventurers League adventures, a character receives a maximum of 1 advancement checkpoint for each hour of the adventure's projected playing time, rather than the actual time spent at the table, with those checkpoints being awarded for achieving specific goals listed in the adventure.": "从第八赛季开始，DDAL将使用XGE中描述的经验检查点系统，并进行一些轻微的调整（见下文）。这个系统奖励每个参加游戏环节的角色（和玩家）。对于已出版的精装冒险，每玩一个小时，DM认为角色朝着他们的目标取得了进展，角色就会得到一个进阶检查点。对于所有其他类型的冒险者联盟冒险，一个角色在冒险的预计游戏时间内每小时最多获得1个进阶检查点，而不是在桌子上花费的实际时间，这些检查点是为实现冒险中列出的特定目标而授予。",
	"Some adventures may award or subtract an advancement checkpoint based on the level of success. For example, your party might complete an epic quest and save all the land, receiving a bonus advancement checkpoint, or they might choose to let all the innocents burn in favor of sleeping in, losing one advancement checkpoint from their total for playing that adventure.": "有些冒险可能会根据成功的程度奖励或减去一个进阶检查点。例如，你的队伍可能完成了一个史诗般的任务，拯救了所有的土地，获得了一个额外的进阶检查点，或者他们可能选择让所有的无辜者被烧死，而选择睡在里面，从他们玩这个冒险的总数中失去一个进阶检查点。",
	"The DDAL does not allow characters to play outside of their tier. References to rewards for playing above or below a character's tier should be ignored.": "DDAL不允许角色在其等级之外进行游戏。应该忽略关于高于或低于某个角色等级的奖励的说法。",
	"Each time you play an adventure, you may choose to gain advancement checkpoints toward your next level at the normal pace, or slow your progress granting more opportunities to play your character at the current level. If you choose to slow your progression, your character receives half the number of advancement checkpoints that would be awarded and you also receive half the number of treasure checkpoints and downtime days awarded by each adventure. Do not round, but rather track half points. Using the slow progression option does not halve the gold received for gaining a new level.": "每次你进行冒险时，你可以选择以正常的速度获得晋级检查点，或者放慢你的进度，给予更多的机会让你的角色在当前的水平上发挥。如果你选择放慢你的进度，你的角色将获得一半的进阶检查点，你也将获得一半的宝藏检查点和每个冒险所授予的停工日。不要四舍五入，而是追踪一半的点数。使用缓慢进阶选项并不会使获得新等级的金币减半。",
	"To determine the number of Advancement Checkpoints your characters currently has, follow these simple steps.": "要确定你的角色目前拥有的进阶检查点的数量，请遵循以下简单步骤。",
	"Find the experience your character has in excess of that which is required for their current level by subtracting the experience needed to achieve your current level from your current total.": "从你目前的总数中减去达到你目前等级所需的经验，找出你的角色所拥有的超过当前等级所需的经验。",
	"Find the experience you need to achieve your next level by subtracting the experience needed to achieve your current level from the experience needed to achieve your next level.": "用达到当前级别所需的经验减去达到下一级别所需的经验，就能找到达到下一级别所需的经验。",
	"Determine how far into your level you are by dividing the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.": "用步骤1的结果除以步骤2的结果，确定你的水平有多高。",
	"To determine the number of advancement checkpoints you now have, multiply the result of step 3 by the number of experience checkpoints needed to achieve your next level.": "要确定你现在拥有的进阶检查点的数量，请将步骤3的结果乘以达到下一等级所需的经验检查点的数量。",
	"If the result of step for is not an integer, round the result down or up. (Your choice.)": "如果步骤f的结果不是整数，将结果向下或向上取整（你选择）。",
	"If you wish to use the Slow Progression, divide your result by 2.": "如果你想使用慢速前进法，请将你的结果除以2。",
	"Your character has 3,000 xp more than the 14,000 xp needed to achieve level 6. (17,000 xp–14,000 xp)": "你的角色比达到6级所需的14,000 xp多出3,000 xp。(17,000 xp-14,000 xp)",
	"Level 7 requires 23,000 xp; 9,000 xp over the amount needed for level 6. (23,000 xp–14,000 xp)": "7级需要23,000xp；比6级所需的数量多出9,000xp。(23,000 xp-14,000 xp)",
	"Your character is 33% of the way to level 7. (3,000 xp / 9,000 xp = 0.33)": "你的角色有33%的时间达到7级。(3,000 xp / 9,000 xp = 0.33)",
	"In the new system, it takes 8 check points to gain 7th-level. You currently have 2.64 check points (0.33 * 8).": "在新的系统中，需要8个检查点才能获得第七级。你目前有2.64个检查点（0.33*8）。",
	"You choose to round up. Your character has 3 checkpoints of the 8 that they need to make it to level 7.": "你选择四舍五入。你的角色有3个检查点，而他们需要8个检查点才能升到7级。",
	"DDAL adventures reward and use treasure checkpoints as describe in XGE, though the costs have been changed (see the FAQ, below). These points are spent on the item list. Some DDAL adventures may also include unique or particularly thematic items that are unlocked when you find them. These items and their associated cost are added to this list of items available for your character to purchase. Items unlocked for a season that are not found through play are only purchasable during that season.": "DDAL冒险的奖励和使用的宝藏检查点与XGE中描述的一样，不过费用有所改变（见下文的FAQ）。这些点数是在物品清单上花费的。一些DDAL冒险可能还包括独特的或特别有主题的物品，当你找到它们时就会被解锁。这些物品和它们的相关费用会被添加到这个物品列表中，供你的角色购买。在某个季节解锁的物品，如果不是通过游戏找到的，只能在该季节购买。",
	"Your character keeps all of the gold and items they currently have except as listed below under Problematic Items (below). Rules for trading items are not changed.": "你的角色保留他们目前拥有的所有金币和物品，除了下面列出的有问题的物品（以下）。交易物品的规则没有改变。",
	"Treasure previously available for purchase from your faction, if you had one, is no longer available. Any items you have purchased by this method are retained.": "以前可以从你的派别购买的宝物，如果你有的话，就不再有了。你通过这种方法购买的任何物品都会保留。",
	"Some items currently in the campaign have proven disproportionately disruptive and are immediately removed from play (see the FAQ, below). If your character has one of these items, they receive the listed compensation. If there is a choice of items or treasure checkpoints, you must choose one of the options. If you gain treasure points, you must spend immediately on items of your character's tier or lower using the Treasure Points lists above. If you're still playing the adventure from which the items were awarded, immediately convert it to a Story Item (see the FAQ, below) instead of gaining treasure checkpoints and begin earning treasure checkpoints as described above.": "目前活动中的一些物品已经被证明具有不相称的破坏性，并立即从游戏中移除（见下文的常见问题）。如果你的角色有这些物品之一，他们会得到列出的补偿。如果有物品或宝藏检查点的选择，你必须选择其中的一个选项。如果你获得了宝藏点，你必须立即使用上面的宝藏点清单，花在你的角色的等级或更低的物品上。如果你还在玩获得物品的冒险，请立即将其转换为故事物品（见下面的常见问题），而不是获得宝藏检查点，并开始赚取上述的宝藏检查点。",
	"Some items on this list, such as the Icon of Ravenloft or Tinderstrike, are found in hardcover adventures where the item is needed to complete the goal of the adventure. These magic items become a special kind of Story Award that is bound to the party. Once the characters find one of these items, the party is considered to have it whenever they are playing that adventure—so long as one of the characters that found it is present. If a character leaves the party to participate in a different adventure, the item stays behind for other members of the party to use and does not go with the traveling character but is available to be used by them should they return. When the adventure is completed, the story award expires, and the item is removed from play.": "这张清单上的一些物品，比如雷文洛夫特的图标或Tinderstrike，是在精装冒险中发现的，在那里需要该物品来完成冒险的目标。这些魔法物品成为一种特殊的故事奖，与当事人绑定。一旦角色们找到了这些物品，只要他们在玩那个冒险，就会被认为拥有它--只要找到它的角色之一在场。如果一个角色离开队伍去参加另一个冒险，这个物品就会留下来供队伍中的其他成员使用，而不会随旅行的角色一起离开，但如果他们回来，就可以被他们使用。当冒险完成后，故事奖励就会失效，物品也会从游戏中移除。",
