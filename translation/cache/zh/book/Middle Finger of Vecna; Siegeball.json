	"It's time we talk about Siegeball. People in every campaign world need some form of recreational past time, apart from killing monsters and going on quests, of course. Siegeball, a concept I stole /tg/ (read about it here), was my go-to for campaigns set in 3.5. It's fun, violent, complements all kinds of characters, and makes clever use of existing game mechanics. However, the sport sorely needed an update for 5th edition, so I've taken it upon myself to simplify the sport a little and convert it over.": "现在是我们谈论围攻球的时候了。每个战役世界的人都需要某种形式的娱乐消遣，当然除了杀怪和做任务之外。攻城球，一个我从/tg/偷来的概念（在这里阅读），是我在3.5版本的战役中的首选。它很有趣，很暴力，与各种角色相得益彰，并巧妙地利用了现有的游戏机制。然而，这项运动非常需要在第五版中进行更新，所以我决定将这项运动简化一下，并将其转换过来。",
	"Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can't attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball which can be used to knock down the towers. A team loses when their tower falls.": "攻城球是在两队之间进行的游戏，每队有五名玩家。每队都有一座塔，以防御对方的攻击。然而，玩家不能直接攻击塔楼。相反，有一个球可以用来击倒塔楼。当一队的塔倒下时，他们就输了。",
	"The game is played in a walled rectangular arena. Normally, this arena is 140 feet long by 45 feet wide (28 squares by 9 squares), though arenas of all sizes and shapes exist. Each team's tower, a 5-foot dimeter pillar made of wood or loose stone, is set up 10 feet from each end of the arena lengthwise. Towers have 25 hit points and can only be damaged by the impact of the ball.": "比赛是在一个有墙的长方形竞技场进行的。通常情况下，这个竞技场长140英尺，宽45英尺（28个方块乘9个方块），尽管存在各种大小和形状的竞技场。每队的塔，是一个由木头或松散的石头制成的5英尺直径的柱子，从竞技场的两端纵向设置10英尺。塔有25个打击点，只能被球的冲击力损坏。",
	"Central to the game of siegeball is the ball, an especially dense sphere of solid rubber or wrapped leather that is pursued by the players. The ball is astoundingly heavy, and players move it by attacking it. Though in some places, players strike the ball with their hands or fists, usually players are given bats (which use the statistics of a club), or even more powerful melee weapons, like warhammers and mauls.": "攻城球游戏的核心是球，这是一个特别密集的实心橡胶或包裹皮革的球体，由球员追赶。这个球重得惊人，球员通过攻击它来移动它。虽然在一些地方，球员用手或拳头击球，但通常球员都会得到球棒（使用俱乐部的统计数据），或更强大的近战武器，如战锤和槌子。",
	"The ball has an AC of 8 and a pool of Momentum Points, which determine how fast it's moving.": "该球的AC值为8，并有一个动量点，这决定了它的移动速度。",
	"{@b Attacking the Ball}. When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. On a hit, the ball gains a number of momentum points equal to half the damage dealt to it, rounded down. The ball moves five feet in the chosen direction for each momentum point it has. As it moves, the ball subtracts one momentum point for each five feet it moves until it stops.": "{@b Attacking the Ball}. 当你攻击球时，你可以选择在八个基本方向中的一个方向攻击它。击中后，球获得的动量点数等于它所受伤害的一半，向下取整。球在所选择的方向上移动五英尺，每一个动量点。在移动过程中，球每移动五英尺就会减去一个动量点，直到它停止。",
	"The ball can collide with wall, objects, or towers.": "球可以与墙壁、物体或塔楼相撞。",
	"{@b Colliding with a Wall}. If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops. Colliding with a Player. You can use your reaction to hit the ball if it collides with you. To do so, make an attack roll targeting the ball. While moving, the ball has a bonus to its AC equal to its current momentum points. On a hit, roll damage as normal, remove the ball's current momentum points, and send it in a new direction. If you miss, the ball hits you, and you take damage equal to twice the ball's current momentum points and are knocked prone.": "{@b Colliding with a Wall}. 如果球与墙相撞，它会以与其方向相对应的角度弹开，并继续移动，直到停止。与球员相撞。如果球与你相撞，你可以用你的反应来打球。要做到这一点，请做一个针对球的攻击卷。在移动时，球有一个等于其当前动量点的AC值的加成。一旦命中，就会像平常一样掷出伤害值，移除球的当前动量点，并将其送至一个新的方向。如果你没有击中，球会击中你，你会受到相当于球当前动量点两倍的伤害并被击倒。",
	"If you do not use your reaction to stop the ball, it rolls past you.": "如果你不利用你的反应来阻止球，它就会从你身边滚过。",
	"{@b Colliding with a Tower}. If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the twice the ball's current momentum points and then stops.": "{@b Colliding with a Tower}. 如果球与塔相撞，它对塔造成的伤害等于球当前动量点的两倍，然后停止。",
	"Playing the Game The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball. The player with the higher attack roll successfully attacks the ball. Players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball, but need not begin on their own side.": "比赛开始时，在场馆中心开球。每队的一名球员对球进行攻击卷。攻击卷数较高的球员成功攻击球。球员从距离球10英尺和30英尺范围内开始，但不需要从自己这边开始。",
	"Players act in initiative order. If preferable, the DM can choose for the teams to take turns acting, instead of keeping track of the players individually. The game ends when a tower is reduced to 0 hp.": "玩家按主动权顺序行动。如果愿意的话，管理员可以选择让各队轮流行动，而不是单独跟踪玩家。当一个塔被减少到0马力时，游戏结束。",
	"Siegeball is a widely-played sport and the exact rules and standards change wherever the game is played. The only concrete rule of Siegeball is not to attack your opponent's tower directly. In most arenas, using magic and attacking players directly are also considered cheating (though this doesn't stop some witches and wizards from influencing the games anyway). However, other behaviors, like shoving opposing players or kicking dirt into their eyes, is tolerated and sometimes even encouraged.": "攻城球是一项广泛开展的运动，无论在哪里进行比赛，确切的规则和标准都会改变。围攻球的唯一具体规则是不要直接攻击对手的塔。在大多数竞技场，使用魔法和直接攻击玩家也被认为是作弊（尽管这并不能阻止一些巫师和魔法师影响游戏）。然而，其他行为，如推搡对方球员或将泥土踢入他们的眼睛，是可以容忍的，有时甚至是鼓励的。",
	"In seedier games, Siegeball is a violent, high-stakes competition. with spellcasters on both sides attempting to secretly fix the game for their side, while the players try to disguise outright attacks on their opponents as legitimate maneuvers. Bets on Siegeball range from a few silver pieces to bags of gold, and games are particularly cut-throat when fortunes are on the line.": "在更多的游戏中，攻城球是一种暴力、高风险的竞争。双方的施法者都试图为自己一方暗中修复游戏，而玩家则试图将对对手的直接攻击伪装成合法的机动性。赌注从几块银币到几袋金子不等，当财富处于危险境地时，游戏就会变得特别残酷。",
	"In addition to attacking, dodging, shoving, and dashing, (and occasionally using an item forbidden by the referees), there are a few special actions that players of a siegeball game might take.": "除了攻击、躲避、推搡和冲撞，（偶尔也会使用裁判员禁止的物品），攻城球游戏的玩家还可能采取一些特殊行动。",
	"{@b Attack a Player (Illegally)}. In the most disreputable games, direct assaults on other players is not only allowed, it's encouraged. In most games, however, an attack can only be made when the referee isn't looking. When you make an attack on a creature in an arena that doesn't allow direct attacks, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee's passive Perception score. On a success, you attack the player without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game for the following round, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower.": "{@b Attack a Player (Illegally)}. 在最令人不齿的游戏中，直接攻击其他玩家不仅是允许的，而且是鼓励的。然而，在大多数游戏中，只有在裁判员不注意的时候才能进行攻击。当你在一个不允许直接攻击的竞技场中对一个生物进行攻击时，请进行灵巧（隐身）检查或魅力（欺骗）检查，由裁判员的被动感知得分来争夺。如果成功，你就会攻击该玩家而不产生后果。如果失败，你将在下一回合退出游戏，并在竞技场靠近你的塔的一侧重新进入游戏。",
	"Shove actions do not incur a penalty.": "推搡行为不会产生惩罚。",
	"{@b Block}. You dig in your heels and hold your ground. You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to resist being moved against your will, and you can use your reaction to attack any ball that moves within 5 feet of you. Additionally, if the ball is within 5 feet of you, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against it.": "{@b Block}. 你紧紧抓住你的脚跟，坚守阵地。你在任何能力检查或蓄力投掷中都有优势，以抵制违背你意愿的移动，并且你可以使用你的反应来攻击任何在你5英尺范围内移动的球。此外，如果球在你的5英尺范围内，其他生物在对它进行攻击时有劣势。",
	"{@b Cast a Spell (Illegally)}. In very high society (especially elven society) certain types of more civilized magic might be allowed in siegeball games, but the vast majority of games, any arcana is paramount to cheating. When you cast a spell in an arena that doesn't allow magic, you can make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee's passive Perception score. This roll has advantage if the target is within 5 feet of you, the effect of the spell doesn't include any large audio or visual cues (like certain illusion spells, or spells like gust of wind), or the spell is cast with the sorcerer's Subtle Spell Metamagic. It has disadvantage if the target of the spell is more than 5 feet away from you, or if the effect of the spell has obvious audio or visual effects. On a success, you cast the spell without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game for the following round, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower.": "{@b Cast a Spell (Illegally)}. 在非常高的社会中（尤其是精灵社会），某些类型的更文明的魔法可能在攻城球游戏中被允许，但绝大多数的游戏，任何奥术都是最重要的作弊手段。当你在一个不允许使用魔法的竞技场中施法时，你可以做一个灵巧（隐身）检查或魅力（欺骗）检查，由裁判员的被动感知得分来竞争。如果目标在你的5英尺范围内，法术的效果不包括任何大型的声音或视觉提示（比如某些幻觉法术，或者像阵风这样的法术），或者该法术是用巫师的微妙法术Metamagic施放的，那么该卷就有优势。如果法术的目标离你超过5英尺，或者法术的效果有明显的音频或视觉效果，那么它就有劣势。成功时，你施展该法术而不产生任何后果。失败时，你将在下一回合退出游戏，并在竞技场靠近你的塔的一侧重新进入游戏。",
	"Inborn magical abilities like a dragonborn's Breath Weapon may or may not count as magic, at the referee's discretion.": "天生的魔法能力，如龙裔的呼吸武器，可以算作魔法，也可以不算，由裁判员决定。",
	"{@b Follow}. When you take this action, choose a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. When that creature moves, you attempt to follow behind it, moving up to your base speed, while remaining the same distance between yourself and the lead creature for the entire duration of the movement.": "{@b Follow}. 当你采取这个行动时，选择一个你能看到的在你10英尺范围内的生物。当那个生物移动时，你试图跟在它后面，以你的基本速度移动，同时在整个移动过程中，你和领先的生物之间保持相同的距离。",
	"{@b Retire}. When you take this action, you remove yourself from the field and sit out the rest of the game. This may be useful to free yourself from danger, but you can no longer help your team.": "{@b Retire}. 当你采取这一行动时，你会把自己从场上移开，并在游戏的剩余时间内坐视不理。这对使自己摆脱危险可能是有用的，但你不能再帮助你的球队。",
	"{@b Tackle}. Performing a tackle is a special variant of shoving a creature. You have advantage on a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). On a success, you and the target are knocked prone in the target's space.": "{@b Tackle}. 进行擒拿是推搡生物的一个特殊变体。你在由目标的力量（竞技）或灵巧（杂技）检定（由目标选择使用的能力）所争夺的力量（竞技）检定中具有优势。如果成功，你和目标都会被击倒在目标的空间里。",
	"Different siegeball arenas impose different restrictions on the games they hold, ranging from so-called underground arenas, where blood is more important than sport, to the mainstream arenas, which are funded by kings or other nobility, and thus impose fairly civilized rules.": "不同的攻城球赛场对他们举行的比赛有不同的限制，从所谓的地下赛场，血液比运动更重要，到主流赛场，由国王或其他贵族资助，因此实行相当文明的规则。",
	"The following are some of restrictions that an arena might impose on the game:": "以下是竞技场可能对游戏施加的一些限制。",
	"{@b Everything Goes}. Magic, deadly weapons, direct attacks on players, and even murder is all allowed in this game. Arenas that play with these rules are typically deemed Blood Arenas by spectators, and their players (which are paid handsomely for surviving) are more like gladiators than professional athletes. Expect these arenas in drow cities, and other evil locales.": "{@b Everything Goes}. 在这个游戏中，魔法、致命武器、直接攻击玩家，甚至谋杀都是允许的。遵循这些规则的竞技场通常被观众认为是血腥竞技场，他们的选手（为生存而获得丰厚的报酬）更像是角斗士而不是职业运动员。预计这些竞技场将出现在鸦人城市和其他邪恶的地方。",
	"{@b Everything Goes (Limited)}. Magic and direct attacks on other players are allowed, but only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed, and outright murder disqualifies a team. These rules are typically held in run-down arenas in less prosperous cities (where new siegeball teams might just get their start.)": "{@b Everything Goes (Limited)}. 允许使用魔法和直接攻击其他玩家，但只允许使用常规的攻城球武器，而直接谋杀会取消球队的资格。这些规则通常在不太繁荣的城市的破旧竞技场举行（新的攻城球队可能只是在那里起步。）",
	"{@b All Weapons}. Weapons of any variety can be used in this game, up to and including massive warhammers and greatswords, but no magic of any sort is allowed. Towers have twice the HP in this game. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.": "{@b All Weapons}. 本游戏中可以使用任何种类的武器，包括大型战锤和大剑，但不允许使用任何种类的魔法。在这个游戏中，塔楼的HP是两倍。对其他玩家的攻击和非法的魔法都会受到惩罚，将违规的玩家赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个队伍被取消资格。",
	"This variant of the rules is similar to the conventional rules, but allows for spectacular and dangerous weapons (and, of course, more deadly \"accidents\"). Particularly ravenous crowds flock to these games for the fleeting chance of watching blood being spilled.": "这种规则的变体与传统规则相似，但允许使用壮观和危险的武器（当然还有更致命的 \"事故\"）。特别是贪婪的人群涌向这些游戏，因为有转瞬即逝的机会可以看到血流成河。",
	"{@b Limited Magic}. Some spells, specifically those which do not directly deal damage to members of the other team, are allowed and allowed. At least one player on each team is encouraged to know the spells dispel magic and counterspell. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team. Teleporting another player mid-game across the continent, however, is allowed.": "{@b Limited Magic}. 一些法术，特别是那些不直接对另一队成员造成伤害的法术，是允许的，也是被允许的。我们鼓励每队至少有一名队员知道驱散魔法和反魔法的法术。对其他队员的攻击和非法的魔法会受到惩罚，将违规的队员赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整队的资格被取消。然而，在比赛中把另一名球员传送到大陆另一边是允许的。",
	"These rules are more common where magic is viewed more favorably as a civilized art, rather than as the trickery of elves and witches. Though the spectators might seem more refined at first glance, they are just as ravenous for the blood and conflict of a good siegeball game.": "这些规则在魔法被视为文明艺术而非精灵和巫师的诡计时更为常见。虽然观众乍看之下可能更高雅，但他们也同样渴望一场精彩的攻城球比赛的血腥和冲突。",
	"{@b Conventional}. Only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed in this game, and all magic is disallowed. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.": "{@b Conventional}. 本游戏中只允许使用传统的攻城球武器，所有的魔法都是不允许的。对其他球员的攻击和非法的魔法将受到惩罚，即把违规的球员赶出场外。如果其队员因违反规则而被驱逐出场三次，或其队员直接杀死对方队员，则整个队伍被取消资格。",
	"This is the dominant system of rules for the game, practiced in the most prominent siegeball arenas.": "这是游戏规则的主导系统，在最著名的围攻赛场上实行。",
	"Though individual, one-off siegeball games are held regularly, there's nothing so spectacular as a tournament: the thrill of rising to the top, the sting of defeat, and the lure of a grand prize and lasting glory. Few other things bring out spectators and players alike in droves. The grandeur of such tournaments is integral to siegeball on a grand scale, as they bring far-flung teams together, expand the sport's scope to a national scale, and unite players and spectators in a single, [grand] competition.": "虽然个人的、一次性的攻城球比赛经常举行，但没有什么比锦标赛更壮观的了：登顶的快感，失败的刺痛，以及大奖和持久荣誉的诱惑。很少有其他事情能让观众和球员成群结队地参加。这类锦标赛的宏大规模是围攻棒球不可或缺的，因为它们将遥远的队伍聚集在一起，将这项运动的范围扩大到全国范围，并将球员和观众团结在一个单一的[盛大]比赛中。",
	"Though tournaments are the lifeblood of career siegeball teams, there exists no one perfect way of conducting them. Each method of arranging a tournament has radical pros and cons, though most attempt to strike a balance between audience tension and accurate assessment of skill. The following tournament designs are often used for siegeball:": "虽然锦标赛是职业围攻队的生命线，但没有一种完美的方式来进行锦标赛。每种安排比赛的方法都有激进的优点和缺点，尽管大多数人都试图在观众的紧张感和对技能的准确评估之间取得平衡。以下是经常用于围棋的锦标赛设计。",
	" By far the simplest and shortest tournament is the singleelimination bracket. In this tournament, teams are randomly paired off on a pyramid, and losers are eliminated from the tournament. Winners advance to the next round until only one team remains.": " 到目前为止，最简单和最短的比赛是单淘汰赛。在这种比赛中，各队在金字塔上随机配对，失败者被淘汰出局。胜者进入下一轮，直到只剩下一支队伍。",
	"Though this tournament's design is attractive due to its simplicity, it suffers from some limitations. When spectators follow only a single team, they are unlikely to return after their team is eliminated; a result that is extremely likely when half of the competing teams are eliminated every round. Also, skilled teams can be eliminated early after only a single bad match, leading to upsets where the players blame the loss of an entire tournament on a single bad play or referee call.": "尽管这项比赛的设计因其简单而具有吸引力，但它也有一些局限性。当观众只关注一支球队时，他们不太可能在自己的球队被淘汰后再回来；当每轮都有一半的竞争球队被淘汰时，这种结果是极其可能的。另外，有技术的球队可能只在一场糟糕的比赛后就被提前淘汰，从而导致颠覆，即球员将整个比赛的损失归咎于一次糟糕的比赛或裁判的判罚。",
	"Despite its drawbacks, single elimination tournaments remain the favorite among orcish and goblinoid teams, perhaps because it doesn't hinder a tournament's progression if a half of a losing team is killed over the course of a game.": "尽管有缺点，单淘汰赛仍然是兽人和地精队伍的最爱，也许是因为在比赛过程中，如果输掉的队伍中有一半人被杀，也不会妨碍比赛的进程。",
	"A popular alternative to the single elimination tournament is the double elimination. This bracket proceeds like the single elimination bracket, except that losers are added to a loser's bracket, where they compete against each other. The final team remaining in the loser's bracket goes on to play the victor of the winner's bracket in the finals. This design ensures that teams play at least two games each, and that a single poor game doesn't condemn an otherwise superlative team.": "单淘汰赛的一个流行替代方案是双淘汰赛。这种比赛的过程与单淘汰赛相似，只是输家被加入到败者组，在那里他们互相竞争。最后留在败者组的球队在决赛中与胜者组的胜利者比赛。这种设计确保了各队至少各打两场比赛，而且一场糟糕的比赛也不会使一个原本优秀的球队受到谴责。",
	"A natural extension to the double elimination design, multilevel tournaments begin with all contending teams at the same \"level\", with a tournament score equal to the number of contending teams. A team gains one point on a victory, and loses one point on a defeat, and plays only other teams with the same tournament score as themselves, continuing until no two teams are on the same level (or until only one team is the victor, depending on the specific rules.) This design ensures that competitors play a roughly equal number of games, and that a maximum number of competitions happen at one time. Additionally, it's likely that teams will be more evenly matched for skill after a few rounds.": "作为双败淘汰赛设计的自然延伸，多级比赛开始时，所有参赛队都处于同一 \"级别\"，比赛得分与参赛队的数量相等。一支球队在胜利时获得一分，在失败时失去一分，并且只和其他与自己有相同比赛分数的球队比赛，一直到没有两支球队处于同一水平（或只有一支球队是胜利者，取决于具体规则）。此外，在几轮比赛之后，各队的技术可能会更加均衡。",
	"In a round-robin game, each competing team plays each other in sequence; the team with the greatest number of victories wins, or goes to a tie-breaker game. This is easily the fairest way of determining a victor, since every possible matchup in a tournament is played out, but it has yet to catch on in the national siegeball stage. Part of the reason might be that players are accustomed to the thrill of elimination, and the natural progression of more skilled teams matching against one another as the brackets become smaller. Whatever the reason, few leagues (except for elven leagues) employ this type of tournament.": "在循环赛中，各参赛队依次进行比赛；胜利次数多的队伍获胜，或进入决胜局。这是确定胜利者的最公平的方法，因为锦标赛中每一个可能的对决都会进行，但它还没有在国家围棋舞台上流行起来。部分原因可能是球员们已经习惯了淘汰赛的刺激，以及随着赛程的缩小，技术更高的球队自然会相互竞争。不管是什么原因，很少有联赛（除了精灵族联赛）采用这种类型的比赛。",
	"The annual Siegeball Championship League, held for the better part of a millennium, enjoys the largest scale and most prestigious prizes of any siegeball tournament. Taking part over a season, its athletes travel from city to city, competing in matches to separate the wheat from the chaff.": "一年一度的围棋冠军联赛，已经举办了一千年之久，是所有围棋比赛中规模最大、奖金最高的比赛。在一个赛季中，运动员们从一个城市到另一个城市，在比赛中分出高下。",
	"At its conclusion, only one team may win the Siegebowl, and claim its grand prize (normally an impressive quantity of gold). Perhaps more importantly, Championship victors claim legendary sports status for all time, and are enshrined in the Hall of Victors, an immortal dedication to champions throughout the ages.": "在比赛结束时，只有一支球队可以赢得围棋比赛，并获得其大奖（通常是数量惊人的黄金）。也许更重要的是，锦标赛的胜利者将获得永远的传奇体育地位，并被载入胜利者大厅，这是对历代冠军的不朽献礼。",
	"The Championship is a double-elimination competition, and every competing team must play one home game and one away game. Contending teams are selected by the Championship Committee, the presiding board of regulators and referees, and also must pay a hefty entry fee to compete. Though entry fees might pose an obstacle for upstart teams, they rarely present an obstacle to national contenders, which compete yearly.": "锦标赛是一项双淘汰赛，每个参赛队都必须进行一场主场比赛和一场客场比赛。参赛队伍由锦标赛委员会、监管机构和裁判的主持委员会挑选，并且必须支付高额的参赛费才能参赛。尽管报名费可能会对新晋球队构成障碍，但对于每年都参加比赛的全国性竞争者来说，它们很少构成障碍。",
	"Few games are played exclusively for bragging rights and notoriety; tournaments run on their prizes. Large, enticing awards for winning teams fuels an entire industry of talent scouts, coaches, and arena owners, from the smallest games to the largest championships. Every player dreams of glory, but earning huge prize is a close second.": "很少有游戏是完全为了炫耀权利和臭名昭著而进行的；锦标赛是靠奖金运行的。从最小的比赛到最大的冠军赛，为获胜队伍提供的大量诱人的奖励助长了整个行业的星探、教练和场馆业主。每个球员都梦想着荣誉，但赚取巨额奖金是紧随其后的。",
	"Of course, not all prizes are silver and gold. Siegeball tournaments give out a huge variety of prizes, some of which are detailed here:": "当然，不是所有的奖品都是金银财宝。Siegeball锦标赛发放的奖品种类繁多，这里详细介绍了其中的一些奖品。",
	"Most large, official tournament tournaments give out a trophy of some variety to the winning team. The classic trophy is a gold chalice with a marble base, engraved with the tournament's name and year. Other might include medals, rings, or ribbons, depending on the tournament. The best of teams collect these trophies and display them as badges of honor, but ultimately, they're fairly token. Nearly every trophy is awarded alongside a cash prize, which coaches and team owners view as far more substantial.": "大多数大型官方锦标赛都会向获胜队发放某种形式的奖杯。经典的奖杯是一个带有大理石底座的金杯，上面刻有比赛的名称和年份。其他的可能包括奖牌、戒指或丝带，这取决于比赛的情况。最好的团队会收集这些奖杯，并将其作为荣誉徽章展示，但最终，它们是相当象征性的。几乎每个奖杯都是和现金奖一起颁发的，教练和球队老板认为现金奖更有意义。",
	"The actual value of cash prizes might vary, but they generally grow (exceptionally, in fact) with the glamor and prestige of the tournament awarding them. Typical first-place prizes are listed on the cash prizes table below. Often, a second-place prize equal to half the value of the first-place prize is awarded to the runner up team.": "现金奖的实际价值可能会有所不同，但它们通常会随着颁发现金奖的锦标赛的魅力和声望而增长（事实上是异常的）。典型的第一名的奖金列在下面的现金奖表中。通常情况下，第二名的奖金相当于第一名奖金的一半，颁发给亚军队伍。",
	"Other valuable items, equivalent in value to cash prize, might be awarded instead. Anything from magic items, to priceless treasures donated from the king's coffers, to entire keeps or tracks of land could be at stake for the winning team. It is assumed that such prizes will probably be sold (at least in part, if the prize in question can be divided) to pay the team, the coach, and the arena owner sponsoring the team. Other items, like artifacts, might be powerful enough that the fate of many innocents might rely on the winner of the tournament. Though such awards might seem extremely foolhardy, they're not uncommon among the elves, who appreciate the dramatics.": "其他有价值的物品，相当于现金奖励的价值，也可能被授予。从魔法物品，到国王国库中捐赠的无价之宝，再到整个庄园或土地，都可能成为获胜队伍的赌注。我们认为，这些奖品可能会被出售（至少部分出售，如果有关奖品可以分割），以支付球队、教练和赞助球队的竞技场所有者。其他项目，如神器，可能足够强大，许多无辜者的命运可能取决于比赛的获胜者。虽然这样的奖励可能看起来非常愚蠢，但在精灵中并不罕见，他们欣赏这种戏剧性。",
	"One of the more obvious uses for a siegeball tournament is as a wrapper for an entire campaign, as the two match exceedingly well. Campaigns involving siegeball feel very different depending on the party's level, adopting different themes, goals, and villains as the party progresses. This section will cover three different types of siegeball tournament campaigns:": "攻城球比赛的一个更明显的用途是作为整个战役的包装，因为这两者非常匹配。涉及攻城球的战役感觉非常不同，这取决于党派的级别，随着党派的发展，采用不同的主题、目标和反派人物。本节将介绍三种不同类型的攻城球比赛活动。",
	"Before 5th level, siegeball campaigns are bound to be gritty affairs of underground tournaments taking place in dangerous arenas. Until the party achieves enough notoriety to be noticed by a siegeball scout, every day is a struggle for survival. Brutal enemy teams leave them battered and bruised after every game, and lethal weapons like warhammers are brought in regularly. Each game risks life and death, in addition to lifechanging glory.": "在5级之前，攻城球运动必然是在危险的竞技场上进行的地下比赛的狡猾事务。在党派取得足够的声望以被攻城球侦察员注意之前，每天都是为生存而斗争。残酷的敌方队伍在每场比赛后都会让他们遍体鳞伤，而像战锤这样的致命武器也会定期被送来。每场比赛除了改变生命的荣耀外，还有生死的风险。",
	"The party's coach (or owner, as the case may be) will likely be an antagonist in this type of campaign, acting as a driving force to push the party toward ever more dangerous games, while paying them as little as possible, and making escape impossible. The coach is more obsessed with money than safety, and may even place bets against the party in their most perilous games.": "党的教练（或老板，视情况而定）很可能在这种类型的活动中成为对手，作为一种推动力，将党推向越来越危险的游戏，同时尽可能少地支付他们，并使他们无法逃脱。教练对金钱比对安全更着迷，甚至可能在他们最危险的游戏中对他们下注。",
	"The competitors at this level are a combination of the underprivileged athletes with big dreams and criminally violent players that could never advance higher in the game, due to their contempt for authority. A team made exclusive of this latter group might not fare well against the party in winning a game of siegeball, but could easily kill one of them mid-game.": "这个级别的竞争者是拥有伟大梦想的贫困运动员和犯罪暴力的球员的组合，由于他们对权威的蔑视，他们永远不可能在游戏中获得更高的地位。由这后一类人组成的队伍在赢得围攻球比赛时可能不会有好的结果，但在比赛中可以轻易地杀死他们中的一个。",
	"When the party finally attains a modicum of success in the underground siegeball arenas, they'll likely be spotted by a siegeball recruiter for a medium or large city and be signed on a long-term contract. Right away, they'll be gifted new uniforms and equipment, and will be placed in a tournament against vastly more professional teams. With enough skill and daring, the party might rise to the top of their first professional siegeball tournament to become the underdogs with a shot at the top.": "当当事人最终在地下围攻赛场上取得一定的成功时，他们很可能会被一个大中型城市的围攻赛招募者看中，并与之签订长期合同。马上，他们就会得到新的制服和设备，并被安排与更多的专业队伍进行比赛。如果有足够的技巧和胆量，他们可能会在第一次职业攻城球比赛中脱颖而出，成为有机会登顶的弱者。",
	"Traveling from city to city for siegeball games gives the party a chance to explore the campaign world, and opens up possibilities for roadside encounters and diversions from the main tournament. Any distraction that seriously injures a party member or delays the party from reaching the stadium in time could endanger their careers as well, so even sidequests have a measure of potential risk.": "从一个城市到另一个城市参加攻城球比赛，使党有机会探索战役世界，并为路边的遭遇和主要比赛的转移提供了可能性。任何严重伤害党员或拖延党员及时到达体育场的分心行为都可能危及他们的职业生涯，所以即使是副业也有一定的潜在风险。",
	"At this level of the campaign, the ruthlessly competitive opposing teams will rise to become the chief antagonists. This is a great place to insert an experienced rival team who are favored to win the tournament as a foil to the party's underdog standing. Other interesting teams with strong gimmicks are key to pad out the tournament before the final game.": "在这个级别的活动中，竞争无情的对手球队将上升为主要的对立面。这是一个很好的地方，可以插入一个有经验的对手球队，他们被认为可以赢得比赛，作为党的弱势地位的陪衬。其他具有强大噱头的有趣团队是在最后一场比赛前垫定比赛的关键。",
	"Of course, it's possible that the party might find interesting offers coming in from private siegeball arrangements, where 'no rules' games are played behind closed doors for a selected audience. These games are clearly unsafe, and those arranging them seem very suspect, but the lavish pay is enticing nonetheless.": "当然，党可能会发现来自私人围棋安排的有趣提议，在那里，\"没有规则 \"的游戏是闭门为选定的观众进行的。这些游戏显然是不安全的，而且安排这些游戏的人似乎非常可疑，但奢华的报酬还是很诱人。",
	"Lastly, this period of the campaign sees the party achieving their first real fame: they'll be recognized on the street and be asked to sign autographs by die-hard siegeball fans. They're not going to be mobbed by the adoring public quite yet, but this might nonetheless go to their heads.": "最后，在活动的这段时间里，该党首次获得了真正的名声：他们会在街上被认出，并被死忠的围攻者要求签名。他们还不会被崇拜的公众围攻，但这可能会影响到他们的想法。",
	"At the highest level campaigns, the party, who have been playing professional siegeball for some time, is selected by the Championship Committee for inclusion in the Siegeball Championship, the most prestigious tournament anywhere. This is a make-or-break moment in their careers -- a single shot at legendary status.": "在最高级别的运动中，已经打了一段时间的职业围攻球的当事人，被冠军委员会选中参加围攻球锦标赛，这是任何地方最著名的比赛。这是他们职业生涯中的一个决定性时刻 -- 一次获得传奇地位的机会。",
	"The first obstacle is not the tournament itself, but the steep entry fee. The party might have to sell most of their belongings or accept a dangerous loan to compete. Whatever solution they find, a lot will be riding on them winning a cash prize in the Championship.": "第一个障碍不是比赛本身，而是高昂的参赛费。该党可能不得不卖掉他们的大部分财产或接受危险的贷款来参加比赛。无论他们找到什么样的解决方案，他们能否在锦标赛中赢得现金奖励将是一大关键。",
	"When the tournament begins in earnest, the party will compete against the most experienced teams in the world, each of which desperately wants to win the tournament. Each game will be a nail-biting struggle of wills, and the party will need every trick they know to succeed.": "当比赛正式开始时，党将与世界上最有经验的球队竞争，每支球队都迫切希望赢得比赛。每场比赛都将是一场扣人心弦的意志斗争，党将需要他们知道的每一个技巧来取得成功。",
	"Additionally, the Championship tends to attract contenders from much further afield, including a host of non-humanoid teams. Teams of djinni and efreeti travel from the Elemental Planes to compete, and a team of driders always rises from to represent the underworld in the competition. Sahuagin, lizardfolk, and fey creatures like satyrs all travel from their homelands to compete. Sometimes, even a duo of giants enter the competition, wielding a siege club in each hand.": "此外，锦标赛往往会吸引来自更远的地方的竞争者，包括大量的非人形队伍。精灵和埃弗里蒂的队伍从元素界赶来参加比赛，而一支龙骑士队伍总是从地下世界赶来代表比赛。萨瓦金（Sahuagin）、蜥蜴人（Lizardfolk）和萨提尔（Satyrs）等精灵生物都从他们的家乡赶来参加比赛。有时，甚至有一对巨人参加比赛，每只手都挥舞着一根攻城棍。",
	"Between games is a long, nervous period of practice matches, punctuated by intrigue. Large conspiracies surround the Championship, from hazardous, illegal drugs being taken by other players to enhance their speed and strength, to sinister donors that have entered new teams in the tournament for mysterious reasons, to plots to sabotage the party's chances of victory. If the party wants any chance of winning, investigating and exposing these schemes is critical.": "比赛之间是一段漫长而紧张的练习赛，其间夹杂着阴谋。巨大的阴谋围绕着锦标赛，从其他球员服用危险的非法药物以提高他们的速度和力量，到阴险的捐助者出于神秘的原因在锦标赛中加入新的队伍，到破坏党的胜利机会的阴谋。如果该党想获得任何胜利的机会，调查和揭露这些阴谋是至关重要的。",
	"At this stage of the campaign, the party can be considered superstars. Ordinary people get starstruck around them (even those who don't follow siegeball), and they find it hard to push through crowds before games. While this makes covert activity difficult, it also means that common folks will probably help the party in small ways if asked.": "在这个阶段，该党可以说是超级明星。普通人在他们身边会追星（即使是那些不关注攻城球的人），他们发现在比赛前很难挤进人群。虽然这使得秘密活动变得困难，但也意味着如果被要求，普通人很可能会以小的方式帮助该党。",
	"Because siegeball is a full-contact sport, most athletes rely on sturdy, dependable gear to achieve a long career. The specifics of siegeball gear may vary, but all are designed from the same framework as conventional armor, fitting hardened leather and metal plates strategically to mitigate impact. Chiefly, however, siegeball gear places in importance on mobility, and so tends to be lighter and more flexible van contemporary armor, if not less protective.": "由于围棋是一项全接触的运动，大多数运动员依靠坚固、可靠的装备来实现长期的职业生涯。围棋装备的具体细节可能会有所不同，但所有的设计都与传统盔甲的框架相同，都是将坚硬的皮革和金属板战略性地安装在一起，以减轻冲击。然而，主要的是，攻城球装备重视移动性，因此往往是更轻、更灵活的当代盔甲，如果不是保护性差的话。",

	"{@b Siegeball Gear}. This set of leather equipment, which includes a padded helmet, sturdy gloves, elbow and kneepads, and a few protective guards, is standard attire for most siegeball players. It balances light weight and flexibility with some impact resistance, but does little to protect an athlete from twisted or overextended joints.": "{@b Siegeball Gear}. 这套皮革装备包括一个带衬垫的头盔、坚固的手套、护肘和护膝以及一些保护性的护具，是大多数攻城球运动员的标准服装。它兼顾了重量轻、灵活性和一些抗冲击性，但对保护运动员免受扭曲或过度伸展的关节没有什么作用。",
	"{@b Spiked Gear}. Festooned with iron spikes on its shoulder pads, helmets, and kneepads, this siegeball gear is lethal in its own right, and is used only in underground arenas. When you tackle or are tackled by another creature while wearing this armor, you deal piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier to that creature.": "{@b Spiked Gear}. 肩垫、头盔和护膝上布满了铁钉，这种攻城球装备本身就是致命的，而且只在地下竞技场使用。当你穿着这套盔甲时，你对付另一个生物或被另一个生物对付时，你会对该生物造成相当于你力量修正值的穿刺伤害。",
	"{@b Padded Siegeball Gear}. With greater padding and armored plates protecting the most vital areas, this version of siegeball armor trades portability for protection. Heftier players, who are more effective using their bodies as battering rams, are likely to appreciate the extra protection.": "{@b Padded Siegeball Gear}. 有了更大的填充物和装甲板保护最重要的部位，这个版本的攻城球盔甲以便携性换取保护。笨重的球员，更有效地使用他们的身体作为撞锤，可能会欣赏额外的保护。",
	"One of siegeball's biggest attractions is the bewildering variety of weapons used across the game. Some variants of the game allow all manner of lethal weapons, which increases this variety (as well as the danger posed to players) tenfold. But even in regulated games, where the types of weapons are more strictly controlled, siegeball allows for multiple weapon types, selected from the following options.": "攻城球最大的吸引力之一是游戏中使用的武器种类繁多，令人眼花缭乱。有些游戏的变体允许各种致命武器，这使这种多样性（以及对玩家造成的危险）增加了十倍。但即使在受管制的游戏中，武器类型受到更严格的控制，攻城球也允许有多种武器类型，从以下选项中选择。",

	"{@b Siege Baton}. A three-foot long cylindrical bat with a short, padded handle, the siege baton is the lightest weapon allowed in most siegeball games. It is normally favored by those dexterous enough to effectively brandish one in each hand, allowing them to use both batons to strike the ball at once, or to strike the ball twice as often, allowing for greater maneuverability across the arena.": "{@b Siege Baton}. 攻城棒是一种三英尺长的圆柱形球棒，有一个短的软垫手柄，是大多数攻城球游戏中允许的最轻的武器。它通常受到那些足够灵巧的人的青睐，可以有效地在两只手上各挥舞一根，使他们可以同时使用两根棒子击球，或两次击球，以便在赛场上有更大的机动性。",
	"{@b Siege Bat}. A cylindrical club exceeding four feet in length, with an impressive heft, the siege bat is the standard weapon used in siegeball games. Most tournaments have adopted standard rules as to a bat's composition, weight, and length, with the mass and balance of a bat. Usually, in compliance with these rules, a siege bat's weight and balance is augmented by a lead mass installed near its far end, where the bat is also thicker and reinforced by an iron band.": "{@b Siege Bat}. 攻城球棒是一根长度超过四英尺的圆柱形棍子，具有惊人的重量，是攻城球比赛中使用的标准武器。大多数比赛都采用了关于球棒的组成、重量和长度的标准规则，以及球棒的质量和平衡。通常情况下，为了遵守这些规则，攻城球棒的重量和平衡是通过在其远端安装一个铅块来增加的，在这里球棒也比较厚，并通过一个铁带进行加固。",
	"{@b Siege Club}. A weapon only for the stoutest of athletes, the siege club is a two-handed club of immense size and weight. Designed with a wedge-shape for both a wide blocking and striking surface, almost all siege clubs are designed with a lead core running their length to increase their heft. Even with a series of iron bands reinforcing it, siege clubs are known to smash mid-game under the force of intense strikes and powerful blocks.": "{@b Siege Club}. 攻城棍是只有最强壮的运动员才能使用的武器，是一种尺寸和重量巨大的双手棍。设计成楔形，以获得宽阔的阻挡和打击面，几乎所有的攻城球杆都设计有一个贯穿其长度的铅芯以增加其重量。即使有一系列的铁带加固，攻城球杆也会在激烈的打击和强大的阻挡力下在比赛中被击碎。",
	"{@b Spiked Ball}. Though it is less a weapon, and more a piece of game equipment, the spiked ball can be lethal all the same. Its surface is covered in broad half-inch long metal studs that tear up the turf and break bones on impact.": "{@b Spiked Ball}. 虽然它不是一种武器，而更像是一种游戏设备，但钉子球同样可以是致命的。它的表面覆盖着宽阔的半英寸长的金属钉，在撞击时可以撕开草皮并打破骨头。",
