No matter what, an exchange is made when you cast any spell.": "你的魔法是强大而直接的，但它是有代价的。也许你会让自己流血，用你的血来施展魔法。施放魔法可能会使你急剧衰老，也可能会耗尽你周围事物的生命。无论怎样，当你施展任何法术时都要进行交换。",
	"You may work with your DM to outline specifics for this cost if you wish. However, I recommend not creating anything mechanically involved. The cost should not have the ability to kill or seriously injure you and should not give you a meaningful combat disadvantage. Your cost should just add flavor.": "如果你愿意的话，你可以和你的管理员一起勾勒出这项费用的具体细节。然而，我建议不要创造任何机械性的东西。这个代价不应该有能力杀死或严重伤害你，也不应该给你带来有意义的战斗劣势。你的代价应该只是增加味道。",

On a failure, you can steal a number of hit dice from them, equal to your Warlock spell attack modifier. (These convert to Warlock hit dice, replacing any previously used. You cannot have more hit dice than your Warlock levels allow.)

	"Any time you cast a damaging spell, you may use your bonus action to change the damage type to either acid, cold, fire, or lightning. When this is done, all damage dealt by the spell is changed, and any other effects the spell imposes remain the same. If you cast a damaging spell that already deals one of these damage types and you choose not to change it, you may then use your bonus action to increase the spell's damage by {@dice 1d4}. If the spell has an ongoing damage effect, the damage is only increased for the initial damage.": "在你施放伤害性的法术时，你可以使用你的额外行动来改变伤害类型为酸、冷、火或雷电。当这样做时，该法术造成的所有伤害都会改变，而该法术施加的任何其他效果都保持不变。如果你施放的伤害性法术已经造成了这些伤害类型中的一种，并且你选择不改变它，那么你可以使用你的额外行动来增加该法术的伤害（%0%）。如果该法术有一个持续的伤害效果，那么伤害只增加最初的伤害。",

The wand turns into a harmless twig when you die.": "如果你丢失了你的魔杖，你可以进行一个1小时的仪式，可以在短期或长期休息时进行，以获得一个新的魔杖。你的管理员可能需要特殊的材料、时间或地点来正确地进行这个仪式。仪式会毁掉之前的魔杖。当你死亡时，魔杖会变成一根无害的树枝。",

	"On your turn, when you hit a target with {@spell eldritch blast} and change the damage type with your Pact of the Elements feature, you may cause the element to linger. The target takes ongoing damage of the chosen type for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. The damage dealt is equal to the increase in damage possible with the Pact of the Elements feature per blast the target is hit with. The damage is applied at the beginning of the targets turn. Once you use this feature on a casting of {@spell eldritch blast}, you may not do so until you roll initiative again.": "在你的回合中，当你用{@spell eldritch blast}击中一个目标，并以你的元素契约功能改变伤害类型时，你可以使该元素萦绕。目标会持续受到所选类型的伤害，持续的回合数与你的魅力修正值相等。所造成的伤害等于目标被击中的每一次爆炸时，用元素之盟特性可能增加的伤害。伤害会在目标的回合开始时应用。一旦你对（1%）的施法使用此功能，你就不能再这样做，直到你再次掷出主动权。",
