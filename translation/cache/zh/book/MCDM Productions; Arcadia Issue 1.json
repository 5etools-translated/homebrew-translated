	"This wing houses four chambers. The first three are each furnished with a small bed, nightstand, and clothing rack full of robes. The last is a small kitchen area, with cupboards filled with rations and snacks. The place is remarkably neat. Disturbing any part of this area causes the workshop to magically return it to its tidy state once the characters leave the room.": "这个侧翼有四个房间。前三个房间各配有一张小床、床头柜和装满长袍的衣架。最后一间是一个小厨房，橱柜里装满了口粮和零食。这个地方非常整洁。扰乱这个区域的任何部分，一旦人物离开房间，工场就会神奇地将其恢复整洁。",

	"One of the workshop's responsibilities is maintaining the greenhouse's balmy temperature. To this end, it senses fluctuations in temperature caused by any spell or effect that deals fire or cold damage. When the workshop detects a change in temperature, it overcompensates by evoking the corresponding element (ice to counter fire, fire to counter ice). All creatures within 10 feet of the source of the temperature change must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 ({@damage 4d6}) cold or fire damage.": "工作室的职责之一是维持温室的温和温度。为此，它能感知任何造成火或冷伤害的法术或效果所引起的温度波动。当工场检测到温度变化时，它会通过唤起相应的元素来进行过度补偿（以冰对抗火，以火对抗冰）。在温度变化源的10英尺范围内的所有生物必须在DC13的灵巧救赎中成功，否则会受到14（（%0%））的寒冷或火焰伤害。",
	"The greenhouse door leads outside to a staircase that wraps around the side of the mountain and up to the second floor. It is 80 feet long and overlooks a river 150 feet below.

	"Two suits of armor flank the door to area 6 at the top, each holding an ornate sword. If the characters acted hostile toward S.A.M or gave it another reason to mistrust them, it politely requests that they turn back. If the characters persist, S.A.M. turns this decoration into two suits of {@creature animated armor} and two {@creature flying sword||flying swords}, which fight until destroyed. These constructs pushed people over the guardrail before, and they'll do it again.": "两套盔甲在通往6号区域的大门两侧，每套盔甲都拿着一把华丽的剑。如果角色对S.A.M.有敌意，或者给了它另一个不信任他们的理由，它会礼貌地要求他们回头。如果人物坚持，S.A.M.就会把这个装饰变成两套（%0%）和两套（%1%），它们一直战斗到被摧毁。这些构造物曾经把人推过护栏，它们还会这样做。",
	"The storeroom is filled with empty shelves upon empty shelves.

This large automaton's eyes glow the same bright blue.": "楼梯顶部的平台四面都是安装好的架子，用来放置工具和材料。可折叠的工作台和凳子靠在墙上。整个房间散发着明亮的蓝光。中间坐着一个大型建筑，旁边有两套动画盔甲。它是由不匹配的铁屑制成的，是由破碎的刀片、盾牌和松散的盔甲组成的一团乱麻，胸部中间有一块方形面板。这个大型自动机的眼睛发出同样明亮的蓝色光芒。",

	"S.A.M. speaks through the construct, using only the language Illumar gave it to describe itself: \"intelligent,\" \"like a person,\" and \"kind of helpful—almost.\" If asked about the missing mages, S.A.M. reports that they have not returned after being pushed from the ledge. S.A.M. asked the staff not to come up to the grand workshop, but they did so anyway. It then activated the stairway security measures, the same suits of armor it likely sent after the characters.": "S.A.M.通过构造物说话，只使用伊鲁玛给它的语言来描述自己。\"聪明\"、\"像一个人\"、\"有点帮助--几乎是\"。如果被问及失踪的法师，S.A.M.报告说他们被推下窗台后还没有回来。S.A.M.要求工作人员不要到大车间来，但他们还是这样做了。然后它启动了楼梯口的安全措施，也就是它很可能派去追捕那些人物的盔甲套装。",

	"The rules focus on the mount's movement. A creature's unique actions and traits don't arise while being ridden. With these rules, the main advantage of having a mount is to increase movement speed or gain an alternate movement type like flight. Opportunities to set up powerful maneuvers between mount and rider are rare. Creature stat blocks are also static; mounts acquired at lower levels become liabilities as the character advances and the mount does not.": "规则的重点是坐骑的运动。一个生物的独特行动和特性在被骑乘时不会出现。在这些规则下，拥有坐骑的主要优势是增加移动速度或获得一个替代的移动类型，如飞行。在坐骑和骑手之间建立强大的机动性的机会是很少的。生物的状态块也是静态的；在较低等级获得的坐骑会随着角色的进步而成为负债，而坐骑则不会。",
	"Characters often acquire mounts to haul a wagon or travel long distances, but the advantages of owning a mount don't justify the cost and upkeep. Let's change that.": "角色经常获得坐骑来拖动马车或进行长途旅行，但拥有坐骑的好处并不能证明其成本和维护的合理性。让我们来改变这种情况。",
	"The following trained mounts—the basilisk, giant toad, hippogriff, nightmare, owlbear, and the valiant warhorse—synergize with their riders, granting unique abilities and movement options. These creatures adapt to working with a rider, and grow into dependable allies.

	"Creatures with the Mounted trait have several adjustments to the standard mounted combat rules, including references to the rider, a creature designated by the mount that has ridden the mount within the last 10 days.": "具有骑乘特质的生物对标准的骑乘战斗规则有一些调整，包括对骑手的参考，一个由坐骑指定的生物，在过去10天内骑过该坐骑。",
	"The experience of working with a rider empowers a mount.

	"The mount must use the rider's proficiency bonus (PB) in place of its own proficiency bonus, so a less skilled rider might impair the mount's own ability to act and defend themselves.

	"In combat, the trained mount shares the rider's turn. The mount can move and take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action on their own, or they wait for the command of their rider. While mounted, the rider can also use a bonus action to command the mount to take one of the actions in the mount's stat block. The rider and mount work in tandem, and can take their respective actions in any order during the turn.": "在战斗中，训练有素的坐骑分享骑手的回合。坐骑可以自行移动并采取冲刺、脱离或躲避的动作，或者等待骑手的命令。在骑乘时，骑手也可以使用一个额外的动作来命令坐骑采取坐骑状态块中的一个动作。骑手和坐骑协同工作，并可以在回合内以任何顺序采取各自的行动。",
	"For example, the undead rider Tenn starts her turn by instructing her mount, Nash the nightmare, to move to her next foe. Tenn then uses her bonus action to have Nash attack the adversary with his flaming stomp, which uses the nightmare's action. Afterwards, Tenn uses her action to attack an enemy with her rotting whip.": "例如，亡灵骑手Tenn开始她的回合时，指示她的坐骑，噩梦Nash，移动到她的下一个敌人。然后，天恩使用她的额外行动，让纳什用他的火焰踩踏攻击对手，这就使用了梦魇的行动。之后，天恩使用她的行动，用她的腐烂的鞭子攻击一个敌人。",
	"A rider can also use their bonus action to dismount spectacularly and perform a vaulting attack. The rider must make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The DC is equal to 10 + the mount's challenge rating. On a success, the next attack the rider makes before the end of their turn has advantage. Otherwise, the rider falls {@condition prone} in an unoccupied space adjacent to the mount and the rider's speed becomes 0 until the start of their next turn.": "骑手也可以使用他们的奖励动作来壮观地下马并进行跳马攻击。骑手必须进行力量（竞技）或灵巧（杂技）检查。DC等于10+坐骑的挑战等级。如果成功，骑手在其回合结束前进行的下一次攻击将具有优势。否则，骑手会在与坐骑相邻的一个无人空间中摔倒（%0%），并且骑手的速度变为0，直到他们下一个回合开始。",
	"The GM decides how a trained mount without a rider acts. As a guideline, a trained mount takes the Dodge action if it receives no command from its rider while the rider is present. However, if the rider is {@condition incapacitated} or absent, the mount acts on its own under the control of the GM. Without a rider to command them in combat, most mounts focus on running away or defending themselves.": "GM决定没有骑手的训练坐骑如何行动。作为一个指导原则，如果骑手在场，训练有素的坐骑没有收到骑手的命令，它就会采取躲避行动。然而，如果骑手在{@condition incapacitated}或不在，坐骑就会在GM的控制下自行行动。在没有骑手指挥的情况下，大多数坐骑会专注于逃跑或自卫。",
	"A nightmare doesn't begin its life as a hell horse. These creatures are made with dark magic to serve powerful fiends as powerful steeds and status symbols. ": "恶梦并不是以地狱马的身份开始其生活的。这些生物是用黑暗的魔法制造出来的，作为强大的魔族的骏马和地位的象征为其服务。",
	"The owlbear can adjust its plumage to make quick turns and graceful falls despite its incredible bulk. It seems built to strike fear into anyone who dares to exist on the same plane as it. ": "尽管猫头鹰熊的体型惊人，但它可以调整自己的羽翼，进行快速转弯和优雅的下落。它似乎是为了让任何敢于和它在同一平面上存在的人感到恐惧而建造的。",

At the GM's discretion, a rider who feeds and cares for the animal has advantage on this check.": "为了驯服坐骑，骑手必须成功地进行智慧（动物处理）检查，检查值等于13+该生物的挑战等级。下面的 \"驯服坐骑 \"表根据骑手的智慧（动物处理）检定的结果列出了后果等级。根据GM的决定，喂养和照顾动物的骑手在这个检定上有优势。",

	"How glorious he was in his height! A favored vassal of his god, Uqaviel ascended from planetar to archangel after millennia of devotion and was awarded the title \"the Shard of Dawn.\" The missions he undertook involved the great balancing of time, space, and gravity among the planes. He not only maintained the forces of balance, but also fought against fiendish hordes that sought to upheave the equilibrium of planar power. Material, celestial, and infernal planes, he balanced them all: he was a vessel of light striking against the forces of evil, ensuring that their dark rituals never completed the rise of darkness.": "他的高度是多么的辉煌！他是他的神的宠臣。作为他的神的宠臣，乌卡维尔经过千年的奉献，从星球人升为大天使，并被授予 \"黎明之碎片 \"的称号。他所承担的任务涉及时间、空间和各星球之间的重力的巨大平衡。他不仅维持着平衡的力量，而且还与那些试图颠覆平面力量平衡的恶魔群作战。物质的、天体的和地狱的星球，他都进行了平衡：他是一个打击邪恶力量的光的容器，确保他们的黑暗仪式永远不会完成黑暗的崛起。",
	"His favorite work was in the Material Plane. Under the hand of the Shard of Dawn, the worlds of the Material Plane, balanced on a delicate tapestry of woven magic, continued in their ever-circular dance. As he navigated the worlds around the sun and stars and ensured their continued day and night, Uqaviel took great joy in the artistry and splays of color in each transition, and he contemplated that beauty—the beauty of everything neatly balanced and arrayed in the fires of the dawn.": "他最喜欢的工作是在物质界。在 \"黎明碎片 \"的手中，物质界的各个世界，在编织魔法的精致挂毯上保持平衡，继续着它们不断循环的舞蹈。当他在太阳和恒星周围的世界中导航，并确保它们持续的白天和黑夜时，乌卡维尔对每个过渡时期的艺术性和色彩斑斓感到非常高兴，他沉思着这种美--在黎明之火中整齐地平衡和排列的一切的美。",

	"After what seemed an eternity of service, Uqaviel was betrayed by Anahita, an archangel of the brightest daylight. Known as the Sentinel Apricate, Anahita ensured the brightness and everfire of the sun, stoking the blaze under direction of her god. Before this great betrayal, she was the constancy of the noonday sun—all that it feeds and nurtures, and the brightest blaze it brings to heat the worlds of the Material Plane. But the highest daylight passes overhead so quickly. She was the brightest, and it was not enough.": "在似乎是永恒的服务之后，乌卡维尔被阿娜希塔背叛了，她是最明亮的日光天使长。阿娜希塔被称为哨兵Apricate，她确保了太阳的亮度和永恒的火焰，在她的神的指导下点燃了火焰。在这次巨大的背叛之前，她是正午太阳的常量--所有它所哺育和培育的东西，以及它为物质界的世界带来的最明亮的火焰。但是，最高的日光很快就从头顶掠过。她是最明亮的，但这还不够。",
	"Anahita, lured by promises of greater power and prestige, collaborated with devils who promised her all that Uqaviel had and more—the fires of his dawn, the light of stars in the darkness. If she would open the door for their assault, she would be so much more than the Sentinel Apricate. She would be poised to command the sun in its evercycle through dawn, day, and night. Sun, stars, and dawning fire—all hers.": "阿娜希塔被更大的权力和声望的承诺所诱惑，与魔鬼合作，这些魔鬼向她承诺了乌卡维尔的一切，甚至更多--他的黎明之火，黑暗中的星光。如果她愿意为他们的攻击打开大门，她就会比哨兵Apricate多得多。她将准备好指挥太阳在黎明、白天和黑夜的不断循环。太阳、星星和黎明之火，都是她的。",
	"Her betrayal left several solars and more planetars dead after a consuming assault on a holy building. She wielded the dawnfire—a stunning celestial blaze that left the cathedral in ashes. Uqaviel, known for his love of the dawnfire and framed for the sin, was left to take the blame for the slaughter. His protestations of innocence were ignored by his once-friends; with archdevil magic empowering each twisting word, Anahita spoke truth to the host's holy ears, and Uqaviel could not escape judgment.": "她的背叛使几个索尔人和更多的行星人在对一座神圣的建筑进行消耗性攻击后死亡。她挥舞着曙光之火--令人惊叹的天体火焰，让大教堂灰飞烟灭。以热爱曙光之火而闻名的乌卡维尔，因罪孽深重而被陷害，只能为这场屠杀背负责任。他的无辜抗议被他曾经的朋友们忽略了；用大恶魔的魔法赋予每一个扭曲的词语，阿娜希塔在主人神圣的耳朵里说出了真相，而乌卡维尔无法逃脱审判。",
	"For this crime, Uqaviel was cast out and bound to the Material Plane, damned to repent for his actions for millions of millennia—the combined lifetimes of all the fallen celestials. Uqaviel knows Anahita is responsible for his downfall, but he has never found proof.": "因为这一罪行，乌卡维尔被赶出了物质界，并被束缚在物质界，被诅咒要为他的行为忏悔几百万年--所有堕落的天人的生命总和。乌卡维尔知道阿娜希塔对他的堕落负有责任，但他从未找到证据。",

	"In his time roaming the Material Plane, Uqaviel has developed a seeping hatred for it—to him, it is a cage. He sees the dawning mornings in a muffle veil of their usual splendor and feels a grief that twists into loathsome vengeance. For the betrayal of Anahita and the celestials, Uqaviel hopes to sever the ties between the Material Plane and the celestial realms, creating a catastrophic unbalance that would destroy them both. In doing so, he would ruin the perfect balance he spent so long maintaining as punishment for his fall. See \"A Severed World\" below for more details about this sundering.": "在他漫游物质界的过程中，Uqaviel对物质界产生了一种渗人的仇恨--对他来说，物质界是一个牢笼。他看到黎明的晨曦披上了一层闷闷的面纱，没有了往日的灿烂，他感到一种悲伤，这种悲伤扭曲成令人厌恶的复仇。对于阿娜希塔和天人的背叛，乌卡维尔希望切断物质界和天界之间的联系，创造一个灾难性的不平衡，将它们都摧毁。这样做，他就会毁掉他花了这么长时间维持的完美平衡，作为对他堕落的惩罚。关于这次分裂的更多细节，请看下面的 \"一个被切断的世界\"。",
	"Yet Uqaviel's motivations run deeper. While he strikes at the balance of the planes in his fury, this is an anger that washes over everything else. On a deeper level, unknown perhaps even to himself, Uqaviel seeks redemption in the eyes of his brethren and justice against Anahita. When playing Uqaviel, it's helpful to keep his deeper motivations in mind. He is entrenched in rage, but the deepest part of him has a strong spark of goodness. It's possible for the characters to reach that goodness and to stop his machinations through kindness rather than violence.": "然而，乌卡维尔的动机更深。虽然他在愤怒中破坏了各星球的平衡，但这是一种冲淡一切的愤怒。在更深的层次上，也许连他自己都不知道，乌卡维尔在他的兄弟眼中寻求救赎，并对阿娜希塔伸张正义。在扮演乌卡维尔时，牢记他更深层次的动机是很有帮助的。他在愤怒中根深蒂固，但他的最深处有强烈的善良火花。人物有可能通过善良而不是暴力来达到这种善意，并阻止他的阴谋。",

Something monumental echoes into the world, they whisper. As the characters chase the wild flares of power, they hear the name \"Recreant\" irreverently pass the lips of those who fear Uqaviel's growing power. While Uquaviel is already dragging his claws through the world, the characters face a desperate race to learn his plans and stop them from unfolding.|942821}": "{@color {@b Cracks in the World.} 两位大天使都没有接近人物--相反，在得知乌卡维尔的名字之前，他们就开始追捕他了。一位奥术研究者找到他们，告诉他们这个世界失去了平衡，星球混乱的轻微闪光（见下文 \"被割断的世界\"）正在复苏。他们低声说，有什么不朽的东西回荡在这个世界上。当角色们追逐着力量的狂热闪光时，他们听到 \"Recreant \"这个名字不经意地从那些害怕乌卡维尔日益增长的力量的人嘴里传出。当乌卡维尔已经在这个世界上拖着他的爪子时，角色们面临着一场绝望的竞赛，以了解他的计划并阻止其发展。｝",
	"It's also possible to use Uqaviel as an ally from the start, by having him approach the party, reveal Anahita's treachery, and beg their assistance in restoring him to the heavens. This omits the unfolding mystery and the tragic anger of the story, but it suits a campaign that already involves archdevils, as the characters will have to contend with the hordes of devils Anhita used to overthrow the celestial realms.": "也可以从一开始就把乌卡维尔作为盟友，让他接近当事人，揭露阿娜希塔的背叛行为，并乞求他们协助他恢复天国。这就省略了故事中展开的谜团和悲剧性的愤怒，但它适合已经涉及大恶魔的战役，因为人物将不得不与安希塔用来推翻天界的成群恶魔抗衡。",
	"This section contains one possible path for the campaign to follow, a path that establishes Uqaviel as a villain upfront and slowly reveals the truth of his past.": "这一部分包含了竞选活动的一条可能的路径，这条路径在前期将乌卡维尔确立为一个反派，并慢慢揭示了他过去的真相。",
	"Left to his own devices, Uqaviel acts solely in pursuit of his mission: to complete a ritual that shatters the needlepoint upon which the balance of the universe hangs, severing the ties between planes.

Each of these steps can be run as an encounter or prolonged quest as the characters race to stop his efforts.": "乌卡维尔只为完成他的任务而行动：完成一个仪式，打碎宇宙平衡所依赖的针线，切断各星球之间的联系。他对每一步都很清楚，因为这是他曾经极力抵制的仪式。他寻找神圣的组件来完成它，然后在世界的最高点的黎明时分执行它。这些步骤中的每一步都可以作为一个遭遇战或长时间的任务来进行，因为角色们要竞相阻止他的努力。",

It does not matter. My choices are my own.\" Characters can make a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana, History, or Religion) check.

A successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check gets him to open up, and if the characters caused Uqaviel to doubt in encounters before this, they have advantage on the check.

	"A high-level party can challenge and defeat Anahita, though she has no end of followers that the characters must cut through before they can reach her.

	"The characters don't have to face Anahita directly, however. They can also delve into an infernal plane to find records of her dealings with the devils and expose her treachery to the heavens. There are many challenges and dangers in Hell, but presenting the contract to the divine council who cast Uqaviel out of the celestial realms ensures that Anahita faces justice and Uqaviel is redeemed as the great balancer of the skies.
