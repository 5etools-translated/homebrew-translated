	"What Jousting? ousting is a fine and noble sport. Whilst it can be dangerous, those who dare take part in this most exciting challenge can find themselves becoming famous throughout the land. Fame and fortune awaits the brave! I hope you enjoy these rules for Jousting Tournaments. Feel free to adapt them to meet the needs of your own campaign. These rules assume a standard medieval type world.": "什么是比武？\"比武 \"是一项优秀而高尚的运动。虽然它可能很危险，但那些敢于参加这项最激动人心的挑战的人可以发现自己在整个土地上变得很有名。名誉和财富在等待着勇敢的人! 我希望你喜欢这些比武竞赛的规则。请自由调整它们以满足你自己活动的需要。这些规则假定了一个标准的中世纪类型的世界。",
	"Most jousting tournaments last for a full day and are hosted by a senior noble or a more junior figure who wishes to increase their renown. They are responsible for organising the event and putting up the prizes, and those prizes can be very great indeed.": "大多数比武比赛持续一整天，由高级贵族或希望提高自己声望的初级人物主持。他们负责组织活动并设置奖品，而这些奖品可能确实非常丰厚。",
	"The jousters themselves are usually restricted to members of the nobility; the equipment needed to take part in a jousting tournament is beyond the means of most of the population. Good prize money will attract a better class of participant. Once a PC hears of a jousting tournament they can apply to take part, typically this must be done at least the day before. The later they leave it to apply, the greater the risk that the tournament will be full and they will not be able to take part": "角斗士本身通常只限于贵族成员；参加角斗士比赛所需的设备超出了大多数人的能力。丰厚的奖金会吸引更多的人参加。一旦个人听到比武大会的消息，他们就可以申请参加，通常这必须至少在前一天完成。他们越晚申请，就越有可能出现比赛名额已满而他们无法参加的情况。",
	"Only riders with their own mounts are allowed to participate in the joust. Tourney lances are provided, but each jouster is expected to have a squire to bring a fresh lance each time a lance breaks.": "只有拥有自己的坐骑的骑手才可以参加比武。锦标赛提供长矛，但每个骑手都应该有一个侍从，在每次长矛断裂时带来新的长矛。",
	"There are strict rules of honour and etiquette associated with a Jousting  tournament. Magic lances and other magic equipment are not allowed, and spellcasting is not allowed during the joust. Jousters may receive magical healing between rounds, but they may not have spell effects on them during a joust. The judges word is final, any contestant breaching the tournament rules will be expelled.": "比武大会有严格的荣誉和礼节规则。不允许使用魔法长矛和其他魔法装备，也不允许在比武中使用法术。角斗士可以在两轮比赛之间接受魔法治疗，但在角斗过程中，他们身上不能有法术效果。评委的意见是最终的，任何违反比赛规则的选手将被开除。",
	"Whilst the participants might be almost exclusively noble, the huge audiences that watch these tournaments are drawn from all classes. Thousands of people might watch a tournament, gamble on the results and take part in the associated feasts and celebrations. Crowd support is a factor in winning a tournament. Any participant who has the support of the cheering masses will receive bonuses in each joust and are more likely to be forgiven by the judges for minor infringements of the rules. Conversely, there are some participants who thrive on the abuse hurled by the crowd–these legendary \"black knights\" are popular among organisers since they attract crowds from miles around just to hurl abuse at them.": "虽然参赛者可能几乎全是贵族，但观看这些比赛的大量观众来自各个阶层。数以千计的人可能会观看一场比赛，对比赛结果进行赌博，并参加相关的宴会和庆祝活动。群众支持是赢得比赛的一个因素。任何得到群众欢呼支持的参赛者都会在每次比武中获得奖金，而且更有可能因轻微违反规则而得到裁判的宽恕。相反，也有一些参赛者在观众的谩骂声中茁壮成长--这些传说中的 \"黑骑士 \"在组织者中很受欢迎，因为他们吸引了方圆几十公里的人群来谩骂他们。",
	"It's not just gold that awaits the brave and noble jouster. Titles to land, the love of a lady and the adoration of the crowds are often an even bigger draw. The greatest tournaments sometimes offer the winner magical armour and weapons. Truly it is said that fortune favours the brave.": "等待勇敢而高贵的骑手的不仅仅是黄金。土地的所有权、女士的爱和群众的崇拜往往是更大的吸引力。最伟大的比赛有时会为获胜者提供神奇的盔甲和武器。真可谓是幸运之神眷顾勇敢者。",
	"Each tournament follows a very similar structure, DMs may of course adapt this to their own purposes. We suggest that the DM prepares each stage in advance and then takes the players through each stage in turn (if they survive)": "每场比赛都遵循一个非常相似的结构，当然，管理员可以根据自己的目的进行调整。我们建议管理员提前准备好每个阶段，然后带着玩家依次完成每个阶段（如果他们能活下来的话）。",
	"Jousting tournaments have five stages including a prize-giving ceremony.": "比武竞赛有五个阶段，包括一个颁奖仪式。",
	"Parade": "游行",
	"where jousters can show off their skills.": "在这里杂技演员可以展示他们的技能。",
	"Qualify": "资格认证",
	"Contenders reduced to 32 in number.": "竞争者人数减少到32人。",
	"Eliminate": "消除",
	"Contenders fight in paired jousts until only two remain.": "竞争者在成对的比武中战斗，直到只剩下两个人。",
	"Final": "最后",
	"The last two contenders face each other in an extended joust.": "最后两位竞争者在一场长时间的比武中相互对峙。",
	"Prizes": "奖品",
	"Reward, but only for the winner.": "奖励，但只针对赢家。",
	"Each individual contest within a Jousting tournament is known as a joust. Within a joust there are multiple \"tilts.\"": "比武大赛中的每一场单独比赛都被称为比武。在一场比武中，有多个 \"倾斜\"。",
	"The pre-tournament parade is an opportunity for the combatants to show off their handling skills and talk to the crowd. With many in the crowd keen to take a bet on the tournament winner this is the best opportunity to gauge the skills of those taking part.": "比赛前的游行是战斗人员展示他们的操作技能和与观众交谈的机会。由于观众中的许多人热衷于对比赛冠军下注，这是衡量参赛者技能的最佳机会。",
	"If you're using the optional \"CrowdSupport\" rules, then each PC taking part in the tournament needs to work out their crowd-support figure before moving to the next stage.": "如果你使用的是可选的 \"群众支持 \"规则，那么参加比赛的每台PC都需要在进入下一阶段之前算出他们的群众支持数字。",
	"The purpose of the qualifying round is to whittle numbers down to 32 so that the elimination rounds can proceed in pairs to a last-16, quarter-final and semi-final. Thus not everyone will take part in the qualifying round. For most competitors, there is little benefit to taking part in the qualifying round.  Not only is there the possibility of death or injury but during this early stage crowds are thin with many eating or stocking up at the beer tent.": "资格赛的目的是将人数减少到32人，以便淘汰赛能够成对进行，进入最后的16强、四分之一决赛和半决赛。因此，并非所有人都会参加资格赛。对于大多数选手来说，参加资格赛没有什么好处。 不仅有死亡或受伤的可能性，而且在这个早期阶段，人群稀少，许多人在啤酒帐篷里吃饭或囤积食物。",
	"It is purely up to the Judges who must go through the qualifying round (and therefore the DM's choice) but to keep things simple, you could apply the rule that if a PC has a crowd rating of 20 or higher they can skip the qualifying round and go straight to the elimination round.": "这纯粹是由必须通过资格赛的裁判决定的（因此也是DM的选择），但为了简单起见，你可以应用这样的规则：如果一个PC的人群评分为20或更高，他们可以跳过资格赛，直接进入淘汰赛。",
	"Only a single tilt is needed to win through the qualifying stage.": "只需要一次倾斜就可以赢得通过资格赛阶段。",
	"If a PC is beating opponents easily, adjust the difficulty level by giving each opponent more hit points or an additional jousting dice.": "如果一个PC很容易击败对手，可以通过给每个对手更多的命中率或额外的角斗骰子来调整难度。",
	"To give a joust more character, try coming up with an interesting description of each opponent. Having a name and title for each opponent is a good start but it might be better to describe their family crest, where they are from and what the crowd think of them.": "为了使比武更具特色，试着对每个对手进行有趣的描述。给每个对手起个名字和头衔是个好的开始，但描述他们的家徽、他们来自哪里以及群众对他们的看法可能更好。",
	"A contestant will usually have the time to take a short-rest between rounds. The fact that a short-rest can be taken between rounds means that competitors can recover hp to an extent between rounds. However, with four elimination rounds and a final that could be a lot of damage to be healed. Allow PCs to make use of any healing potions they might have and to accept any healing available from friends. Assume that all NPC opponents start with their full hit points.": "选手通常会有时间在两轮之间进行短暂休息。在两轮比赛之间可以短暂休息的事实意味着选手可以在两轮比赛之间在一定程度上恢复体力。然而，由于有四场淘汰赛和一场决赛，这可能是一个需要治疗的大量伤害。允许NPC使用他们可能拥有的任何治疗药水，并接受朋友提供的任何治疗。假设所有的NPC对手都以他们的全部命中率开始。",
	"The elimination stages work on a best of three tilts basis.": "淘汰赛阶段以三局两胜制为基础进行比赛。",
	"The tournament organisers will want a good finale to their contest so if a PC has got that far, have an NPC healer restore at least some hit points.": "比赛的组织者会希望他们的比赛有一个好的结局，所以如果一个人已经走到了那一步，让一个NPC治疗师至少恢复一些命中率。",
	"As the climax of the entire tournament, the final works on a best of five tilts basis.": "作为整个比赛的高潮，决赛以五局两胜的方式进行。",
	"Once the joust is over, prizes will need to be given to the winner. This will be a public ceremony with the winner being cheered wildly (unless they are a dark knight of course) by the adoring public.": "一旦比武结束，就需要向获胜者颁发奖品。这将是一个公开的仪式，获胜者将受到崇拜者的疯狂欢呼（当然，除非他们是黑暗骑士）。",
	"There are two options for running tournaments, the simple approach and the meticulous approach, the simple approach is recommended for most games.": "举办锦标赛有两种选择，简单的方法和细致的方法，简单的方法建议用于大多数游戏。",
	"The simplest approach to running a tournament is to only plan the jousts that are actually needed. Contests between NPCs will not be considered. This is by far the easiest means to plan a tournament, especially when there is only one PC participating. The table below shows the level of opponent a PC will face as they progress through the tournament.": "举办比赛的最简单方法是只计划实际需要的比武。NPC之间的竞赛将不被考虑。这是迄今为止计划比赛的最简单的方法，特别是当只有一名PC参加时。下表显示了一个人在锦标赛中所面对的对手的级别。",
	"Qualifying": "资格审查",
	"Amateur": "业余爱好者",
	"Standard": "标准",
	"Veteran/Standard": "退伍军人/标准",
	"Veteran": "退伍军人",
	"Elite": "精英",
	"Rather than record the jousting stats manually for each opponent, simply pick six opponents of the right difficulty from the Appendix.": "与其手动记录每个对手的比武数据，不如直接从附录中挑选六个难度合适的对手。",
	"A more complex approach would be to fully prepare all 32 contestants at the start of the elimination stages and fight each joust in turn, moving through the stages until the final.": "一个更复杂的方法是，在淘汰赛阶段开始时为所有32名选手做好充分准备，依次进行每场比武，通过各阶段的比赛，直到决赛。",
	"The amount of work involved in this is much higher than for the simple approach but might be appropriate for a Jousting Tournament which includes multiple PCs and is the climax to a campaign.": "这方面的工作量比简单的方法要高得多，但可能适合于包括多个NPC在内的比武大会，而且是一场战役的高潮。",
	"Follow the guidelines below when running each joust.": "在进行每场比武时，请遵循以下准则。",
	"Before a joust starts, a PC should do the following with the DM doing the same for the NPC opponent. With the exception of hit points and initiative, these figures do not usually change throughout a tournament so a PC need only do this once.": "在比武开始前，个人应该对NPC对手做以下工作，DM也要对NPC对手做以下工作。除了命中率和主动性之外，这些数字在整个比赛中通常不会改变，所以个人只需做一次。",
	"Calculate the attack bonus by adding together the PCs Lance to hit bonus and their Animal Handling (Wis) proficiency bonus.": "通过将PC的长矛命中奖励和他们的动物处理（Wis）熟练度奖励相加，计算出攻击奖励。",
	"Calculate the AC, usually AC20 for full plate and shield. Do not include any DEX bonus to AC.": "计算AC值，通常全板和盾牌为AC20。不包括任何DEX对AC的奖励。",
	"Calculate the Animal Handling (Wis) bonus. This will mainly be used to determine if a PC can remain seated after being hit. Note that this check will not be taken at advantage for having a saddle. If a PC was insane enough to take part without a saddle, they would take the check at disadvantage.": "计算动物处理（Wis）奖励。这将主要用于确定一个人在被击中后是否能保持坐姿。请注意，这个检查不会因为有马鞍而获得优势。如果一个人疯狂到不戴马鞍也要参加，他们将以劣势接受检查。",
	"Calculate the Dismount check. This is the highest of a PC's Athletics or Acrobatics proficiency. This will mainly be used to determine how badly a PC will be hurt if they fall off their horse.": "计算 \"下马 \"检查。这是一个人的田径或杂技熟练程度的最高值。这主要是用来确定一个人如果从马背上摔下来会受到多严重的伤害。",
	"Before each joust, calculate crowd-support and compare who is the most popular of the two combatants with the most popular receiving crowd support and the associated bonuses it gives.": "在每次比武前，计算群众的支持率，比较谁是两个战斗人员中最受欢迎的人，最受欢迎的人得到群众的支持和相关的奖金。",
	"Calculate how many \"Jousting\" dice they have. A PC will start each joust with one die for each attack they have with a lance. So a level three fighter will have one die whilst a level six fighter will have two.  One Jousting die may be carried over from one joust to the next, any other jousting dice will be wasted if they are not used in that joust. The \"mounted combatant\" feat gives an additional jousting dice. A PC playing the role of a \"Dark Knight\" will gain another jousting die.": "计算他们有多少个 \"比武 \"骰子。一个人在每次比武开始时，他们用长矛的每一次攻击都有一个骰子。因此，一个三级战士将有一个骰子，而一个六级战士将有两个。 一个比武骰子可以从一个比武中带入到下一个比武中，其他的比武骰子如果不在那个比武中使用，就会浪费掉。骑马作战 \"的特技可以获得一个额外的比武骰子。一个扮演 \"黑暗骑士 \"角色的人将获得另一个角斗骰子。",
	"Record how many hit points a PC has remaining, this figure will fluctuate as they progress through a tournament.": "记录一个人还有多少命中率，这个数字会随着他们在比赛中的进展而波动。",
	"Calculate initiative. This is a standard D20 roll but instead of adding a DEX bonus, add the Animal Handling (WIS) proficiency bonus. This should be re-rolled for each tilt. Whoever has crowd support can roll this at advantage.": "计算主动性。这是一个标准的D20卷，但不是加入DEX奖励，而是加入动物处理（WIS）的熟练度奖励。这应该在每次倾斜时重新滚动。谁有人群支持，谁就能以优势滚动这个。",
	"Each tilt consists of a series of charges by both participants with them meeting in the centre of the tiltyard. There is no rest between charges and if a participant is for any reason unable to begin the next charge, they will lose the tilt. If a participant is knocked from their horse whilst their opponent remains in the saddle they lose the tilt.": "每一次倾斜都是由两个参赛者的一系列冲锋组成的，他们在倾斜场地的中心相遇。两次冲刺之间没有休息时间，如果参赛者因任何原因无法开始下一次冲刺，他们将失去倾斜的机会。如果参赛者被撞下马，而对手仍在马鞍上，他们将失去倾斜的机会。",
	"For each charge, both participants should make an attack roll in initiative order. If a participant is knocked from their horse as the result of their opponents attack they will not be able to make their own attack. Each participant can make only one attack roll regardless of how many attacks per turn they may have.": "对于每一次冲锋，两个参与者都应该按照主动权顺序进行攻击卷。如果参赛者因对手的攻击而被打下马，他们将无法进行自己的攻击。每个参赛者只能做一次攻击卷，无论他们每回合有多少次攻击。",
	"If an attack hits, calculate the damage as normal (D12 + Strength).  The opponent will suffer half this damage (rounded down).  If this damage reduces the opponent to less than zero hit points they will have lost both the tilt and the joust. Unless a critical is rolled, this damage will not be lifethreatening. If a critical is rolled then do not halve the damage but instead double as per normal. The damage suffered by a critical hit may be enough to kill. Jousting is dangerous!": "如果攻击命中，按常规计算伤害（D12+力量）。 对手将受到这个伤害的一半（向下取整）。 如果这个伤害使对手的命中率低于零，他们就会失去倾斜和比武的机会。除非掷出危急值，否则这个伤害不会威胁到生命。如果被击中，那么不要将伤害减半，而是按正常情况加倍。关键一击所造成的伤害可能足以致命。比武是危险的!",
	"If the opponent has been hit but not been reduced to zero hit points, they will still have to try and stay on their horse. To do this, they must make a check using the Animal Handling (Wis) bonus. The DC of the check is the total amount of damage sustained IE: before it is halved. If they succeed they stay on their horse, if they fail they are knocked off and will lose the tilt.": "如果对手被击中，但没有被降低到零命中率，他们仍然要努力留在马背上。要做到这一点，他们必须使用动物处理（Wis）奖励进行检查。检查的DC是所受伤害的总量，即在伤害减半之前。如果他们成功了，他们就能留在马背上，如果他们失败了，他们就会被打下来，并失去倾斜度。",
	"If an opponent had been knocked from their horse they must take a dismount check against a DC of 10. If they fail the dismount check then they will fall ungracefully to the dirt suffering an additional D6 damage. Passing this check does not in any way affect the fact that they have lost the tilt.": "如果对手被撞下马，他们必须进行下马检查，DC为10。如果他们没有通过下马检定，那么他们将不优雅地摔在地上，遭受额外的D6伤害。通过这个检查并不影响他们失去倾斜的事实。",
	"If a PC has already been reduced to zero hit points in the attack which knocked them off their feet then obviously they cannot make a save. The fall to the floor does not however inflict any additional damage but if they have been reduced to zero hit points as the result of a critical the fall will inflict an immediate death save failure. Jousting is dangerous!": "如果一个人在把他们打倒在地的攻击中已经被降低到了零点，那么显然他们不能进行救赎。然而，坠落到地板上并不会造成任何额外的伤害，但是如果他们已经因为危急的结果而被降低到零点，那么坠落将造成立即死亡的救赎失败。比武是很危险的。",
	"If both combatants are reduced to zero hit points in the same charge then it will be up to the tournament judges to decide who was the winner. Whilst this should be judged on a combination of artistic merit, skill and strength, in practise the judges are simply likely to follow what the masses want. Roll a D20 for each participant with whoever has crowd support having advantage. Add 5 points for each successful tilt already scored. Whoever scores higher wins the joust.": "如果两个战斗人员在同一次冲锋中都被打成了零点，那么将由比赛的裁判来决定谁是赢家。虽然这应该根据艺术价值、技能和力量的组合来判断，但在实践中，评委们很可能只是遵循群众的意愿。为每个参赛者掷一个D20，谁有群众支持谁就有优势。每一次成功的倾斜，都要加5分。谁的分数高，谁就赢得比武。",
	"A PC can use a jousting dice at any time during a joust. By expending a jousting dice a PC can do any of the following.": "一个人可以在比武过程中的任何时候使用一个比武骰子。通过消耗一个比武骰子，个人可以做以下任何事情。",
	"Re-roll an attack.": "重新进行一次攻击。",
	"Add D10 additional damage to a hit.": "击中后增加D10的额外伤害。",

	"Re-roll a dismount check.": "重新进行一次下马检查。",
	"Cancel the results of an exceptional event check (if advanced rules are used)": "取消特殊事件检查的结果（如果使用了高级规则）。",
	"Between each tilt, a participant will be given a very quick break. During this period, any damaged lances can be replaced and a jouster can have a quick drink but this does NOT constitute a short rest!": "在每次倾斜之间，参赛者将得到一个非常快的休息时间。在此期间，可以更换任何损坏的长矛，骑手可以快速喝水，但这并不构成短暂的休息!",
	"The huge crowds attached to jousting tournaments can become fervent supporters of particular jousters.": "附属于比武竞赛的庞大人群可以成为特定比武者的狂热支持者。",
	"Whoever has crowd support can roll initiative at advantage for each tilt. Conversely, Dark-Knights thrive on their unpopularity and gain an additional jousting dice.": "谁拥有群众的支持，谁就可以在每次倾斜时以优势滚动主动权。相反，黑暗骑士因其不受欢迎而茁壮成长，并获得一个额外的角斗骰子。",
	"To calculate the popularity of a PC perform the following quick calculation at the start of the tournament and add the result of a d20 dice roll. Unless you are using the advanced rules, this figure will be fixed throughout the tournament.": "要计算一个人的受欢迎程度，请在比赛开始时进行以下快速计算，并加上D20骰子的结果。除非你使用的是高级规则，否则这个数字在整个比赛中都是固定的。",
	"Has the Noble Background (or equivalent)": "拥有高贵的背景（或同等的）。",
	"Has the Folk Hero Background (at DMs discretion)": "拥有民间英雄背景（由DMs决定）。",
	"Has previously jousted three times in the local area": "曾在当地进行过三次比武",
	"PC is a member of a group, country or race that is hostile to the crowd.": "PC是一个团体、国家或种族的成员，对人群有敌意。",
	"PC is a member of a group popular with  the crowd": "PC是一个受群众欢迎的团体的成员",
	"Result of the pre-tournament parade (if advanced rules used)": "赛前游行的结果（如果使用高级规则的话）",
	"Most participants at a tournament will work hard to win the crowd's favour, the most popular of these are sometimes referred to as \"Golden Heroes\" and enjoy huge popularity. Some participants go for the opposite approach making themselves deliberately unpopular. These \"Dark Knights\" seem to feed off the hostility of the crowd giving themselves increased strength.": "大多数参加比赛的人都会努力赢得观众的青睐，其中最受欢迎的人有时被称为 \"黄金英雄\"，享有巨大的人气。有些参赛者则采取相反的方式，故意让自己不受欢迎。这些 \"黑暗骑士 \"似乎以人群的敌意为食，给自己增加力量。",
	"A golden hero is any combatant that has a crowd rating of over 30.": "黄金英雄是指任何人群评价超过30的战斗人员。",
	"A dark knight is any combatant that has a crowd rating of below zero.": "黑暗骑士是任何人群等级低于零的战斗人员。",
	"The following rules allow for a more complete role-playing experience albeit it, at the cost of increased complexity.": "下面的规则允许更完整的角色扮演体验，尽管它以增加复杂性为代价。",
	"The pre-tournament parade is an opportunity for the combatants to show off their handling skills and talk to the crowd. Have each PC who is taking part take two separate skill checks.": "比赛前的游行是战斗人员展示他们的操作技能和与观众交谈的机会。让每个参加的PC分别进行两次技能检查。",
	"The first check will be Animal Handling (Wis) against a DC of 12. This check will reflect the ability of the PCs to tightly control their mount and show off by standing or kneeling in the saddle whilst waving to the crowd.": "第一个检查将是动物处理（Wis），DC为12。这个检查将反映出NPC严格控制他们的坐骑的能力，并通过站在或跪在马鞍上向人群挥手来炫耀。",
	"The second check will be a Performance (Cha) check, also against a DC of 12. This check will reflect the ability of a PC to impress the crowd with their public speaking and charm. Some jousters have been known to compose poetry especially for the occasion or have bards accompany them playing their own \"signature\" tune. If a PC comes up with a sufficiently clever way of performing either of these checks you may wish to allow them to take the roll at advantage. Conversely, if they come up with a particularly stupid idea which is likely to offend the crowd they should take the roll at disadvantage.": "第二个检查将是表演（Cha）检查，DC也是12。这个检查将反映出一个人用他们的公开演讲和魅力来打动观众的能力。一些杂耍者已经知道为这个场合专门写诗，或者让吟游诗人为他们演奏自己的 \"招牌 \"曲子。如果一个人想出了一个足够聪明的方法来进行这些检查，你可能希望让他们以优势来进行测试。反之，如果他们想出了一个特别愚蠢的主意，可能会冒犯众人，那么他们就应该以劣势来进行检查。",
	"If a PC is making an attempt to antagonise the crowd then simply failing the above tests is not enough. They must succeed in both the above tests but with a DC of 15. In this scenario, the performance check reflects their attempt to alienate the crowd by being rude, abusive and un-chivalrous.": "如果一个PC试图与人群作对，那么仅仅在上述测试中失败是不够的。他们必须在上述两个测试中成功，但DC为15。在这种情况下，表现检查反映了他们试图通过粗鲁、辱骂和不具骑士风度来疏远人群。",
	"The Parade is also a chance to \"give favours\" to the crowd. To give favours, a PC must distribute at least 100gp of coins, jewellery, food & drinks to the crowd.": "游行也是一个向群众 \"施恩 \"的机会。要施舍恩惠，个人必须向人群分发至少100克的硬币、珠宝、食物和饮料。",
	"If the PC makes a favorable impression in the pre-tournament parade by passing both the horsemanship and chivalry check add 5 to their crowd rating. If the PC succeeds in antagonizing the crowd in the pre-tournament parade, remove 5 from their crowd rating. The PC who distributes the most favour to the crowd (in terms of gp) can roll their crowd support d20 die at advantage.": "如果PC在比赛前的游行中通过了马术和骑士精神的检查，给人留下了良好的印象，那么就在他们的群众评价中增加5分。如果该PC在赛前游行中成功地与人群对立，则从他们的人群评价中移除5。对人群分配最多恩惠的PC（以金币计）可以在优势下掷出他们的人群支持D20骰子。",
	"Whether your PCs take any interest at all in the participants' parade will depend on your groups playing style. Strong roleplayers might want to roleplay the whole event. A sneaky group might wish to use stealth to sabotage other competitors and turn the tournament into a miniadventure. Most will probably be happy to just roll the dice and take the result.": "你的PC是否对参与者的游行有任何兴趣，将取决于你的小组的游戏风格。强势的角色扮演者可能希望对整个事件进行角色扮演。狡猾的小组可能希望使用隐身术来破坏其他竞争者，并将比赛变成一个小型的冒险活动。大多数人可能会很高兴只是掷骰子并接受结果。",
	"During the tournament itself, a PC's popularity can wax or wane depending on their actions. A PC should keep a running total of their crowd rating, making adjustments as follows.": "在比赛期间，一个人的受欢迎程度可以根据他们的行动而增减。一个人应该保持他们的人气值的总和，按以下方式进行调整。",

	"The PC and the horse they are riding both fall to the ground automatically taking d6 damage each. Horse requires a successful Animal Handling (WIS) check against a DC of 10 to persuade it to charge again.": "PC和他们所骑的马都自动倒地，各受d6的伤害。马需要进行成功的动物处理（WIS）检查，DC为10，以劝说它再次冲锋。",
	"Your lance seems to have been aimed at your foes head. You lose the tilt & the judges will decide whether your unchivalrous attack merits disqualification": "你的长枪似乎瞄准了敌人的头部。你失去了倾斜的机会，裁判将决定你的非骑士式攻击是否应该被取消资格。",
	"You totally lose control and plough into the crowd. One unfortunate spectator receives the full force of your charge (d12 + strength) with five others suffering d6 damage from the impact. You immediately lose the joust.": "你完全失去控制，撞向人群。一个不幸的观众受到了你冲锋的全部力量（D12+力量），另外五个人在冲击中受到D6的伤害。你立即失去了比武的机会。",
	"During a joust there are certain actions that a PC can perform that are spectacular and out of the ordinary. These are all potentially triggered when a PC rolls a natural 20.": "在比武过程中，有一些行动是PC可以执行的，这些行动很壮观，也很不寻常。这些行动都是在一个人掷出自然数20时可能触发的。",
	"If PC rolls a natural 20 on their attack roll and their opponent is dismounted, then they can make a one-off Animal Handling (Dex) check against a DC of 15. If successful they catch their opponents lance in mid-air greatly impressing the crowd (add d4 to crowd support) and give them another Jousting dice.": "如果PC在他们的攻击卷上掷出自然的20分，而他们的对手是下马的，那么他们可以进行一次性的动物处理（Dex）检查，DC为15。如果成功，他们就能在半空中抓住对手的长矛，这将给观众留下深刻印象（在观众支持上加d4），并给他们另一个角斗骰子。",
	"If PC rolls a natural 20 on their animal handling check to stay mounted, then they can make a one-off Animal Handling (Dex) check against a DC of 15. If successful they stylishly pirouette in the saddle greatly impressing the crowd (add d4 to crowd support) and give them another Jousting dice.": "如果PC在他们的动物操作检查中掷出自然的20分来保持骑马，那么他们可以进行一次性的动物操作（Dex）检查，DC为15。如果成功，他们就会在马鞍上有型地回旋，给观众留下深刻印象（在观众支持上加d4），并给他们另一个比武骰子。",
	"If PC rolls a natural 20 on their animal handling check to land gracefully after being dismounted, then they can make a one-off PC makes a one-off second Athletics(Str) or Acrobatics(Dex) check against a DC of 15. If successful, they immediately remount in a single quick process. This stylish maneuver impresses the crowd (add d4 to crowd support) and at the Judge's discretion they may ignore the fact that the PCs feet did touch the floor.": "如果PC在他们的动物操作检查中掷出自然的20分，以便在下马后优雅地着陆，那么他们可以一次性地对PC进行第二次运动学（Str）或杂技学（Dex）检查，DC为15。如果成功，他们就会立即重新上马，这是一个快速的过程。这个时尚的动作给观众留下了深刻的印象（观众支持率加d4），而且裁判可以酌情忽略PC的脚确实接触到了地板这一事实。",
	"This section gives answers to some common questions a DM might have in using these rules. Note that in a world of imaginative PCs and rules lawyers there will always be more questions than answers!": "本节给出了DM在使用这些规则时可能遇到的一些常见问题的答案。请注意，在一个充满想象力的PC和规则律师的世界里，问题永远比答案多",
	"Qn. Is there anything a party can do to improve their chances of winning a tournament?": "问： 有什么办法可以提高他们在比赛中获胜的机会？",
	"Ans. Within the rules, very little. A party could assist in many ways to help a jouster get crowd support and they can provide healing between Jousts. However.... If a party was prepared to break the rules there are many ways in which they could cheat to help the party. Spellcasters can use their magic to boost the chances of their friend and sabotage their rivals (EG: by casting Hex on an opponent's Wisdom). Rogues could poison an opponent's horse or cut their saddle.  Of course if a party was prepared to do this then out there a jouster may find that an opponent might be prepared to use such underhand tricks too... ": "答案：在规则范围内，非常少。一方可以通过多种方式帮助角斗士获得人群支持，他们可以在角斗之间提供治疗。然而.... 如果一方准备打破规则，他们有很多方法可以作弊来帮助一方。施法者可以用他们的魔法来提高朋友的机会，并破坏他们的对手（例如：通过对对手的智慧施放Hex）。流氓可以给对手的马下毒，或者割断他们的马鞍。 当然，如果一方准备这样做，那么在外面，一个角斗士可能会发现对手也会准备使用这样的暗箱操作......",
	"Qn. As a DM, what class abilities should I allow a PC to use to help them in a joust?": "问：作为一个管理人，我应该让个人在比武中使用什么能力？作为一个管理人，我应该允许个人在比武中使用什么等级的能力来帮助他们？",
	"Ans. I guess this comes down to DM's prerogative. As a general pointer, these rules try to keep the actual jousting process simple with only a single attack-roll for each tilt. When a PC has an additional attack, this gives an additional jousting dice not an extra attack roll each tilt. We would suggest you try to keep to a single attack roll for each tilt and try to reflect the benefit of class features in other ways.": "答：我想这是DM的特权。作为一个一般的指针，这些规则试图使实际的比武过程保持简单，每次倾斜只有一个攻击卷。当一个人有一个额外的攻击时，这将提供一个额外的比武骰子，而不是每次倾斜的额外攻击卷。我们建议你尽量保持每次倾斜时的单一攻击卷，并尝试以其他方式反映等级特征的好处。",
	"Leaving aside whether a barbarian should be jousting at all, does rage reduce damage taken? We would say not, the damage a PC takes in a joust is already reduced to reflect the fact that combat is non-lethal. We would also not regard it as appropriate for unarmoured defence to be used in a joust.": "撇开野蛮人是否应该进行比武不谈，愤怒是否会减少受到的伤害？我们认为不会，一个人在比武中受到的伤害已经减少了，以反映战斗是不致命的。我们也不认为在比武中使用非装甲防御是合适的。",
	"The most problematic class ability of a Bard or Rogue as far as Jousting is concerned is skill expertise. If a PC took expertise in animal-handling then they would have a huge advantage over other classes. This doesn't feel right and we don't like the idea of jousting tournaments being swamped by common rogues so we would suggest that Expertise(Animal Handling) is not relevant to the specifics of Jousting and the additional bonus not be allowed.": "就比武而言，吟游诗人或游侠的最有问题的等级能力是技能专长。如果一个人掌握了处理动物的技能，那么他们就会比其他阶级有巨大的优势。这感觉不对，而且我们不喜欢比武大赛被普通游侠所淹没的想法，所以我们建议专长（动物处理）与比武的具体内容无关，并且不允许有额外奖励。",
	"Would the bonus provided by the Guidance cantrip be allowed within a joust (EG: for an animal-handling check)? Well strictly speaking the use of magic might not be allowed by the tournament organisers but even if a PC managed to get-away with it, why would a cleric want to cheat in a Jousting tournament? We wouldn't disallow this but would want a good reason by a PC why their God would support this.": "在比武中，指导咒语所提供的奖励是否允许（例如：用于动物处理的检查）？严格来说，比赛组织者可能不允许使用魔法，但即使一个人设法逃脱了，为什么一个牧师要在比武大会上作弊？我们不会不允许这样做，但我们需要一个很好的理由，为什么他们的神会支持这样做。",
	"Would the benefits of any of the fighting styles be allowed within a joust? We would say yes, \"Defence\" and Duelling would provide their benefit. Remember that when used mounted, a Lance is held in one-hand. Action surge is tricker, rather than give an additional action, allow a PC to \"cash-in\" an action surge for an additional jousting dice. The champions \"Improved Critical\" feature seems reasonable to use as does any Battlemaster manouvere that doesn't generate additional attacks.": "在比武中是否允许任何战斗方式的好处？我们会说是的，\"防御 \"和决斗会提供它们的好处。请记住，在骑马时，长枪是用一只手握住的。行动激增是比较棘手的，与其给一个额外的行动，不如允许PC \"兑现 \"一个行动激增来获得一个额外的比武骰子。冠军的 \"改进的关键 \"功能似乎是合理的，就像任何不产生额外攻击的战神法术一样，可以使用。",
	"Should a Paladin PC be allowed to use Divine Smite in  a Joust? Well it does feel natural for a Paladin to take part in a joust, unlike some other classes. We would suggest that this IS allowed as long as winning the Joust helps to further the tenents of their Oath.": "圣骑士应该被允许在比武中使用 \"神圣打击 \"吗？圣骑士参加比武确实感觉很自然，与其他一些等级不同。我们建议，只要在比武中获胜有助于促进他们的誓言，这就是允许的。"
