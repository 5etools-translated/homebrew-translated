Gavadon makes casual conversation during the journey to the cave.": "如果被问及盔甲，加瓦东声称他所穿的这套盔甲是武卡里昂恩赐的一部分。他还提到基维尔偷的那件属于同一系列。在前往山洞的路上，加瓦东与人闲聊。",
	"Gavadon speaks in a calm tone and has a good sense of humor, even cracking the occasional bawdy joke. If there is a cleric or paladin in the party, he asks them directly how it feels to serve their deity. His interest in their response is genuine, for Keevial prefers to devour the devout.": "加瓦东说话的语气很平静，而且很有幽默感，甚至偶尔会开一些粗俗的玩笑。如果党内有牧师或圣骑士，他会直接问他们为神灵服务的感觉如何。他对他们的回答很感兴趣，因为基维尔更喜欢吞噬虔诚的人。",
	"A character who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check knows that Gavadon isn't being entirely honest with the characters about the dangers they face in the cave. During combat, Gavadon takes the Dodge action and tries to keep out of harm's way. If an injured character asks for his help, the priest casts the cure wounds spell.": "通过DC17智慧（洞察力）检查成功的角色知道，加瓦顿对于他们在洞穴中面临的危险并没有完全诚实。在战斗中，加瓦顿采取躲避行动，并试图避开伤害的方式。如果有受伤的角色向他求助，牧师会施展治愈伤口的法术。",

	"Optionally, in a world with more deities than the players can track, Vukaryion could be a god that Gavadon invented. A successful DC 18 (Intelligence) Religion check reveals that Vukaryion isn't a god mentioned in any popular religious texts. If confronted about this, Gavadon admits Vukaryion isn't actually a god yet but a powerful entity whose voice the priest sometimes hears. The cleric hopes that restoring all the relics of this deity will cause Vukaryion to ascend. This is true, and Vukaryion is simply an alias for Zevellon.": "另外，在一个神灵多到玩家无法追踪的世界里，Vukaryion可能是Gavadon发明的一个神。如果成功通过DC18（智力）宗教检查，就会发现Vukaryion并不是任何流行的宗教文本中提到的神。如果被问及此事，加瓦东承认武卡里翁实际上还不是一个神，而是一个强大的实体，牧师有时会听到他的声音。教士希望恢复这个神灵的所有遗物能够使Vukaryion升天。这是真的，Vukaryion只是Zevellon的一个别名。",
	"Or Vukaryion could also be a god that Zevellon killed. A character who succeeds on a DC 22 Intelligence (History or Religion) check has read stories that describe the battle. If this information is revealed to Gavadon, the priest gives a sullen nod and says, \"My hope is that I can bring him back.\" Of course, Gavadon means Zevellon here and not Vukaryion.": "或者武卡里昂也可能是泽维隆杀死的一个神。通过DC22智力（历史或宗教）检查成功的人物，已经阅读了描述这场战斗的故事。如果这些信息被透露给加瓦东，牧师就会闷闷不乐地点头说：\"我的希望是我能把他带回来。\" 当然，Gavadon在这里指的是Zevellon而不是Vukaryion。",
	"On the way to the cave, five blood-red horned devil skeletons (use the minotaur skeleton stat blocks) rise from the ground and circle the characters as four blood-red bearded devil skeletons (use the skeleton stat block) come out of the shadows and draw shortbows.

The skeletons fight until destroyed.": "在去往山洞的路上，五个血红色的角魔骷髅（使用牛头人骷髅状态块）从地上爬起来，围着人物转，同时四个血红色的胡须魔骷髅（使用骷髅状态块）从阴影中走出来，拉开短弓。有角的魔鬼骷髅与角色进行近战，而有胡子的魔鬼骷髅则使用弓箭进行远程攻击。骷髅兵们一直战斗到被消灭。",

On a failure, a red tattoo shaped like a skull with a snake through the eyes appears on the character's body. At your discretion, these brands might appear under clothing and not initially be obvious to the characters. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that the tattoos radiate conjuration magic.

	"When the skeletons appear, Gavadon cries out, \"Oh no! Not again!\" During the fight he moans, \"When will these accursed things stop hunting me?\" as he cowers in fear. If asked, the priest says that the skeletons are servants of Keevial attempting to steal his piece of the armor. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Gavadon isn't being honest with the characters. He animated the skeletons himself days ago using a special ritual created by Zevellon and set this trap to sell the deception that Keevial is after him.": "当骷髅出现时，加瓦东喊道：\"哦不！又来了！\" 在战斗中，他呻吟道：\"这些被诅咒的东西什么时候才能停止对我的追杀？\"他在恐惧中畏缩。如果被问及，牧师说这些骷髅是基维尔的仆人，试图偷走他的那件盔甲。成功通过DC17智慧（洞察力）检查后，可以发现加瓦顿对这些人物并不诚实。几天前，他用泽维隆创造的特殊仪式将这些骷髅变成了动画，并设置了这个陷阱，以兜售基维尔在追捕他的骗局。",
	"If the characters refuse to trust Gavadon, the priest lashes out and attacks. He carries a yellow diamond elemental gem that he breaks to conjure an earth elemental.

He fights to the death.": "如果人物拒绝相信加瓦东，牧师就会挥拳攻击。他带着一颗黄色的钻石元素宝石，他打破了它来召唤一个土元素。即使有了这个盟友，加瓦顿也很可能不是这些角色的对手，但鉴于他们知道他的计划和他对获得下一件盔甲的绝望，他试图杀死他们，这样他们就无法阻止他或问更多问题。他战斗到死。",
	"When Gavadon dies, the characters can take his piece of the Armor of Zevellon and his magic sensor that points the way to the next closest piece of armor. A character who attunes to the armor gains the flaw described above, which makes them want to seek more pieces of armor, which could lead them to Keevial's cave.

If the spirits answer, a crystal cocoon encases the druid, turning them into a cryad, a crystalline construct that seeks vengeance upon all humanoids. A cryad captures people and uses their bodies as fertilizer to grow a garden of glowing, necromantic crystals.

	"That one standing there? One time I heard he spent a night in thick brambles, thorns piercing his skin, holding back his arrow until just the right time. At the changing of the guard, his arrow pierced through the wall of a tent and killed the commander sleeping inside. He aimed by a snore alone.": "那个站在那里的人？有一次，我听说他在茂密的荆棘丛中过了一夜，荆棘刺破了他的皮肤，把他的箭憋到了合适的时候。在换岗的时候，他的箭穿透了帐篷的墙壁，杀死了睡在里面的指挥官。他仅凭一个鼾声就瞄准了。",

	"{@creature Uldun of Parts Unknown|Ar6|Uldun} hunts the hunters. For three decades, Uldun watched Clormond Titanson's legions push orcs of the Pale Moon back into the mountain caves and hunt his kin as monsters. He watched orc warlords send his brothers and sisters into pointless battles and get slaughtered by the hundreds. As a young warrior, Uldun found a like mind in the fabled human mercenary Angus Threefingers. Once an orc hunter himself, Angus saw that orcs were no different than anyone else in the world—a people with their own culture and right for survival. Angus and Uldun became friends, and together they assassinated those who put orcs under the knife. They got very good at it.": "{@creature Uldun of Parts Unknown|Ar6|Uldun}猎杀猎手。三十年来，乌尔敦看着克洛蒙-泰坦森的军团把苍月的兽人赶回山洞，把他的亲属当作怪物来猎杀。他看着兽人军阀把他的兄弟姐妹送进毫无意义的战斗中，被屠杀了数百人。作为一个年轻的战士，乌尔敦在传说中的人类雇佣兵安格斯-瑟芬格身上找到了相似的想法。安格斯自己曾经是一名兽人猎人，他看到兽人与世界上的其他人没有什么不同--一个拥有自己的文化和生存权利的民族。安格斯和乌尔敦成了朋友，他们一起暗杀了那些把兽人置于刀下的人。他们对此非常擅长。",
	"Old age and a love of drink took Angus, but Uldun continued on. Uldun assassinated the officers and royalty who sent soldiers into battle against orcs. More officers and nobles died under Uldun's arrows than all who fell under their cruelty and violence put together.": "老年和爱喝酒的毛病带走了安格斯，但乌尔敦继续前进。乌尔敦暗杀了那些派遣士兵与兽人作战的军官和皇室成员。死在乌尔敦箭下的军官和贵族比所有倒在他们残忍和暴力下的人加起来还要多。",
	"Uldun's understudy, an orc hunter named Barash Longtooth, betrayed Uldun to a local lord who sent the orc assassin for public execution. Noting his deadly skills, Athlonia and Kryx liberated him and brought him to their cause. His talents, they explained, were too valuable to end on the blade of an executioner's axe. Later, Irae showed her value to Uldun by bribing and blackmailing those who continued to hunt him. Those who do business with the Grim Accord mostly ignore Uldun's grim past, though veterans of the imperial wars remember the hundreds who fell under his arrows.": "乌尔敦的替身，一个名叫巴拉什-龙牙的兽人猎人，将乌尔敦出卖给了当地的一个领主，后者将这个兽人刺客送去公开处决。注意到他的致命技能，阿斯隆尼亚和克雷克斯解放了他，并把他带到了他们的事业中。他们解释说，他的才能太有价值了，不能在刽子手的斧刃上结束。后来，艾拉通过贿赂和勒索那些继续追捕他的人，显示了她对乌尔登的价值。那些与 \"狰狞协议 \"做生意的人大多忽略了乌尔敦的残酷过去，但帝国战争的老兵们还记得数百人倒在他的箭下。",

	"The Grim Accord have spent years working together. Although their motives are far from altruistic, they fight together like wolves born to the same litter. It's extremely hard to catch the Grim Accord unaware. Uldun is as masterful a defensive huntsman as he is an assassin.

She uses misty step to change positions if she gets pinned down. Kryx uses his hyena form for defensive mobility, moving to advantageous positions then reverting to his humanoid form to cast spells like heat metal on heavily armored opponents, blight on lightly armored foes, or call lightning on groups. Athlonia uses her Defensive Shadowstep to defend allies pinned down by enemies. Using this reaction, she can often defend two allies separated across the battlefield. Uldun stays out of sight, using his Cunning Action to hide and hitting defensive spellcasters with longbow attacks.": "如果有机会，Irae会在战斗开始前施展更大的隐身术，用快速的火球和火弹打击移动较慢的目标。如果她被压制住了，她会使用虚无缥缈的步伐来改变位置。Kryx使用他的鬣狗形态来进行防御性移动，移动到有利的位置，然后恢复到他的人形形态，对重装甲的对手施放热金属等法术，对轻装甲的敌人施放诅咒，或者对群体施放闪电。阿瑟罗尼亚使用她的防御性影步来保护被敌人压制的盟友。利用这一反应，她经常可以保护两个分开在战场上的盟友。乌尔敦保持在视线之外，使用他的狡猾行动来隐藏，用长弓攻击来打击防御性的法术师。",
	"When on the offensive, the Grim Accord doesn't play fair.

	"Blaming Farnek for the theft, Lord Jovendel hired the Grim Accord to hunt down the halfling and find the amulet by any means necessary. Farnek hires the characters to protect him from the Accord and find Yoven and the amulet. The elusive Yoven leads them all on a chase across the land to the ruins of Garion. Throughout the adventure, the characters choose the best path to find Yoven and avoid the Grim Accord until they can hope to face them and win at the sealed doors of Garion the Sapphire City.": "约文德尔勋爵指责法内克偷了东西，于是雇佣了 \"狰狞协议 \"来追捕这个半身人，并不择手段地找到护身符。法尔内克雇佣了这些人物来保护他不受 \"协议 \"的影响，并找到尤文和护身符。难以捉摸的尤文带领他们在这片土地上追寻加里昂的废墟。在整个冒险过程中，角色们选择最好的路径来寻找约文并避开严峻的协议，直到他们有希望面对他们并在蓝宝石城加里昂的密封门前获胜。",

Little do the characters know that Avende the Blue Star, elven general of the Voth, hired the Grim Accord to do likewise to Faigon. As the characters engage in missions of sabotage, defense, assassination, rescue, espionage, negotiation, and diplomacy, they find signs of the Grim Accord, until the two groups finally come faceto-face on the battlefield.

	"Moments before the great paladin Emilia Draeshade thrust her sword into Zevellon's heart, he transferred his life force into the armor.

	"If you introduce the Armor of Zevellon into your game, there is a good chance that one character winds up wearing every item in the set. If this character finds several of the pieces quickly, their power will be unmatched by any other in the party. For some groups, this is fine, but many players may feel that their own characters are underpowered and overshadowed by their friend in the sweet new armor. If you put a few levels of adventuring between each piece of armor and ensure that plenty of other cool magic items go to the other characters, you'll avoid the issue of one character suddenly becoming the star of the show. You'll also better equip the heroes for when their friend becomes possessed by Zevellon and inevitably turns on them.": "如果你在游戏中引入泽维隆盔甲，很有可能有一个角色会穿上这套盔甲中的每一件物品。如果这个角色能迅速找到几件物品，他们的力量将是党内任何其他人所无法比拟的。对某些团体来说，这很好，但许多玩家可能会觉得他们自己的角色力量不足，被他们的朋友穿着甜蜜的新盔甲掩盖了。如果你在每件盔甲之间放上几级冒险，并确保大量其他很酷的魔法物品给其他角色，你就会避免一个角色突然成为表演的主角的问题。你也会更好地装备英雄们，以应对他们的朋友被泽维隆附身并不可避免地背叛他们的情况。",
	"I am finally returned by a worthy warrior. Let us roil chaos together. I can give you great gifts. All I need from you is a promise. Swear to me that your body is mine when you die. Do so, and for the rest of your mortal life, I shall make you a god. Pledge unto me your corpse. You won't be using it anyway.": "我终于被一个有价值的战士送回来了。让我们一起搅动混乱。我可以给你伟大的礼物。我所需要的是你的一个承诺。向我发誓，你死后你的身体是我的。这样做，在你的余生中，我将使你成为神。向我保证你的尸体。反正你也不会用它。",
	"When you are attuned to and wearing all the pieces of the armor, Zevellon's spirit revives. He asks to inhabit your body when you die and, in the meantime, to take a piece of your lifeforce in exchange for wielding his power:": "当你与盔甲的所有部件相吻合并佩戴时，泽维隆的灵魂就会复苏。他要求在你死后居住在你的身体里，与此同时，拿你的一部分生命力来换取挥舞他的力量。",
	"If you agree to allow Zevellon to inhabit your body after your death, your hit point maximum is reduced by 20 and you can wield Zevellon's power (see below). If you die while attuned to the armor, your body returns to life, but Zevellon's soul, and not yours, inhabits the form.": "如果你同意让Zevellon在你死后居住在你的身体里，你的最大命中率会减少20，并且你可以挥舞Zevellon的力量（见下文）。如果你在与盔甲相适应的情况下死亡，你的身体会恢复生机，但Zevellon的灵魂，而不是你的，会居住在这个形态中。",
	"If you deny Zevellon, you must make a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, Zevellon is temporarily subdued but makes the offer again in 1 week. After three successful saving throws to resist Zevellon, Zevellon gives up asking you. On a failed save, Zevellon gains control of your body. You are {@condition incapacitated} but remain aware. Zevellon uses your statistics, except he has 20 Intelligence, 20 Wisdom, and 24 Charisma, and he can access your knowledge, class features, and proficiencies. This possession lasts for as long as you remain attuned to the armor.": "如果你拒绝了Zevellon，你必须做一个DC25的智慧救赎动作。如果成功，Zevellon会暂时被制服，但在1周后会再次提出这个提议。在三次抵抗Zevellon的蓄力成功后，Zevellon就会放弃对你的要求。拯救失败后，Zevellon获得对你身体的控制。你的状态是（%0%），但仍有意识。Zevellon使用你的统计数据，除了他有20的智力、20的智慧和24的魅力，而且他可以获得你的知识、等级特征和能力。只要你与盔甲保持一致，这种附身就会持续下去。",
	"While you wield Zevellon's power and you are wearing and attuned to the full suit of the Armor of Zevellon, you gain the following benefits: ": "当你挥舞着Zevellon的力量，并且你穿着Zevellon盔甲的全套装备并与之相适应，你会获得以下好处。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws": "你在救人方面有优势",
	"You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.": "你对来自非魔法攻击的重击、穿刺和砍击伤害免疫。",
	"When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make an attack roll with a +10 bonus against the attacker using the tendrils of Zevellon's Scourge. You can perform this reaction whether the tendrils are activated or not, and doing so doesn't activate the tendrils. On a hit, the attacker takes {@damage 4d10} necrotic damage and is {@condition restrained} until the end of its next turn. You can't use this benefit again until you complete a long rest.": "当一个生物用近战攻击击中你时，你可以用你的反应对使用泽维隆之祸的卷轴的攻击者做出一个+10的奖励。无论卷须是否被激活，你都可以做出这个反应，而且这样做不会激活卷须。一旦命中，攻击者会受到（%0%）的坏死伤害，并在下一回合结束前受到（%1%）的伤害。在你完成一次长时间的休息之前，你不能再次使用这个福利。",
	"As an action, you can shout and emit a wave of negative energy from the armor. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is {@condition restrained}. The {@condition restrained} creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming {@condition petrified} on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the {@spell greater restoration} spell or other magic. You can't use this benefit again until you complete a long rest.": "作为一个动作，你可以大叫并从盔甲中发出一股负能量。在你10英尺范围内，你选择的每一个能听到你的生物都必须做一个DC18的智慧救赎动作。拯救失败时，该生物会神奇地开始变成石头，并且是（%0%）。1%）的生物必须在下一回合结束时重复蓄力，如果失败则变成（2%），成功则结束效果。石化会持续到该生物被{@spell greater restoration}咒语或其他魔法释放。在你完成一次长时间的休息之前，你不能再次使用这个好处。",
	"If Zevellon possesses your body, he gains access to the same benefits.": "如果泽维隆拥有你的身体，他就能获得同样的好处。",
	"In addition, if your body dies while possessed by Zevellon or if Zevellon returns to life in your body and is then killed, his soul retreats back into the pieces of armor. If the armor is permanently destroyed (see \"Destroying the Armor,\" below), Zevellon dies and his soul can't be returned to life.": "此外，如果你的身体在被Zevellon附身时死亡，或者如果Zevellon在你的身体里复活，然后被杀死，他的灵魂就会退回到盔甲的碎片中。如果盔甲被永久毁坏（见下文 \"毁坏盔甲\"），则Zevellon死亡，他的灵魂也无法复活。",
	"Individual pieces of armor can't be destroyed, but when the armor is united and Zevellon is resurrected by inhabiting the wearer's corpse, the whole suit becomes vulnerable. {@footnote While Zevellon lives again, a single piece of his armor can be destroyed if it is targeted with a disintegrate spell.|Disintegrate normally doesn't destroy magic items, but that's why Zevellon made this his armor's weakness. Any spellcaster who knows their craft wouldn't bother wasting a 6th-level spell slot trying to destroy a magic item.} If a single piece of armor is destroyed, it reforms on Zevellon's body {@dice 1d10} days later. If all the pieces of armor are destroyed before a single piece can reform, the suit never reforms.": "单个的盔甲不能被摧毁，但是当盔甲被联合起来，并且Zevellon通过居住在穿戴者的尸体上而复活时，整个盔甲就会变得脆弱。{@footnote While Zevellon lives again, a single piece of his armor can be destroyed if it is targeted with a disintegrate spell.|Disintegrate normally doesn't destroy magic items, but that's why Zevellon made this his armor's weakness.

	"If a character winds up suddenly possessed by Zevellon, that player may feel betrayed and cheated. While those are appropriate emotions for a character in the situation to have, it's not fun for a player to feel that way. When the characters first find pieces of the armor, you may want to bring a player aside and ask them how they feel about their character becoming a villain. If the player likes the idea, you can have them play the part of Zevellon when the moment is right and turn against their friends. If the player hates the idea, the characters can find books or an NPC that can tell them more about the items. Now the quest isn't to find more pieces of the armor, but to find a way to unattune to the armor, or even attune someone else to the magic armor so it can be destroyed.": "如果一个角色突然被Zevellon附身，该玩家可能会感到被背叛和欺骗。虽然在这种情况下，角色有这些情绪是合适的，但玩家有这种感觉并不有趣。当角色第一次找到盔甲的碎片时，你可能想把玩家带到一边，问他们对自己的角色成为一个反派的感觉如何。如果玩家喜欢这个想法，你可以让他们在时机成熟时扮演Zevellon的角色，与他们的朋友作对。如果玩家不喜欢这个想法，角色可以找到书籍或NPC，他们可以告诉他们更多关于这些物品的信息。现在的任务不是要找到更多的盔甲碎片，而是要找到一种方法来解除与盔甲的关系，甚至是让别人与魔法盔甲相适应，从而摧毁它。",
	"Likewise, you can hint to a character that the armor is evil before they assemble all its pieces by having it send telepathic messages to them. If you use this approach, the armor plays the part of a pious magic item most of the time, but it does occasionally try to push the character toward more nefarious action, which is a good sign that it's not what it seems.": "同样地，你可以在角色组装所有部件之前，通过让盔甲向他们发送心灵感应信息来暗示他们盔甲是邪恶的。如果你使用这种方法，盔甲在大多数时候都扮演着虔诚的魔法物品的角色，但它偶尔也会试图把角色推向更邪恶的行动，这是个好兆头，说明它并不像表面上那样。",
	"Or Vukaryion could also be a god that Zevellon killed. A character who succeeds on a DC 22 In telligence (History or Religion) check has read stories that describe the battle. If this information is revealed to Gavadon, the priest gives a sullen nod and says, \"My hope is that I can bring him back.\" Of course, Gavadon means Zevellon here and not Vukaryion.": "或者武卡里昂也可能是泽维隆杀死的一个神。一个在DC 22 In telligence（历史或宗教）检查中成功的角色已经读过描述这场战斗的故事。如果这些信息被透露给加瓦东，牧师会闷闷不乐地点头说：\"我的希望是我能把他带回来。\" 当然，Gavadon在这里指的是Zevellon而不是Vukaryion。",
	"When a skeleton hits a character with an attack, the character must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a red tattoo shaped like a skull with a snake through the eyes appears on the character's body. At your discretion, these brands might appear under clothing and not initially be obvious to the characters. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that the tattoos radiate conjuration magic. Attempting to dispel the tattoos with dispel magic causes the brands to release a psychic pulse. The caster takes 11 ({@damage 2d10}) psychic damage and the spell fails. A remove curse spell, however, does remove the brand.": "当一个骷髅用攻击击中一个角色时，该角色必须做一个DC18的智慧储蓄动作。如果失败，一个红色的纹身就会出现在角色的身上，形状是一个骷髅头，眼睛里有一条蛇。根据你的判断，这些烙印可能会出现在衣服下面，最初对人物来说并不明显。一个{@spell detect magic}的法术显示，这些纹身会放射出结界魔法。试图用驱散魔法来驱散纹身，会使这些烙印释放出一种精神脉冲。施法者会受到11({@damage 2d10})的精神伤害，施法失败。然而，一个消除诅咒的咒语可以消除烙印。",
	"The sphere around Keevial, a chain devil, has the same properties as one created by the resilient sphere spell. The ceiling in this chamber is 20 feet high.": "基维尔周围的球体，一个链状魔鬼，具有与弹性球体法术所创造的球体相同的属性。这个房间的天花板有20英尺高。",

	"Keevial's chains whip through the chamber. Four creatures of Keevial's choice must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw.

The creature can't be moved vertically using this lair action.": "Keevial的锁链在室内呼啸而过。Keevial所选择的四个生物必须做一个DC15的力量救赎动作。如果失败，该生物将受到11({@damage 2d6 + 4})的斩击伤害，并被移动到Keevial选择的、恶魔在洞内可以看到的一个无人空间。使用这个巢穴动作，该生物不能被垂直地移动。",

	"A young {@creature roper} with 60 hit points hides in the ceiling among the stalactites between the pillars. The first time a character attempts to leap across the chasm using the pillars, the roper attacks, using its tendrils to reel the character up to the ceiling for a feast and grapple then drop any rescuers into the gorge. If the characters instead climb down to the bottom of the gorge to cross, the roper moves to the east side of the gorge and waits for them to climb up.

The roper fights until reduced to 30 hit points, then flees along the ceiling.": "一个年轻的{@creature roper}拥有60点命中率的人躲在天花板上的石柱之间的钟乳石中。当一个角色第一次试图利用柱子跃过鸿沟时，这个小家伙就会发动攻击，用它的卷须把角色卷到天花板上大吃一顿，然后抓住任何救援人员，把他们扔到峡谷里。如果角色不爬到峡谷底部去，而是爬到峡谷的底部去，那么罗珀就会移动到峡谷的东侧，等待他们爬上来。一个被动智慧（感知）得分在15分以上的角色注意到游荡者在天花板上移动。游荡者一直战斗到生命值降到30，然后沿着天花板逃走。",
	"A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that the crystal radiates an aura of evocation magic. The crystal has AC 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the crystal is destroyed, it explodes in a burst of brilliant light and each creature in the chamber must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 9 ({@damage 2d8}) radiant damage and become {@condition blinded} for 1 hour. Destroying the crystal makes the light disappear.": "一个{@spell detect magic}的法术显示，这个水晶散发出一种召唤魔法的光环。该水晶有17点攻击力，50点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。如果水晶被摧毁，它就会爆发出耀眼的光芒，室内的每一个生物都必须在DC12的宪法救赎中成功，否则就会受到9({@damage 2d8})的辐射伤害并在1小时内变成{@condition blinded}。摧毁水晶会使光线消失。",
