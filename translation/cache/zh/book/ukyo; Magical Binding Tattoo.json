	"Magical tattoos are a rare and special form of controlling the weave. It binds the folding of the Weave's energies into the skin of the tattooed for a limited time. The power and rarity of the magic and the will of the recipient will determine how much of the Weave can be bound to flesh.": "神奇的纹身是一种罕见的、特殊的控制编织的形式。它将编织的能量折叠束缚在被纹者的皮肤上，时间有限。魔法的力量和稀有性以及接受者的意愿将决定有多少 \"编织 \"能被束缚在肉体上。",
	"Magical Tattoos are a temporary connection to the Weave for any person who can with stand the binding, and not everyone can. There are those who seek out the power of these tattoos, undergo the process, and whether it's from poor materials, rushed work or an unskilled artist the tattoo process fails catastrophically and what was meant to enhance will harm or even curse depending on the power that was sought after.": "神奇的纹身是任何能够忍受束缚的人与编织的临时联系，而不是每个人都可以。有一些人寻求这些纹身的力量，经历了这个过程，无论是从糟糕的材料、仓促的工作还是不熟练的艺术家，纹身过程都会出现灾难性的失败，本来想提高的东西会伤害甚至诅咒，这取决于所追求的力量。",
	"If the tattoo is inked by a master artist using an ink crafted from the finest possible ingredients, the binding to the Weave can be more powerful than anticipated.": "如果纹身是由一个大师级的艺术家用最好的原料制作的墨水涂抹的，那么对 \"编织 \"的约束力就会比预期的更强。",
	"In the end, each tattoo is different depending on a variety of factors: the size of the tattoo, the rarity of ingredients for the ink, level of the spell or effect attempting to be bound, and the will of the recipient. And, no matter what the tattoo, it will doubtless grant a great advantage to the bearer.": "最后，每个纹身都是不同的，取决于各种因素：纹身的大小、墨水原料的稀有程度、试图绑定的咒语或效果的等级，以及接受者的意愿。而且，不管是什么纹身，它无疑会给持有者带来巨大的好处。",
	"Tattoos come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. The size of the tattoo helps to determine how much of the Weave id directly bound to flesh. A larger tattoo means more magic, but it also means a larger chance of failure.": "纹身有三种尺寸：小、中、大。纹身的大小有助于确定有多少编织的id直接与肉体结合。较大的纹身意味着更多的魔法，但也意味着更大的失败机会。",

	"No ordinary ink can be used to bind the Weave in a tattoo. From the very first ingredient, a spell scroll of the desired effect, to the components of that same spell, all of its sum forges a magical binding link directly to the weave. In the process of creating the ink, all parts and consumed and transformed into the ink. The higher the quality of the ingredients, the greater the chance of the tattoo being successful.": "任何普通的墨水都不能用来在纹身中绑定织法。从最开始的成分，即所需效果的法术卷轴，到同一法术的组成部分，其所有的总和都直接与织法形成了一种神奇的绑定联系。在创造墨水的过程中，所有部件都被消耗并转化为墨水。成分的质量越高，纹身成功的机会就越大。",
	"A spell scroll and its components are only the base ingredients for the ink. The DM should look at the desired spell and select addition ingredients beyond what basic spell components are required. For example, Fireball requires a small ball of bat guano and sulfur. The DM may decide that additionally the essence of a Fire Elemental is required to help bind the ingredients and magic together in the tattoo.": "咒语卷轴和它的成分只是墨水的基本成分。管理员应该查看所需的法术，并选择基本法术成分之外的附加成分。例如，火球术需要一小团蝙蝠粪便和硫磺。管理员可以决定，另外还需要火元素的精华，以帮助在纹身中把成分和魔法结合起来。",
	"In the end, each tattoo will have a different ink recipe that will be determined by your DM. The recipe starts with a spell scroll and the spells components and then is flavored for story and possible adventuring depending on your campaign. The cost of the scroll is also used to determine the price of higher quality ingredients which will have a direct effect on the chances of success and how many uses the tattoo will have (See Tattooing DC chart). The art of the tattoo does not have to directly affect the magic, but if you are going to have a tattoo, you should make it a badass one.": "最后，每个纹身都会有一个不同的墨水配方，这将由你的管理员决定。配方从一个法术卷轴和法术成分开始，然后根据你的活动，根据故事和可能的冒险进行调味。卷轴的成本也被用来决定高质量成分的价格，这将直接影响到成功的几率和纹身的用途（见纹身DC表）。纹身的艺术不必直接影响魔法，但如果你要有一个纹身，你应该让它成为一个坏蛋。",
	"Once the type of spell effect, and the ink recipe are decided on, the difficulty of the binding the magic to the tattoo is determined. The chart below, Tattooing DC, shows a spell by level and its comparable scroll rarity. As the rarity or level of the spell increases, so does its difficulty in bridging a direct link from flesh to the weave.": "一旦决定了法术效果的类型和墨水配方，就可以确定将魔法与纹身结合的难度。下面的图表，纹身DC，显示了一个按等级划分的咒语和其可比的卷轴稀有性。随着法术的稀有性或等级的提高，它在连接肉体和织体的直接联系方面的难度也在增加。",
	"For example, a fireball spell scroll would be an uncommon scroll, and thus have a tattooing DC of 15. If the tattoo is a large tattoo then three checks would need to be made. All checks must be successful for the tattoo to bind the magic. If a check is failed the components are consumed and the ink is lost with no adverse effect.": "例如，一个火球术卷轴是一个不常见的卷轴，因此其纹身DC为15。如果纹身是一个大型的纹身，那么就需要进行三次检查。所有的检查都必须成功，这样才能使纹身束缚住魔法。如果检查失败，组件就会被消耗掉，墨水也会丢失，不会有任何不良影响。",
	"The only caveat to this is a critical fail, in which case the tattoo binds incorrectly cursing the recipient with the suggested opposite effect of the spell. For example, a tattoo used to increase AC might decrease AC during combat and the worst possible time. It is up to the DM to decide the penalty for a critically failed tattoo check.": "唯一需要注意的是关键性的失败，在这种情况下，纹身会错误地束缚住受术者，使其受到建议的相反效果的诅咒。例如，一个用于增加AC的纹身可能会在战斗中和最糟糕的时候减少AC。由DM来决定对严重失败的纹身检查的惩罚。",
	"Conversely, a critical success will double the charges of the tattoo. For instance, a small tattoo has a base of 4 charges, but a roll of 20 now imbues the small tattoo with 8 total charges!": "反之，关键的成功将使纹身的电荷增加一倍。例如，一个小纹身的基础是4个电荷，但如果掷出20个电荷，小纹身就会被赋予8个电荷。",

Furthermore, even though the magic is strong, the flesh is weak, and can channel so much energy directly from the weave. This breaks down into {@b charges} and {@b uses}.": "每个纹身都是连接编织的桥梁，但不是永久性的。每个纹身都有一定数量的奥术能量与之结合。一旦这种力量被耗尽，纹身就会消失。此外，即使魔法很强，肉体却很弱，可以直接从编织中输送这么多能量。这分解为（%0%）和（%1%）。",
	"The total amount of power a tattoo has is its number of charges, which is primarily determined by the size of the tattoo. Once these are gone, the tattoo fades away.": "纹身的总能量是它的电荷数，这主要由纹身的大小决定。一旦这些电荷消失，纹身就会逐渐消失。",
	"The number of uses a tattoo has, or how often the magic can be called on, is based on how powerful the spell effect is.

	"The level of the spell limits how often the magic of the tattoo can be channeled. A tattoo's use per day recharges fully after a long rest. On a short rest, you may make an arcana check to regain half of your spent uses for the day. For example, if you can use your tattoo 4 times per long rest, on a short rest, with a successful arcana check, you would regain 2 more uses. If the tattoo has only one use for the day, then the magic is too powerful to be recouped during a short rest, and only a long rest will suffice.": "咒语的等级限制了纹身的魔法可以被引导的频率。一个纹身每天的使用量在长时间休息后会完全恢复。在短暂的休息中，你可以进行一次奥术检查，以恢复当天一半的已用次数。例如，如果你在长时间休息时可以使用你的纹身4次，在短时间休息时，如果奥术检查成功，你会再获得2次使用权。如果纹身在一天内只有一次使用权，那么这个魔法就太强大了，无法在短时休息中恢复，只有长时休息才够用。",

	"Magical tattoos are a direct and powerful link to the Weave, but a temporary one. Once all the charges are spent the tattoo is no more. Unlike a normal tattoo, each use of the magic consumes and degrades the ink of the art.

The quality of the ingredients may boost the ink's magical properties as well.": "神奇的纹身是与 \"编织 \"的直接而强大的联系，但只是暂时的。一旦所有的费用用完，纹身就不再是了。与普通的纹身不同，每次使用魔法都会消耗和降低艺术的墨水。纹身越大，可以绑定的魔法就越多，但要付出更高的材料成本和失败几率。成分的质量也可以提高墨水的魔法属性。",
	"For example a small tattoo can bind enough magic for 4 charges, but if the ink is made with enhanced ink, an addtional charge can be bound for a total of 5.": "例如，一个小的纹身可以绑定足够的魔力来进行4次充电，但如果是用强化墨水制作的，还可以绑定一个额外的充电，共5次。",
	"Physical limits of the flesh Only so much magic can be bound to the flesh. Each new bridge to the weave pushes the physical limits of the body beyond where they were intended to go. By the third tattoo, the magic begins to take a more serious toll on the body, and a CON DC needs to be made for each new tattoo. Failure simply means the body could not be adhere to the magic at this time. Unfortunately, all the materials and costs are lost in the failed attempt.": "肉体的物理极限 只有这么多的魔法可以与肉体结合。每一个新的编织桥梁都会将身体的物理极限推到超出它们本来的位置。到了第三个纹身，魔法开始对身体造成更严重的伤害，每一个新纹身都需要进行CON DC。失败的意思是身体在这个时候无法坚持魔法。不幸的是，所有的材料和成本都在失败的尝试中损失了。",

	"For example, A scroll of Fireball is a level 3 spell scroll with a scroll cost of 200 gp. To give one DC check advantage, the base cost of the ingredients would be 600. If it is a small tattoo then the one and only DC check will be made with advantage.": "例如，一个火球术卷轴是一个3级的法术卷轴，卷轴成本为200戈比。为了给一个DC检查带来优势，材料的基本成本是600。如果它是一个小纹身，那么唯一的一次DC检查就会有优势。",
	"Enhancing the Ink with extra materials obtained from a creature related to the spell effect beyond will give the artist an advantage with one Tattoo check.

	"For example, Fireball is a level 3 spell. For the tattoo artist to have one DC check rolled with advantage, the essence or material from 2 Fire Elementals (CR5) could be added to the ink. Even though a fire elemental is only CR5 the essence of 2 adds above the required CR6.": "例如，火球术是一个3级法术。对于纹身师来说，要想在一次DC检查中获得优势，可以将两个火元素（CR5）的精华或材料加入到墨水中。尽管一个火元素只有CR5，但2个火元素的精华却高于所需的CR6。",
	"In addition to the artist getting advantage on one DC check, enhanced ink adds one additional charge to the tattoo.": "除了艺术家在一次DC检查中获得优势外，强化墨水还为纹身增加了一项额外的费用。",
	"A critical roll of 20 on a DC check will grant the tattoo an additional charge.": "在DC检查中，如果关键的一卷达到20，就会给予纹身一个额外的指控。",

	"Binding the power of magic is no small feat and can grant its bearer fantastic powers, but when it goes wrong, it goes terribly so.": "捆绑魔法的力量非同小可，可以赋予其持有者神奇的力量，但一旦出错，就会变得非常可怕。",
	"At the bare minimum, if the arcane energies do not bind properly and corrupt, the magic will pervert the blood with corrupted power cursing the recipient by reducing their primary ability score by 1d6 until a greater restoration is used to remove the curse.": "最起码，如果奥术能量不能正确地结合和腐蚀，魔法会用腐蚀的力量使血液变质，使接受者的主要能力得分减少1d6，从而诅咒他们，直到使用更大的恢复术来消除诅咒。",
	"Alternatively, and heavily encouraged, the DM may choose to create a unique curse based upon the spell. In this case the tattoo binds incorrectly cursing the recipient possibly the opposite effect of the spell.": "另外，DM可以选择在咒语的基础上创造一个独特的诅咒，这也是非常值得鼓励的。在这种情况下，纹身会不正确地束缚诅咒接受者，可能会产生与咒语相反的效果。",
	"For example, a tattoo used to increase AC might decrease AC during combat and the worst possible time. It is up to the DM to decide the penalty for a critically failed tattoo check, and it should be fun, but not vindictive.": "例如，一个用于增加AC的纹身可能会在战斗中和最糟糕的时候减少AC。由DM来决定对严重失败的纹身检查的惩罚，它应该是有趣的，但不是报复性的。",
