	"Have you ever wondered how much an item truly costs? Have you been wanting to find or craft an item but aren't sure how it fits in to the grand scheme of things? Did you ever look at sovereign glue and say to yourself, {@i \"There is no way that glue is worth 500,000 gp when Sentinel shield is worth 500gp\".} Well you are in luck because this guide is for you.": "你是否曾想过一件物品的真正成本是多少？你是否一直想找到或制作一件物品，但不确定它在事物的大计划中的地位？你是否曾经看着主权胶水对自己说，（%0%）那么你很幸运，因为这个指南是为你准备的。",
	"Brainstorming with the Giant In the Playground, /r/DnDNext, and EnWorld forums, Saidoro has put together a set of tables that break down the costs, reasons for the costs, and DMG page to find the item.": "通过与 \"操场上的巨人\"、\"/r/DNDNext \"和 \"EnWorld \"论坛进行头脑风暴，Saidoro整理出了一套表格，其中列出了费用、费用的原因以及找到该物品的DMG页面。",
	"Your world need not sell the magic items for the prices given below. Your world does not even need to sell the magic items below at all. The primary purpose of the tables below is to establish the relative price of magic items so that you can have a reasonably sane economy and/or so that you can quickly eyeball how much the swag you're giving your players is worth. You are free to modify the prices as you will, just be sure to tell your players that you are doing so in advance to the game start.": "你的世界不需要以下面的价格出售魔法物品。你的世界甚至根本不需要出售下面的魔法物品。以下表格的主要目的是确定魔法物品的相对价格，这样你就可以有一个合理的经济，并且/或者你可以快速地判断你给你的玩家的礼品价值多少。你可以随意修改价格，只是要确保在游戏开始前告诉你的玩家你正在这样做。",
	"The items are divided into a few different lists for your convenience. The lists are as follows:": "这些项目被分为几个不同的清单，以方便你使用。这些清单如下。",
	"{@book Consumables|SMIP2|0|Consumables} are items that are used some set amount of times (usually once) and then are gone.": "{@book Consumables|SMIP2|0|Consumables}是指使用一定数量(通常是一次)后就会消失的物品。",
	"{@book Combat Items|SMIP2|0|Combat Items} are items that primarily make the user better at killing things. Some also have other killing-unrelated effects, but these are not the primary source of their utility.": "{@book Combat Items|SMIP2|0|Combat Items}是主要使使用者更好地杀人的物品。有些也有其他与杀戮无关的效果，但这些并不是其效用的主要来源。",
	"{@book Non-combat Items|SMIP2|0|Non-combat Items} are items that primarily make the user better at solving problems in a killing-unrelated manner. Some also make the user better at killing things, but this is not the primary source of their utility.": "{@book Non-combat Items|SMIP2|0|Non-combat Items}是主要使用户更好地以与杀戮无关的方式解决问题的项目。有些也能使用户更好地杀戮，但这并不是其效用的主要来源。",
	"{@book Summoning Items|SMIP2|0|Summoning Items} are items that summon creatures to kill things or solve problems for you.": "{@book Summoning Items|SMIP2|0|Summoning Items}是召唤生物来杀死东西或为你解决问题的物品。",
	"{@book Gamechanging Items|SMIP2|0|Gamechanging Items} are items that can have major effects on the way the players engage with the world or that can resculpt the campaign world in some major way all on their own. They are not necessarily overpowered, but the GM should take a look at them to make sure that the items they allow are compatible with the sort of game and world they want to create.": "{@book Gamechanging Items|SMIP2|0|Gamechanging Items}是可以对玩家参与世界的方式产生重大影响的物品，或者可以以某种重大方式自行重塑活动世界。它们不一定过于强大，但GM应该看一看，以确保他们所允许的物品与他们想要创造的游戏和世界的类型相匹配。",
	"Each is discussed further in their own section. By adjusting the prices of the various lists, the GM can make it easier or harder to get their hands on various types of problem solving abilities.": "每个人都会在他们自己的章节中进一步讨论。通过调整各种清单的价格，GM可以使他们更容易或更难获得各种类型的解决问题的能力。",
	"Again, the prices below are not absolute. The GM may adjust the prices of items individually or by list, they may make any item available or not, they may say that magic items can't be sold for gold at all and that the below prices only roughly estimate value when people are trading magic items for other magic items or they may even not show these tables to their PCs at all and just use them to estimate treasure values. The below lists are intended as a tool, not an imposition on your campaign world.": "再说一遍，下面的价格并不是绝对的。GM可以单独或按清单调整物品的价格，他们可以使任何物品可用或不可用，他们可以说魔法物品根本不能以金币出售，当人们用魔法物品换取其他魔法物品时，下面的价格只是大致估计价值，或者他们甚至可以根本不给他们的NPC看这些表格，只是用它们来估计宝物的价值。下面的清单是作为一种工具，而不是强加给你的活动世界。",
	"Consumables represent all items that can be used up when used in their intended manner. By default, consumables are somewhere around one tenth the price of an equivalent permanent item. The scroll prices below represent a typical scroll of that level. Scrolls with significant direct value, such as scrolls of fabricate or wish, may be priced differently.": "消耗品代表了所有在以预定方式使用时可以用完的物品。默认情况下，消耗品的价格约为同等永久物品的十分之一。下面的卷轴价格代表了该级别的典型卷轴。具有重大直接价值的卷轴，例如制造或愿望的卷轴，可能会有不同的价格。",

	"Items × 5": "项目×5",
	"Combat items are primarily good for killing things. A few have other uses as well, like the luckstone or the Ioun Stone Mastery, but their biggest effect is making their owner better at killing or not getting killed. Increase the price of these items if you want your players mostly getting oddball magic items that don't interact much at all with combat. All items which are weapons or armor add the cost of the base weapon or armor that makes them up to their price.": "战斗物品主要是用来杀人的。少数物品也有其他用途，比如幸运石或伊恩石大师，但它们最大的作用是使它们的主人更好地杀人或不被杀。如果你想让你的玩家主要获得与战斗没有太大关系的古怪的魔法物品，就应该提高这些物品的价格。所有属于武器或盔甲的物品，其价格都会加上制造它们的基本武器或盔甲的成本。",
	"{@item Nine Lives Stealer|SaneMagicItemPricesExpanded} (Fully Charged)": "{@item Nine Lives Stealer|SaneMagicItemPricesExpanded} (完全充电)",
	"Non-combat items give some sort of problem-solving ability not directly related to combat. Some, like the Eversmoking Bottle and the Boots of Levitation are also useful in combat, but that isn't where the bulk of their utility comes from. Increase the price of these items if you'd rather have your players resort to combat more predictably instead of coming up with complicated schemes that avoid direct fighting.": "非战斗物品提供某种与战斗无直接关系的解决问题的能力。有些物品，如吸烟瓶和浮空之靴，在战斗中也很有用，但它们的大部分效用并不来自于此。如果你想让你的玩家更有预见性地诉诸于战斗，而不是想出复杂的计划来避免直接战斗，那么就提高这些物品的价格。",
	"Summoning items give their users shiny new friends to help them destroy their enemies or solve problems. With the exception of the Onyx dog, the Silver Raven and the Ivory Goat of Terror, the value of these items is heavily dependent on how expensive mercenaries are in your campaign world. The basic rules makes hiring even quite competent allies startlingly cheap, and while these items aren't based on the ridiculous 2 gp/day rule, they do assume that hiring combat ready minions is a relatively cheap activity that most players will be doing a little bit of if the situation warrants it. Adjust the below prices accordingly if this is not true in your campaign world.": "召唤物品会给使用者带来闪亮的新朋友，帮助他们消灭敌人或解决问题。除了玛瑙狗、银乌鸦和恐怖的象牙山羊之外，这些物品的价值在很大程度上取决于雇佣兵在你的战役世界中的昂贵程度。基本规则使雇佣相当有能力的盟友也变得惊人的便宜，虽然这些物品不是基于可笑的2GP/天的规则，但它们确实假定雇佣准备战斗的小兵是一种相对便宜的活动，如果情况需要，大多数玩家会做一点。如果在你的战役世界中不是这样，请相应地调整下面的价格。",
	"Gamechanging items significantly impact either the gameworld as a whole or the sort of things that are capable of challenging their holders. I don't really see either of these as a problem, but they may not fit with some campaigns or some settings, so the DM should take a careful look at the items on this list and decide whether or not they are allowed.": "改变游戏的物品会对整个游戏世界或能够挑战其持有者的事物的种类产生重大影响。我认为这两点都不是问题，但它们可能不适合某些战役或某些环境，所以管理员应该仔细查看这份清单上的物品，并决定是否允许它们存在。",
