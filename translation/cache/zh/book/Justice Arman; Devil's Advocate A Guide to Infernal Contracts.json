After much deliberation, a lengthy decree was drafted by Asmodeus and agreed upon by the gods.

	"The Pact Primeval granted Asmodeus and his allies dominion over the then-abandoned realm of Baator, which would eventually become the Nine Hells. It also established a procedure for the punishment of the wicked souls destined for its layers. However, over time, the gods found that a decreasing number of souls reached the Upper Planes because Asmodeus and his devils were deliberately tempting them. When the gods disputed the First Contract, claiming that Asmodeus had violated its terms, he dispassionately replied, \"Read the fine print.\" In addition to the Pact Primeval located in the Nine Hells, there are two other copies of the contract. One is housed on Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of Goodness and Law. The other is located on the clockwork plane of law, Mechanus.": "原始契约赋予阿斯莫德和他的盟友对当时被遗弃的巴托王国的统治权，该王国最终将成为九层地狱。它还建立了一个惩罚注定要下地狱的邪恶灵魂的程序。然而，随着时间的推移，众神发现到达上层世界的灵魂数量越来越少，因为阿斯摩德和他的魔鬼们故意引诱他们。当众神对第一契约提出异议，声称阿斯莫德违反了它的条款时，他冷静地回答说：\"请阅读细则\"。除了位于九层地狱的《原始契约》外，还有另外两份契约副本。一份存放在天山，善与法的七重天上。另一份则位于法律的发条平面，即Mechanus。",
	"At first glance, the contracts written by devils bear striking similarities to their mortal counterparts. There are numerous parallels between infernal law and the legal system administered on the Material Plane. Arbitration, precedent, and the concept of the accused standing trial before a jury are all found in both the Nine Hells and various settlements in the Forgotten Realms. A popular Candlekeep theory holds that the first legislators were ancient devils in disguise. By sowing familiarity with their proceedings, these early fiends had more success procuring souls from future generations. Some scholars even believe that the charismatic Mephistopheles was one of Faerun's first lawyers.": "乍一看，魔鬼写的合同与凡人的合同有着惊人的相似之处。地狱法和物质世界的法律体系之间有许多相似之处。仲裁、先例，以及被告在陪审团面前受审的概念，都可以在九层地狱和被遗忘之域的各种定居点中找到。一个流行的Candlekeep理论认为，第一批立法者是伪装成的古代魔鬼。通过播种熟悉他们的诉讼程序，这些早期的恶魔更成功地从后代人那里获得了灵魂。一些学者甚至认为，富有魅力的梅菲斯特是法隆的第一批律师之一。",
	"However, conflating mortal and infernal law is a dangerous supposition. Devils have no moral code, and they only abide by {@i corpus juris infernis} (\"the body of infernal law\") and the archdevil that commands them. To the contract administrator, the ultimate goal is the procurement of the soul at its lowest possible cost. When a bearded devil jabs a rusty metal quill into the back of the creature serving as its inkwell, a soul is not special. It's not a unique ticket to the afterlife. Instead, it's a lifeless transaction. A quota to be met in hopes of future promotion. Fodder for a dusty hellfire engine that ran out of juice in Avernus. How could they possibly empathize with a signee? Devils are ruthless negotiators that only respect the letter of the law.": "然而，将凡人法和地狱法混为一谈是一个危险的假设。魔鬼没有道德准则，他们只遵守（%0%）（\"地狱法的主体\"）和指挥他们的大魔鬼。对合同管理人来说，最终目标是以尽可能低的成本获得灵魂。当一个大胡子魔鬼将一支生锈的金属羽毛笔戳进作为其墨池的生物的背部时，灵魂并不特别。它不是一张通往来世的独特门票。相反，它是一种无生命的交易。一个需要满足的配额，希望将来能得到提升。尘土飞扬的地狱之火引擎的饲料，在阿弗努斯已经耗尽了能量。他们怎么可能同情一个签约者？魔鬼是无情的谈判者，只尊重法律的条文。",
	"While some differences are obvious - killing is permitted in the Nine Hells, for example, so long as it's justifiable in the Diabolical Courts of Phlegethos - the true threat lies in more subtle departures from mortal law. For example, when two livinig creatures exchange goods, there is generally the assumption of competency, i.e., both sides must be mentally capable of understanding their agreement in order to consent. Although.consent must be present in an infernal contract, there is no requirement of competency. This fact creates a fine line that many devils gleefully walk, extending handshakes to nostalgic nobles on their deathbeds or offering lengthy scrolls to grief-stricken widows who can hardly process new information.": "虽然有些差异是显而易见的--例如，在九层地狱中允许杀人，只要在弗勒盖索斯的恶魔法庭中是合理的--但真正的威胁在于对凡人法律更微妙的背离。例如，当两个活着的生物交换货物时，通常有能力的假设，即双方都必须在精神上能够理解他们的协议，以便同意。虽然在无间道合同中必须有同意，但没有能力的要求。这一事实创造了一条细线，许多魔鬼欣然走过，向临终的怀旧贵族握手，或向难以处理新信息的悲痛欲绝的寡妇提供冗长的卷轴。",
	"While each contract is tailored to the signee by the drafter, few strict requirements must be met in for your contract to be legitimate. A proper, respected infernal contract includes five elements: Consideration, the Offer, Obligation, Fine Print, and Acceptance. However, many contracts contain additional clauses that further bind the signatory and/or contract administrator.": "虽然每份合同都是由起草者为收件人量身定做的，但要使你的合同合法，必须满足几个严格的要求。一份适当的、受人尊敬的无间道合同包括五个要素。对价、要约、义务、细则和接受。然而，许多合同包含额外的条款，进一步约束签署者和/或合同管理者。",
	"Consideration is a vital part of both mortal and infernal contract law that refers to the exchange of payment between two parties. Both the fiend and the mortal must incur some burden to have a valid contract. Otherwise, the offer is a gift, and devils don't give gifts - unless reciprocation is guaranteed. A variety of options for consideration exist, but the majority of contracts fall into exchanges of either life-years or souls.": "代价是凡人和地狱合同法的一个重要部分，指的是双方之间的付款交换。魔鬼和凡人都必须承担一些负担，才能达成有效的合同。否则，这个提议就是一个礼物，而魔鬼是不送礼物的--除非回报有保证。存在各种对价的选择，但大多数合同都属于生命年限或灵魂的交换。",
	"Yeah, so life-year contracts are a little boring. So what? We can't all be rolling in souls down here. Do I look like a pit fiend to you?": "是的，所以终身合同有点无聊。那又怎样？我们不可能都在下面的灵魂里打滚。你看我像个坑爹的人吗？",
	"Contrary to popular belief, not every devil is a silver-tongued salesman capable of defrauding a signee of their soul. Many less-experienced devils earn a not-so-honest living by drafting cop.tracts based on life-years. These somewhat-standard agreements provide a framework from which lesser devils can slowly develop a sense of style, working in more clever fine print with each successful deal. In addition, trading life-years presents an opportunity for lesser fiends to chip away at mortals who may present an ongoing threat.": "与人们的看法相反，并不是每个魔鬼都是银牙利齿的推销员，能够骗取签约者的灵魂。许多经验不足的魔鬼通过起草基于生命年限的契约来赚取不那么诚实的生活。这些有点标准的协议提供了一个框架，较少的魔鬼可以在此基础上慢慢发展出一种风格，在每一次成功的交易中加入更巧妙的细节。此外，交易生命年限为小恶魔们提供了一个机会，使他们能够消除可能构成持续威胁的凡人。",
	"A creature that enters into an agreement based on life-years surrenders a portion of its remaining mortality to a fiend. This way, those with longer life spans (i.e., dwarves, elves, and giants) cannot benefit from an ancestral advantage. If the signee is fortunate, their life is cut short by a number of years equal to the number of life-years considered. However, the majority of life-year agreements stipulate that the signee must serve a fiend for that amount of time post mortem. In these cases, the drafter typically acts as an agent of an archdevil.": "一个以生命年限为基础签订协议的生物，会将其剩余的一部分死亡时间交予魔族。这样一来，那些拥有较长寿命的人（即矮人、精灵和巨人）就不能从祖先的优势中获益。如果被签署者幸运的话，他们的生命就会被缩短，缩短的年数相当于考虑的生命年数。然而，大多数的生命年协议都规定，被签署者必须在死后为魔族服务那么长时间。在这些情况下，起草人通常作为一个大恶魔的代理人行事。",
	"Upon death, the signee reports to the layer of the Nine Hells corresponding to the domain of the benefactor. The signee may perform menial tasks or hard labor as a slave, conduct or receive torture, or be enlisted as a soldier in the Blood War. Once this time is up, the soul is free to proceed t9 its original, intended destination unless the signee enters into additional agreements during that period. However, souls devoted to good deities may be surprised where they end up after dealing with devils!": "死后，被签署者会向与恩人的领地相对应的九层地狱报告。被签署人可以作为奴隶从事琐碎的工作或苦役，进行或接受酷刑，或者被征召为血战的士兵。一旦这段时间结束，灵魂就可以自由地前往它原来的预定目的地，除非受赠者在这期间签订了额外的协议。然而，献给善神的灵魂在与魔鬼打交道后，可能会对他们的结局感到吃惊",
	"Life-Year contracts, like all things pertaining to devils, are more insidious than they sound. Although infernal law untimately guarantees liberation, signees of lif-year agreements are branded with an infernal glyph which advertises their remaining time in the Nine Hells. The plane's pernicious inhabitants know that desperation is the foundation of a contract. To breed further deals, other devils make every effort to arrange a miserable existence forlife-year signees serving time in the Hells.": "生命年合同，就像所有与魔鬼有关的东西一样，比它们听起来更阴险。虽然地狱法最终保证了解放，但签署了生命年协议的人都被打上了地狱的字样，宣传他们在九层地狱的剩余时间。这个星球上的邪恶居民知道，绝望是契约的基础。为了滋生更多的交易，其他魔鬼尽一切努力为在地狱中服刑的生命年签署者安排一个悲惨的生活。",
	"The epitome of an infernal contract results in a pledge of the signee's soul as consideration. Souls are the currency of the Nine Hells. They are traded, converted into loyal subjects, and used to power infernal war machines. Souls of strong, good-natured mortals are especially coveted due to their bright potential. Contracts involving paladins and other holy warriors are often accompanied by the finest offers a devil can extend. Furthermore, a devil that regularly exceeds its soul quotas gets promoted. Every pit fiend was once a lowly chain devil who descended the fiery ladder of success.": "地狱契约的缩影是以收受人的灵魂作为代价的保证。灵魂是九层地狱的货币。他们被交易，转化为忠诚的臣民，并被用来驱动地狱的战争机器。强壮、善良的凡人的灵魂因其光明的潜力而受到特别垂青。涉及圣骑士和其他神圣战士的合同往往伴随着魔鬼可以提供的最好的报价。此外，一个经常超过其灵魂配额的魔鬼会得到晋升。每一个坑道魔鬼都曾经是一个卑微的链式魔鬼，他们在成功的火梯上走下来。",
	"Successful contract administrators are always thinking two or three steps ahead. They understand that most mortals are wary of entering into a contract with a devil given their reputation. A devil is usually content to make smaller, abstract deals with less-evident ramifications.": "成功的合同管理人总是提前两到三步思考。他们明白，鉴于魔鬼的名声，大多数凡人对与他们签订合同持谨慎态度。魔鬼通常满足于做较小的、抽象的、后果不明显的交易。",
	"One classic example is requiring the voice of the signee for a single hour. The deal seems innocent at first, but it poses several questions. Will your voice be taken during combat, preventing you from casting spells with verbal components? Could the devil consent to an ancient prophecy on your behalf, sealing you to some strange fate? Will your voice be used in tandem with a disguise to damage a hard-earned relationship with a crucial ally? The subtleties of consideration in nontraditional forms can bring exciting dilemmas to your table. The {@table Contract Consideration|DA:GIC} table presents a small sampling of such exchanges.": "一个典型的例子是要求收信人在一个小时内发声。这笔交易起初看起来很单纯，但它提出了几个问题。你的声音会不会在战斗中被夺走，使你无法施展带有语言成分的法术？恶魔会不会代表你同意一个古老的预言，将你封印在某种奇怪的命运中？你的声音会不会与伪装一起被用来破坏与一个重要盟友来之不易的关系？非传统形式的考虑的微妙之处可以为你带来令人兴奋的困境。{@table Contract Consideration|DA:GIC}表呈现了这类交流的一小部分。",
	"Ivy stared at her reflection in the temple window. \"The years have not been kind,\" she lamented. If only she could return to her youth, knowing then what she knew now. \"you won't find what youre looking for in there,\" answered a smooth voice.": "艾薇凝视着她在寺庙窗户上的倒影。\"岁月不饶人，\"她感叹道。如果她能回到她的年轻时代，知道她现在所知道的事情就好了。\"你在那里找不到你要找的东西，\"一个平稳的声音回答。",
	"A good offer can make or break an infernal contract. After all, it's not as if the River of Styx is backed up with masochistic passengers eagerly awaiting torment in the Nine Hells. The contract administrator - and by extension, the DM - is responsible for creating an offer so enticing that the signee doesn't realize they are getting the worse half of the deal. In contracts of the soul, the devil must suggest something to the signee that is genuinely priceless or unattainable.": "一个好的提议可以成就或破坏一份无间道合同。毕竟，冥河并不像受虐狂的乘客那样急切地等待着在九层地狱的折磨。契约管理人--也就是DM--要负责创造一个诱人的条件，让签约者意识不到他们得到的是交易中最糟糕的那一半。在灵魂契约中，魔鬼必须向收货人提出真正无价或无法实现的东西。",
	"When constructing your offer, don't be too critical of dangling something juicy in front of your players and their characters. Deals with devils should always be tempting, either because the requested consideration seems innocuous or because the offer is too good to pass up.": "在构建你的提议时，不要对在你的玩家和他们的角色面前晃动一些多汁的东西过于挑剔。与魔鬼的交易应该始终是诱人的，要么是因为所要求的考虑似乎是无害的，要么是因为这个提议太好，让人无法拒绝。",
	"{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus|BGDiA} provides a system for DMs to track ongoing deals of all sizes. By the end of the adventure, these sins may weigh down a character's soul and prevent them from leaving Avernus. The system outlined in this document attempts to establish a linear relationship between the offer and consideration while raising the stakes with each consecutive contract. The intent is to simultaneously convey the excitement and gravity of making deals with devils.": "{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus|BGDiA}为DM提供了一个系统来追踪正在进行的各种规模的交易。在冒险结束时，这些罪恶可能会压垮一个角色的灵魂，使他们无法离开阿弗纳斯。本文概述的系统试图在提议和代价之间建立一种线性关系，同时随着每个连续的合同而提高赌注。这样做的目的是为了同时表达与魔鬼做交易的兴奋和严重性。",
	"I usually start with hors d'oeuvres: delicate pastries, a fancy chair, violins, the whole Nine Hells.": "我通常从开胃菜开始：精致的糕点、漂亮的椅子、小提琴，整个九层地狱。",
	"The Offers table gives examples of appropriate offers based on standard life-year agreements. The table mainly includes mechanical benefits designed to entice your players, and it is by no means exhaustive. An individual character's visions of grandeur are far too subjective to lay out all the possibilities. Your offers can - and should - be tailored to the player characters' desires and the weight of their sacrifices.": "优惠表给出了基于标准生命年协议的适当优惠的例子。该表主要包括旨在吸引玩家的机械性好处，但它绝不是详尽无遗的。个别角色的宏伟愿景过于主观，无法列出所有的可能性。你的提议可以--而且应该--根据玩家角色的愿望和他们的牺牲的重量来定制。",
	"A soul's value is relative. While all devils are content to pocket another freshly-minted soul coin, some souls matter more to a particular benefactor than others. To Zariel at the forefront of the Blood War, the soul of a mighty warrior is highly-coveted for its potential as a warlord in her army. On the flip side, Mammon may pay twice the going rate for the soul of a wealthy entrepreneur whose acumen could boost the hoards of Minauros. If you're going to sell your soul, you might as well request an agent of the appropriate archdevil and avoid potential lowball offers.": "灵魂的价值是相对的。虽然所有的魔鬼都满足于将另一个新造的灵魂硬币收入囊中，但有些灵魂对某个特定的恩主来说比其他的更重要。对处于血战最前线的扎里尔来说，一个强大的战士的灵魂是非常珍贵的，因为它有可能成为她军队中的一个军阀。反过来说，玛门可能会为一个富有的企业家的灵魂支付两倍的价格，因为他的敏锐度可以促进米诺罗斯的囤积。如果你要出售你的灵魂，你最好要求一个合适的大恶魔的代理人，避免潜在的低价收购。",
	"To choose an appropriate offer, start by identifying the percentage of remaining life-years that the signee is putting up for consideration. Then, locate the corresponding service tier. For example, if a signee gives up half of their remaining life span, they are entitled to service tier II. Once you have selected your service tier, work with your DM or contract administrator to choose an appropriate offer. Alternatively, you may have an offer in mind and choose to work backward. {@optfeature Infernal Ally|DA:GIC} rules are located in Appendix C.": "要选择一个合适的报价，首先要确定签约人要考虑的剩余寿命年限的百分比。然后，找到相应的服务层级。例如，如果受保人放弃了他们剩余寿命的一半，他们就有权获得第二级服务。一旦你选择了你的服务层级，与你的管理部或合同管理员合作，选择一个适当的报价。或者，你可以在心中有一个报价，并选择向后工作。{@optfeature Infernal Ally|DA:GIC}的规则位于附录C中。",
	"If desired, the DM or the player may select a different form of consideration than years of remaining life, such as the ones outlined in the {@table Contract Consideration|DA:GIC} table. In these cases, use your best judgment to choose an appropriate service tier and offer. If the signee's consideration is the memory of a loved one, you might choose the service tier corresponding to half the life-years that they knew this person.": "如果需要，DM或玩家可以选择一种不同于剩余生命年限的考虑形式，比如（%0%）表中列出的那些。在这些情况下，请使用你的最佳判断力来选择一个适当的服务等级和提议。如果接受者的考虑是对所爱之人的记忆，你可以选择与他们认识此人的一半生命年限相对应的服务层级。",
	"A signee that is making an offer in a pinch (see \"Sealing the Deal\") is said to be a desperate signee. A proactive signee who isn't in the heat of the moment is known as a confident signee. The {@table Offers|DA:GIC} table distinguishes between immediate, one-time assistance and long-lasting benefits for desperate and confident signees, respectively. However, these two distinctions are only suggestions. A signee may choose from either column when making a deal.": "一个在紧要关头提出报价的签约人（见 \"成交\"）被称为绝望的签约人。一个不在紧要关头的积极主动的受让人被称为自信的受让人。{@table Offers|DA:GIC}表分别区分了绝望的收货人和自信的收货人的即时的、一次性的援助和长期的利益。然而，这两种区分只是建议。签约者在进行交易时可以从任何一栏中选择。",
	"You may notice that there are no ongoing benefits for those who trade their life to a devil on the {@table Offers|DA:GIC} table. While it is often a heroic endeavor, giving one's life results in the immediate and final death of the signee. Spells like {@spell revivify}, {@spell raise dead}, and {@spell resurrection} are incapable of bringing a character back from such a fate. It is rumored that even a {@spell wish} spell cannot violate the rigid nature of infernal law, though this could have been fabricated by devils long ago.": "你可能会注意到，那些在{@table Offers|DA:GIC}桌子上把自己的生命交易给魔鬼的人没有持续的利益。虽然这通常是一个英雄的努力，但献出自己的生命的结果是立即和最终死亡的收信人。像{@spell revivify}、{@spell raise dead}和{@spell resurrection}这样的法术是无法将一个角色从这样的命运中带回来的。有传言说，即使是{@spell wish}的咒语也不能违反地狱法则的严格性，尽管这可能是魔鬼在很久以前编造的。",
	"This is yet another way that devils can entice mortals to forfeit their souls. By giving your life, you immediately run out of time. However, by exchanging your soul as consideration, you get to live to see another day. You can partake in all of the glory and pleasure that life has to offer - at least until collection time.": "这是魔鬼引诱凡人放弃灵魂的又一方法。献出你的生命，你马上就会耗尽时间。然而，通过交换你的灵魂作为代价，你可以活到下一天。你可以分享生命所提供的所有荣耀和快乐--至少在收集时间之前。",
	"A player character can sign their first contract at any service tier. However, subsequent deals come at a higher price. If a character has already signed an infernal contract, the following deal must be of a higher service tier than the previous one - inevitably pushing them towards a soul contract. While this may seem grim, this prevents the player character from repeating negligible transactions with little consequence. Additionally, it entitles the signee to a better offer than their previous contract.": "玩家角色可以在任何服务层级签署他们的第一份合同。然而，随后的交易会有更高的价格。如果一个角色已经签署了一份无间道合同，那么接下来的交易必须比之前的服务等级更高--不可避免地将他们推向灵魂合同。虽然这看起来很残酷，但这可以防止玩家角色重复可忽略不计的交易而不产生什么后果。此外，它使签约者有权获得比他们之前的合同更好的报价。",
	"Devils hide behind their laws as if their order is just. In truth, there are no 'fair' exchanges with devils. There are only foolish pacts in which a mortal has taken their payment for granted.": "魔鬼躲在他们的法律后面，好像他们的秩序是公正的。事实上，与魔鬼没有 \"公平 \"的交换。只有愚蠢的契约，其中凡人认为他们的报酬是理所当然的。",
	"In a contract, an obligation is the legal duty of the two parties to perform. The signee and the contract administrator are bound by its terms. If either party violates this ironclad agreement, they may face harsh punishment according to infernal law. Such violations are overseen by Belial and his dispassionate judges in the Diabolical Courts of Phlegethos, the fourth layer of the Nine Hells.": "在合同中，义务是双方履行的法律责任。签约人和合同管理人都受其条款的约束。如果任何一方违反了这一铁定的协议，他们可能会根据地狱法面临严厉的惩罚。这种违约行为由贝利亚和他在九层地狱的第四层--弗勒盖索斯（Phlegethos）的恶魔法庭的冷静法官监督。",
	"For a mortal who hasn't yet signed away their soul, a sentence coming from the Diabolical Courts carries a terrifying prospect. However, a soulless mortal may wonder what more could come from a breach of contract. Quite a bit, actually. Devils are incredibly creative when·it comes to torture, and few things delight them as much as tormenting the guilty.": "对于一个还没有签下自己灵魂的凡人来说，来自恶魔法庭的判决是一个可怕的前景。然而，一个没有灵魂的凡人可能会想，违反合同还能带来什么。事实上，有很多。当涉及到酷刑时，魔鬼是非常有创造力的，很少有东西能像折磨有罪的人那样让他们高兴。",
	"When devils break infernal law, the punishment is more severe. Higher-ranking devils are capable of demoting those beneath them, forcing them to squirm and shuffle as larva-like lemures for a few centuries. In some instances, the offender's soul may be consumed, destroying it forever. The ultimate form of discipline for devils who break their contracts is an item granted to Asmodeus by Primus known as the Ruby Rod. There is no record of the punishment administered by Asmodeus through the Ruby Rod, but it is chilling to imagine a fate that frightens even the most ruthless of fiends.": "当魔鬼违反地狱法则时，惩罚会更加严厉。级别较高的魔鬼能够将他们下面的人降级，迫使他们在几个世纪内像幼虫一样蠕动和摇晃。在某些情况下，犯罪者的灵魂可能会被吞噬，永远毁灭。对违反契约的魔鬼的最终惩戒形式是普利姆斯授予阿斯莫德的一件物品，称为红宝石棒。没有关于阿斯莫德通过红宝石棒实施惩罚的记录，但想象一下让最冷酷无情的魔鬼也感到恐惧的命运，是令人不寒而栗的。",
	"I'm a little fuzzy on obligation. It boils down to this: You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. Really, really hard.": "我对义务有点模糊不清。归结起来就是这样。你给我挠背，我就给你挠背。真的，真的很努力。",
	"Read it twice. Give it another look, this time with a jeweler's loupe. Apply divination magic liberally, searching for hidden scripts or glyphs. Finally, crumple it up and walk away. vWiat on earth were you thinking?": "读它两遍。再看一遍，这次要用珠宝商的放大镜。大量运用占卜魔法，寻找隐藏的文字或字形。最后，把它揉成一团，走开。 你到底在想什么？",
	"The fine print is a classic and necessary component of an infernal contract, dating all the way back to the Pact Primeval. Devils recognize the inherent suspicion that accompanies their dealings. If anyone truly understood the ramifications of such agreements, no one would ever agree to sign an infernal contract. As a result, devils must entice others with wild temptations and shroud their unfavorable intentions behind inconspicuous details.": "细则是地狱契约的一个经典和必要的组成部分，可以一直追溯到原始契约。魔鬼们认识到伴随着他们交易的固有的怀疑。如果有人真正了解这种协议的后果，就不会有人同意签署一份无间道合同。因此，魔鬼必须用疯狂的诱惑来引诱他人，并将其不利的意图掩盖在不显眼的细节之后。",
	"A devil is never offended when a signee requests the entirety of the agreement in writing. In fact, it's often the first indication that the signee means serious business. There are hundreds of sour souls that wound up in the Nine Hells becuase they never saw the terms of agreement (especially the offer and consideration) spelled out in writing. Some devilish salesmen default to the written agreement. This provides a false sense of security to some signees, almost as if the devil is looking out for them.": "当收货人要求以书面形式提供协议的全部内容时，魔鬼是不会被冒犯的。事实上，这往往是签约者认真做事的第一个迹象。有数以百计的酸楚的灵魂在九层地狱里受伤，因为他们从来没有看到协议的条款（特别是报价和代价）以书面形式写出来。一些魔鬼般的推销员默认书面协议。这给一些签约者提供了一种虚假的安全感，几乎就像魔鬼在照顾他们一样。",
	"Dungeon Masters should root for their players as the protagonists of the narrative, celebrating success and good storytelling. Most adventurers are not gullible; while a player may gloss over certain aspects of an infernal contract, their character has been hardened by their journey.

While the latter may engage a player temporarily, the former can deepen a player's investment in the campaign.": "地下城管理员应该支持他们的玩家作为叙事的主角，庆祝成功和讲好故事。大多数冒险者并不容易受骗；虽然玩家可能会掩饰无间道契约的某些方面，但他们的性格已经在旅途中变得坚韧。通过强调这些协议是角色扮演的机会，而不是陷阱或谜题，你可能会取得更大的成功。虽然后者可能会暂时吸引玩家，但前者可以加深玩家对活动的投入。",
	"When you introduce an infernal contract to your table, you may wish to institute a series of ability checks to examine the document for any fine print. A challenge such as this is an excellent excuse for a character to show off their Proficiencies in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma-based ability checks. If the signee is lacking in these areas, it's a good opportunity to share the spotlight and emphasize teamwork. Below are a few skills and their suggested uses in discovering fine print when a character is examining an infernal contract. You can reference the Difficulty Class by Level table for guidance on setting appropriate DCs for these checks and choosing the type of devil to extend a contract.": "当你把一份无间道合同引入你的桌子时，你可能希望进行一系列的能力检查来检查文件中的任何细节。像这样的挑战是一个很好的借口，可以让角色展示他们在智力、智慧和魅力方面的能力检查。如果签约者在这些方面有所欠缺，这是一个分享焦点和强调团队合作的好机会。下面是一些技能和它们在发现细部的建议用途，当一个角色正在检查一个无间道合同时。你可以参考《按等级划分的难度等级表》，为这些检查设定适当的DC，并选择魔鬼的类型来延长合同。",

	"Locating fine print on a physical document can be an exhilarating experience for your players. Some may become paranoid upon seeing legal jargon or infernal embellishments, while others might meticulously review each phrase contained within the document. Fine print encourages participation from the entire party, whether it's through social interaction, ability checks, or marking up a physical document. The {@table Fine Print|DA:GIC} table presents examples of fine print that may be found in an infernal contract. Remember to be cautious when incorporating fine print into a physical document. There is a thin line between the satisfying \"Ah-ha!\" moment of locating fine print and frustrating or even antagonizing a player who feels as if, the expectations weren't clear. If your players don't locate a particular string of fine print, consider saving it for a future instance where the contract is dramatically reproduced for your players. Alternatively, you may choose to ignore it entirely in the interest of preserving the moment.": "在一份实物文件上找到细小的文字，对你的球员来说是一种令人振奋的经历。有些人在看到法律术语或无间道的修饰时可能会变得疑神疑鬼，而另一些人可能会仔细审查文件中的每一句话。细致的文字鼓励整个团队的参与，无论是通过社会互动、能力检查，还是在实体文件上做标记。{@table Fine Print|DA:GIC}表列出了可能出现在无间道合同中的细小文字的例子。记住，在将细小的文字纳入物理文件时要谨慎行事。在 \"啊哈！\"令人满意的找到细小文字的时刻和让玩家感到沮丧甚至对抗之间有一条细线，因为他们觉得期望并不明确。如果你的玩家没有找到某一串细小的文字，可以考虑把它留到将来为你的玩家大幅复制合同的时候使用。或者，你也可以选择完全忽略它，以保持当下的利益。",
	"No being has ever been forced to sign a contract of mine. Every signee has willingly agreed to abide by the terms therein, which I subsequently enforced with absolute precision.": "从来没有人被强迫签署我的合同。每个签约者都自愿同意遵守其中的条款，而我随后也绝对准确地执行了这些条款。",
	"No contract is complete without acceptance. Regardless of all the tantalizing offers and sinister tricks that a devil may use to entice the signee, it cannot force an agreement. Just like any mortal contract, both parties reserve the right to walk away if they are not satisfied enough to sign.": "没有接受的合同是不完整的。无论魔鬼用什么诱人的提议和阴险的伎俩来引诱收信人，它都不能强迫达成协议。就像任何凡人的合同一样，如果双方都不满意，可以保留离开的权利，以便签字。",
	"Not all contracts have signature lines. The drafter reserves the right to determine the method of the agreement once all is said and done, though this must be stated in the contract. For example, a succubus or incubus may seal their deals with a kiss rather than a pen and parchment. The {@table Devil Clinches|DA:GIC} table presents a few additional options to finalize your infernal contracts with hellish flavor.": "不是所有的合同都有签字线。起草者保留决定协议方式的权利，一旦所有的事情都完成了，尽管这必须在合同中说明。例如，魅魔或妖怪可能会用一个吻而不是用笔和羊皮纸来签署他们的交易。{@table Devil Clinches|DA:GIC}表提出了一些额外的选择，以最终确定你的具有地狱风味的无间道合同。",
	"Signing a contract takes no time whatsoever. In times of dire need, the deal occurs in the blink of an eye, regardless of the amount of time spent deliberating. That said, stalling is a common occurrence for both parties when the need for a contract is less-immediate. If this is not the signee's first infernal agreement, they must choose a higher service tier than their previous contract. While this confers an additional benefit, the cost of subsequent bargains weighs on the signee's soul - if they still have one.": "签署合同不需要任何时间。在迫切需要的时候，交易发生在眨眼之间，不管花了多少时间考虑。也就是说，当对合同的需求不那么迫切时，拖延是双方都会发生的。如果这不是受访者的第一份无间道协议，他们必须选择比之前合同更高的服务等级。虽然这赋予了一个额外的好处，但随后的讨价还价的代价却压在了受让人的灵魂上--如果他们还有灵魂的话。",
	"I'm old fashioned. It's gotta be blood. I don't care whose, but it's blood or no deal.": "我是老式的。它必须是血。我不在乎是谁的，但不流血就没有交易。",
	"The eyes of mortals tire easily. Clause or two at the end that complicates the agreement. Once you've worn them down, put a pen in their hand.": "凡人的眼睛容易疲劳。在结尾处有一两个使协议复杂化的条款。一旦你让他们疲惫不堪，就把笔放在他们手里。",
	"Many contracts contain supplementary clauses apart fromthe five standard components. Clever signees employ suchclauses to reign in dubious statements and other liabilities. Conversely, the drafter may include additional sections todisorient the signee further and ensure that the deal tips inthe devil's favor.": "除了五个标准部分之外，许多合同还包含补充条款。聪明的签约人利用这些条款来控制可疑的声明和其他责任。反之，起草者可能包括额外的条款，以进一步限制签名人，并确保交易对魔鬼有利。",
	"Pacts of the Nine Hells are ghastly personifications of their earthly counterparts. Similar to mortal arrangements, a breach occurs when either party fails to uphold their agreed-upon duties. Perhaps the signee's soul was somehow tainted at time of collection, or the offer provided by the fiend did not match the original description. The most common form of a contractual breach is attempting to avoid collection.": "九层地狱的契约是其尘世对应物的可怕化身。与凡人的安排类似，当任何一方未能坚持其约定的责任时，就会发生违约。也许在收集的时候，接受者的灵魂受到了某种程度的玷污，或者恶魔提供的报价与最初的描述不一致。最常见的合同违约形式是试图避免收款。",
	"Signees that clarify a supplementary clause should proceed with caution. If they have not given the contract a proper inspection before marking it up, the signee may weaken their position. Keeping the agreement vague may seem like a bad idea, but if a breach of contract becomes a case in the Diabolical Courts, leaving a clause open to interpretation could be your ticket to freedom.": "澄清补充条款的签字人应谨慎行事。如果他们在标记合同之前没有对其进行适当的检查，那么签署人可能会削弱他们的地位。保持协议的模糊性似乎是一个坏主意，但如果违约成为恶魔法庭的一个案例，留下一个可以解释的条款可能是你获得自由的门票。",
	"When one party fails to honor their obligation, the other party may be entitled to the additional property. Collateral is specified during the drafting process as a protection against risk. For example, the contract administrator states that the signee's soul must be of equal or greater purity as when the agreement was signed. They then stipulate that if this requirement is not met at the time of collection, it will result in the surrender of collateral, such the signee's land or family name.": "当一方未能履行其义务时，另一方可能有权获得额外的财产。在起草过程中规定了抵押品，作为对风险的一种保护。例如，合同管理人规定，受让人的灵魂必须与签署协议时的纯度相同或更高。然后他们规定，如果在收款时没有达到这一要求，将导致抵押品的交出，如收件人的土地或姓氏。",
	"Collateral can be in favor of either the contract administrator or the signee. One clever halfling by the name of Dren Thistle foot snuck in a clause stating that the true name of the contract administrator would be revealed in the event of a contractual breach. The administrator gladly signed, knowing that it would never violate infernal law. What the devil missed was that Thistlefoot tied this collateral to both parties - regardless of who was at fault for said breach. When Thistlefoot violated his agreement, he cheerfully spoke the devil's name and commanded it to nullify the entire agreement.": "抵押品可以有利于合同管理人或受让人。有一个聪明的半身人，名字叫德伦-蓟足，他偷偷加入了一个条款，说明在违反合同的情况下，合同管理人的真实姓名将被披露。管理者很高兴地签了字，因为他知道这绝不会违反地狱法。恶魔所忽略的是，蓟足将这一抵押品与双方捆绑在一起--无论谁对上述违约有过错。当Thistlefoot违反他的协议时，他愉快地说出了魔鬼的名字，并命令它使整个协议作废。",
	"Damages are the punitive consequences of breaching of contract. A common repercussion is to demand additional payment from the offending party. Because few contracts deal in dollars and cents, a signee who violates their agreement may find that their original consideration no longer suffices. One precious memory becomes two. Instead of taking your voice for an hour, the devil may take it forever, rendering you mute. In cases of soul contracts, the administrator could cut the signee's life short, collect any collateral to which the signee previously agreed, or convert them to a wretched lemure on the spot. Damages, unless explicitly outlined in the contract, are decided by Belial or another high-ranking fiend in the Diabolical Courts of Phlegethos. Punishment is carried out in the appropriate layer.": "损害赔偿是违反合同的惩罚性后果。一个常见的反作用力是要求违约方支付额外的费用。因为很少有合同是以美元和美分为单位的，所以违反协议的签约人可能会发现他们原来的代价已经不够了。一个宝贵的记忆变成了两个。魔鬼可能会在一小时内夺走你的声音，而不是永远夺走它，使你成为哑巴。在灵魂契约的情况下，管理人可以缩短收受人的生命，收集收受人先前同意的任何抵押品，或者当场将他们转化为可悲的勒姆人。除非合同中有明确规定，否则损害赔偿是由贝利亚或弗勒盖索斯的恶魔法庭中的其他高级恶魔决定的。惩罚是在适当的层面上进行的。",
	"A cancellation clause provides terms for nullification of the contract as a whole. Few reasons exist for a devil to include such an exit, but occasionally, these clauses do make it into the final contract. Because they are heavily in favor of the signee, cancellation clauses are airtight. An experienced drafter abolishes all traces of interpretation that could result in the signee dodging their agreement.": "取消条款为整个合同的无效提供了条件。很少有理由让一个魔鬼包括这样的退出，但偶尔，这些条款确实进入了最终合同。因为它们在很大程度上有利于签约人，所以取消条款是无懈可击的。一个有经验的起草人会废除所有可能导致受让人逃避协议的解释痕迹。",
	"Devils live in a constant state of uncertainty. A devil fears two things: rebellion from lower-ranking conspirators and retaliation from those above. Because of this, the drafter may indulge its suspicion and include a noncompete clause, stating that the signee cannot pursue overlapping agreements with other archdevils or mighty beings. For this reason, contract administrators are wary of extending contracts to warlocks, and any devil worth their weight in sulfur will ask to see the details of any existing pacts. Contrary to its mortal counterpart, infernal arbitration is anything but a dull affair. However, it is still a lengthy process, and the contract administrator would rather spend that time meeting its soul quotas.": "魔鬼一直生活在一种不确定的状态中。魔鬼害怕两件事：低级阴谋家的叛乱和上级的报复。正因为如此，起草者可能会放纵它的怀疑，并加入一个不竞争条款，说明签约者不能与其他大魔鬼或强大的生命追求重叠的协议。由于这个原因，合同管理人对与术士签订合同持谨慎态度，任何有价值的魔鬼都会要求查看任何现有契约的细节。与凡人的仲裁相反，地狱的仲裁并不是一件无聊的事情。然而，这仍然是一个漫长的过程，而契约管理员宁愿把时间花在满足其灵魂配额上。",
	"A devil may require the signee to keep certain details of the contract secret. A nondisclosure clause guards sensitive information against those who might interfere or otherwise annoy the devil who wrote it. Additionally, a devil may benefit from damaging a relationship between the signee and other celestials, fiends, or party members.": "魔鬼可能要求签约人对合同的某些细节保密。保密条款可以保护敏感信息，防止那些可能干扰或以其他方式惹恼写合同的魔鬼的人。此外，魔鬼可能会从破坏收信人与其他天人、魔鬼或党员之间的关系中获益。",
	"Running is foolish. Every second that you spend evading collection is borrowed time. It's better to face your fate than to risk your remaining sanity in one of those nightmarish bags they carry.": "逃跑是愚蠢的。你花在躲避收集上的每一秒都是借来的时间。与其在他们携带的那些噩梦般的袋子中冒险，不如面对自己的命运。",
	"It's no surprise that infernal contracts require enforcement. The law of devils is a complex network of statues - reinforced with centuries of precedent. However, infernal law is not always just, and the days leading up to collection - the time when the fiend confiscates the signee's consideration - are bleak and hopeless. It is sporadic for a signee to be so accepting of their fate as to render payment to a devil willingly. Such signees represent dutiful mortals who entered such bargains out of necessity, such as fallen paladins and former soldiers. Because of the fear surrounding the merciless punishments administered in the Hells, most signees are dragged down kicking and screaming.": "无间道合同需要执行，这并不奇怪。魔鬼的法律是一个复杂的法规网络--通过几个世纪的先例得到加强。然而，无间道的法律并不总是公正的，在收钱之前的日子里--也就是恶魔没收收件人的代价的时候--是暗淡无光的。签收人如此接受自己的命运，心甘情愿地向魔鬼付款的情况时有发生。这样的签名者代表着尽职尽责的凡人，他们出于需要而达成这样的交易，如堕落的圣骑士和前士兵。由于对地狱中无情的惩罚的恐惧，大多数签约者都是被踢着拖下去的。",
	"It's common for a signee to struggle or attempt an escape when their time runs out. The majority of signees don't pose a threat to any devil capable of extending a contract, but occasionally one will require assistance in collecting what is owed to them. The signee may have been granted an item that's dangerous to the contract administrator, or perhaps their hard-earned prowess in magic allows them to hide for years on end. A signee that presents a significant risk of delay will find that the Nine Hells doesn't take retaliation lightly come collection time.": "签约者在时间耗尽时挣扎或试图逃跑是很常见的。大多数签约者不会对任何有能力延长合同的魔鬼构成威胁，但偶尔会有一个人需要帮助来收取欠他们的钱。签约者可能被授予了一件对合同管理人来说很危险的物品，或者也许他们辛辛苦苦获得的魔法能力使他们可以连续多年隐藏起来。一个有重大拖延风险的收货人将发现，在收货时间到来时，九层地狱不会轻易进行报复。",
	"Collection efforts are performed on behalf of the contract administrator. They are reimbursed by either the contract administrator or a higher-ranking devil to which the contract administrator reports, such as a duke or archdevil. These barbarous task forces may involve any number of devils outlined in the {@i Monster Manual} or {@i Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes}, but most collection efforts include {@creature bagger|DA:GIC|baggers}, {@creature bloodhound|DA:GIC|bloodhounds}, and {@creature handler|DA:GIC|handlers} (see Appendix A for monster stats). Regardless of the type of devils that compose the group, these enforcers are commonly referred to as collection agents.": "收集工作是代表合同管理员进行的。他们由合同管理人或合同管理人的上级魔鬼（如公爵或大魔鬼）报销。这些野蛮的工作队可能涉及{@i Monster Manual}或{@i Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes}中列出的任何数量的魔鬼，但大多数收集工作包括{@creature bagger|DA:GIC|baggers}、{@creature bloodhound|DA:GIC|bloodhounds}和{@creature handler|DA:GIC|handlers}（怪物统计资料见附录A）。无论组成团体的魔鬼类型如何，这些执行者通常被称为收集人员。",
	"Hellhounds are excellent trackers, but they're mediocre at sniffing out signees who can mask their trail with illusion magic or hide through a spell like {@spell Mordenkainen's private sanctum}. Deep in the lorehouses of frigid Cania, servants of the archdevil Mephistopheles sought to remedy this problem by experimenting on hellhounds with ancient magic. The result was the bloodhound, a brutish tracker with a nose calibrated to arcane violators. When it's in range, the olfactory glands of a bloodhound's snout are capable of disrupting magical nondetection and illusions": "地狱犬是优秀的追踪者，但它们在嗅出那些能用幻觉魔法掩盖其踪迹或通过{@spell Mordenkainen's private sanctum}这样的咒语隐藏起来的人方面表现平平。在寒冷的卡尼亚的理论室深处，大恶魔梅菲斯特的仆人们试图用古老的魔法在地狱犬身上做实验来补救这个问题。结果是血猎犬，一种野蛮的追踪者，它的鼻子被校准为奥术违反者。当它在范围内时，猎血犬鼻子的嗅觉腺能够破坏魔法的非检测和幻觉。",
	"Escaping the consequences of an infernal contract may seem futile, but it is not impossible. While the vast majority of attempts to circumvent infernal law have resulted in the signee being bagged, beaten, and taken to the Hells by a collection agent, occasionally a signee has successfully terminated their contract. This has happened more times than devils would like to admit (even as a sales tactic). A few methods of escaping judgment exist, though they have only been successful in rare instances through the efforts of brilliant individuals.": "逃避无间道合同的后果似乎是徒劳的，但也并非不可能。虽然绝大多数试图规避无间道法律的行为都导致签约人被装袋、殴打，并被收账员带往地狱，但偶尔也有签约人成功终止他们的合同。这种情况比魔鬼们愿意承认的要多得多（甚至作为一种销售策略）。存在一些逃避判决的方法，尽管它们只是在极少数情况下通过聪明人的努力获得成功。",
	"Beggars are the worst. Those guys got no respect for personal space.": "乞丐是最糟糕的。这些人不尊重个人空间。",
	"The most common approach is stalling by fight or flight. Pit fiends and even archdevils have better things to do than ensure every single soul is successfully obtained at the first collection attempt. Mephistopheles is not surprised when he hears that the bright, young apprentice that signed 7 0 years ago has become a master of the arcane arts with powerful friends. He cannot risk an uprising from the seven layers above him by sending swaths of pit fiends to the gates of an epic stronghold. The ruler of Cania is content to let his collection agents respawn in his icy fortress and send them on additional attempts in greater numbers, gathering information with each failure. Even masters make mistakes eventually.": "最常见的方法是通过战斗或逃跑来拖延时间。坑道魔王甚至大恶魔都有更好的事情要做，而不是确保每一个灵魂都能在第一次收集尝试中成功获得。当梅菲斯特听说7 0年前签约的那个聪明的年轻学徒已经成为拥有强大朋友的奥术大师时，他并不感到惊讶。他不能冒着上面七层人起义的风险，把成片的坑道恶魔送到一个史诗般的据点门口。卡尼亚的统治者满足于让他的收集人员在他的冰雪堡垒中重生，并派他们以更大的数量进行额外的尝试，在每次失败中收集信息。即使是大师，最终也会犯错。",
	"The only way to permanently avoid collection is to terminate the contract. Grounds for termination can be established before the contract is signed through a cancellation clause or loophole, but mortals who escape their contracts usually do so after sealing the deal": "永久避免收款的唯一方法是终止合同。终止合同的理由可以在合同签署前通过取消条款或漏洞来确定，但逃避合同的凡人通常是在签订交易后才这样做的。",
	"To less-experienced adventurers, combat is not an option. Fighting off collection agents is hard enough; making a noticeable dent in a benefactor's forces is an impossible task. However, this is another story for a party composed of archmages and martial paragons. These parties are capable of planar travel and can cause permanent gaps in a benefactor's forces by killing devils permanently on their native plane. With the Blood War's drain on resources and the constant threat of usurpation, the administrator may renege on the contract altogether.": "对于经验不足的冒险者来说，战斗不是一种选择。打击收账员已经够难的了；要想在恩人的势力中取得明显的突破是不可能的任务。然而，对于由大法师和武学典范组成的队伍来说，这就是另一回事了。这些队伍有能力进行平面旅行，并且可以通过在魔鬼的本位面永久地杀死他们，从而使施主的力量出现永久性的缺口。随着血战对资源的消耗和篡夺的不断威胁，管理人可能会完全背弃合同。",
	"It's hard to enforce something that doesn't exist. Devils take many precautions to protect their contracts by making copious duplicates, protecting the original with wards and glyphs, and hiding documents in the most remote and secure locations across the Nine Hells. Although, if a signee is confident that they have eviscerated all traces of the agreement, they can invoke {@i corpus scripturam} (\"body of writing\"), an infernal right which states proof of contract must be presented at the time of collection. However, the signee may be surprised to find that they missed a copy.": "要执行不存在的东西是很难的。魔鬼们采取了许多预防措施来保护他们的合同，包括制作大量的副本，用魔法和石刻保护原件，并将文件藏在整个九层地狱最偏远和安全的地方。虽然，如果签约者确信他们已经清除了协议的所有痕迹，他们可以援引{@i corpus scripturam}（\"书写体\"），这是一项地狱权利，规定在收取时必须出示合同的证明。然而，签字人可能会惊讶地发现，他们错过了一份副本。",
	"You know what they say. Fool me once, and I'll take your firstborn.": "你知道他们说什么。骗我一次，我就把你的长子带走。",
	"The sooner that a signee plans for termination, the higher their success rate. Mortal history is brimming with examples of educated nobles underestimating the common folk. Devils are no different in their perspective on inexperienced adventurers. If a signee can successfully feign ignorance, they may be able to slip in an exit plan when making alterations the document. A creative wizard may apply qualifiers to the contract's jurisdiction, only to live out the last few years of her life on another plane. A bard might spot the devil's fine print and pretend not to notice, only to twist it against the devil later in a cancellation clause.": "签约者越早计划终止，他们的成功率就越高。凡间的历史充满了受过教育的贵族低估普通人的例子。魔鬼们对没有经验的冒险家的看法也不例外。如果签名人能够成功地假装无知，他们可能会在修改文件时加入一个退出计划。一个有创造力的巫师可能会在合同的管辖范围内加上限定词，然后在另一个位面度过她生命中的最后几年。吟游诗人可能会发现魔鬼的细枝末节，并假装没有注意到，只是在以后的取消条款中扭曲它来对付魔鬼。",
	"A signee may be able to renegotiate the terms of their agreement in favor of something else. Substitutions are contractual amendments that must always be negotiated before the final collection. By displaying desperation to keep said consideration, a signee makes the first deal more alluring. Therefore, the contract administrator won't permit a substitution unless the deal is particularly favorable and outweighs the signee's original consideration. Historical substitutions include persuading influential mortals (usually nobility) on behalf of the devil, improving the standing of a diabolical cult, or delivering a significant blow to one of the contract administrator's rivals. Finally, a substitution may result in confiscation of the original offer.": "受让人可能会重新谈判协议条款，而选择其他东西。替代条款是合同修正案，必须始终在最后收款前进行谈判。通过表现出对保留上述对价的绝望，受让人使第一笔交易更加诱人。因此，合同管理人不会允许替代，除非该交易特别有利，并且超过了受让人的原始对价。历史上的替代包括代表魔鬼说服有影响力的凡人（通常是贵族），提高一个邪恶邪教的地位，或给合同管理人的一个对手以重大打击。最后，替代可能会导致原始报价被没收。",
	"It takes two parties to form a contract. While the DM creates and presents these hellish agreements, it is the player's job to interact with them. Adventurers propose or agree on the consideration. They negotiate with the contract administrator for an appropriate offer, examine the fine print, and make physical alterations to the document when they•discover questionable statements. Ultimately, the player and their character can choose to refuse the contract in its entirety.": "需要两方才能形成一个合同。虽然DM创造并提出了这些地狱般的协议，但玩家的工作是与它们互动。冒险者提出或同意对价。他们与合同管理人谈判，以获得适当的报价，检查细节，并在发现有问题的陈述时对文件进行实际修改。最终，玩家和他们的角色可以选择拒绝合同的全部内容。",
	"Myazda glanced at the symbol emblazoned on her shield. Dealing with this wicked fiend could save hundreds of dwarves. Was she afraid that she'd no longer be worthy to serve her god, or was it the dark hunger in the devil's eyes as she contemplated the pact?": "迈阿兹达瞥了一眼印在她盾牌上的符号。与这个邪恶的魔鬼打交道可以拯救数百个矮人。她是害怕自己不再有资格为她的神服务，还是在她考虑这个契约时，魔鬼眼中的黑暗饥渴？",
	"Character alignment has become a hotly-contested subject in recent years. Some players use it as justification to perform an act that might upset the other players, such as stealing from a party member. Someone playing a Lawful Good paladin may treat alignment as a way to keep the party to alignment when a decision would have a considerable impact on their character's arc or the campaign. For a great reference on how a character of a particular alignment might act, I recommend easydamus.com.": "近几年来，角色排列成为一个争论激烈的话题。一些玩家用它作为执行可能会使其他玩家不高兴的行为的理由，例如偷窃党员的东西。扮演合法善的圣骑士的人可能会把对准作为一种方式，当一个决定会对他们角色的弧线或战役产生相当大的影响时，让党员保持对准。如果想了解某个特定对准的角色会如何行动，我推荐easydamus.com。",
	"No matter how you see them, alignments - along with bonds, ideals, and flaws - serve as a reference to how your character may act in a given circumstance. However, no character acts in accordance with their alignment one hundred percent of the time. Due to the limitless nature of the offer, infernal contracts can pose moral quandaries to all characters.": "无论你如何看待它们，结盟--连同纽带、理想和缺陷--都是你的角色在特定情况下如何行动的参考。然而，没有哪个角色在百分之百的时间里是按照他们的排列组合行事的。由于提议的无限性，无间道契约会给所有角色带来道德上的窘境。",
	"Paladins are the worst. Talk about a tough crowd! So holier than thou.": "圣骑士是最糟糕的。谈论一个强硬的人群! 比你更神圣。",
	"Good characters enter into infernal contracts for the greater good. Although infernal law is inherently evil, a character may sign if the offer facilitates an honorable pursuit, such as the whereabouts of a holy weapon. Good characters make sacrifices all the time in the interest of protecting innocent lives, but it doesn't stop the deal from leaving an unpleasant taste in their mouth.": "好的角色会为了更大的利益签订无间道合同。虽然无间道的法律本质上是邪恶的，但如果这个提议有利于一个光荣的追求，比如一个神圣武器的下落，那么一个角色就可以签署。为了保护无辜的生命，好的角色总是做出牺牲，但这并不能阻止交易在他们口中留下不愉快的味道。",
	"Evil characters, on the other hand, have no qualms signing on the dotted line. Having little sympathy for others, they are more inclined when a deal doesn't impact their wellbeing. In the end, these adventurers would rather save their soul for a god aligned with their interests.": "另一方面，邪恶的角色会毫无顾忌地在虚线上签字。由于对他人没有什么同情心，当交易不影响他们的利益时，他们会更倾向于这样做。最后，这些冒险家宁愿把自己的灵魂留给与他们利益一致的神。",
	"Lawful characters don't immediately conform to every law. In fact, it's impossible. No two nations or even neighboring kingdoms share every law. To these characters, \"law\" represents a personal code, such as always respecting a just monarch or never killing a creature that surrenders.": "合法的角色不会立即遵守每一条法律。事实上，这是不可能的。没有两个国家甚至相邻的王国共享每一条法律。对这些人物来说，\"法律 \"代表了一种个人准则，比如永远尊重公正的君主，或者永远不杀投降的生物。",
	"Chaotic characters are uncomfortable with rigid contractual obligations. A sizeable amount of collection efforts are targeted at these individuals. Chaotic characters dance to their tune, and they will sign if it's in their best interests - or at least if it appears so.": "混乱的人物对严格的合同义务感到不舒服。大量的收款工作都是针对这些人的。混沌性格的人跟着他们的调子跳舞，如果符合他们的最大利益，或者至少看起来是这样，他们就会签字。",
	"While paladins have no qualms being beholden to a code, infernal law is inherently evil and almost certainly against the tenets by which they live. The same goes for clerics devoted to a good god, such as Ilmater or Lathander. Signing a deal with a devil could result in broken oaths or losing the divine magic granted to the character by their god. However, a lawful good character - and possibly their deity- may justify an infernal bargain if it can subvert an unavoidable disaster, save the lives of innocent creatures, or restore balance to the cosmos.": "虽然圣骑士对遵守法典毫无顾虑，但地狱法本质上是邪恶的，几乎可以肯定是违背了他们的生活信条。献身于善神的神职人员也是如此，比如伊尔马特或拉坦德。与魔鬼签订协议可能会导致违背誓言或失去他们的神赋予角色的神圣魔法。然而，一个合法的好角色--可能还有他们的神明--可能会证明一个地狱交易是合理的，如果它能颠覆一个不可避免的灾难，拯救无辜生物的生命，或者恢复宇宙的平衡。",
