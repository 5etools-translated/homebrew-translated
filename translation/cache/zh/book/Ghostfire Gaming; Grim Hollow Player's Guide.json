	"Welcome to Grim Hollow!, Or welcome back, if you were one of the backers or players who helped make our first book, {@i Grim Hollow, The Campaign Guide}, a success. If you've read the {@i Campaign Guide}, you know what Grim Hollow is all about. ıf you haven't lock your doors and draw your shutters. Gather 'round the campfire, but keep na eye on the underbush. It's full moon tonight!": "欢迎来到Grim Hollow！，或者说欢迎回来，如果你是帮助我们的第一本书{@i Grim Hollow, The Campaign Guide}取得成功的支持者或玩家之一。如果你读过{@i Campaign Guide}，你就知道严峻空洞是怎么回事了。如果你没有，请锁上你的门，拉上你的百叶窗。聚集在篝火旁，但要注意草丛下的情况。今晚是满月!",
	"Dark fantasy and horror have long been a favorite genre of storytellers—not to mention story listeners. From the earliest humans gathered around fires, making up stories of the monsters that inhabited the dark, the wilderness, the seas, and the spaces between the stars, we've never lost the thrill of being thrilled, the adrenaline rush of being scared out of our wits, while knowing—or at least hoping—that we're safe from any true danger.": "黑暗幻想和恐怖长期以来一直是讲故事的人最喜欢的类型，更不用说听故事的人了。从最早的人类围着火堆，编造居住在黑暗、荒野、海洋和星空之间的怪物的故事开始，我们就从未失去过被惊吓的快感，被吓得魂飞魄散的肾上腺素，同时知道--或者至少希望--我们是安全的，没有任何真正的危险。",
	"Grim Hollow and its world of Etharis offer roleplaying game fans the ability to partake in those thrills of a dark fantasy setting. Whether the terror comes in the form of nature's most reddened teeth and claws, or the fear spread through mortals' actions when they're driven by the lust for power, or the horror of lifeless monsters shambling through the moonless nights longing to extinguish the bright lights of life, Etharis teems with threats perfect for many different styles of horror-based, dark-fantasy campaigns.": "Grim Hollow和它的Etharis世界为角色扮演游戏爱好者提供了参与那些黑暗幻想背景下的惊险刺激的能力。无论恐怖是以自然界最红的牙齿和爪子的形式出现，还是通过凡人在权力欲望驱使下的行为所散发出的恐惧，或者是无生命的怪物在无月的夜晚晃动，渴望熄灭生命的亮光的恐怖，伊萨里斯都充满了威胁，非常适合许多不同风格的基于恐怖的黑暗幻想活动。",
	"More importantly, the rules in this book provide the means to allow players to experiment with their characters, who face the most terrible fate of all: succumbing to the darkness and being changed by it. The existential terror of becoming a monster can make fighting monsters seem pale by comparison.": "更重要的是，本书的规则提供了允许玩家对他们的角色进行实验的手段，他们面临着最可怕的命运：屈服于黑暗并被它改变。成为怪物的生存恐怖可以使与怪物战斗显得苍白无力。",
	"We thank the 9,138 backers who supported us in creating {@i Grim Hollow: The Players Guide}. Your overwhelming trust gave us the means and the motivation to make this book everything it could be. We hope you find in this book, whether you're a player or a GM, the ideas and the rules to create a campaign that captures deeply the feel of people staring into the darkness, hoping to survive but dreading what might come out of it—or out of themselves.": "我们感谢支持我们创作的9138名支持者（%0%）。你们压倒性的信任给了我们手段和动力，使这本书成为它可以成为的一切。我们希望你能在本书中发现，无论你是玩家还是GM，都能找到创造一个活动的想法和规则，深深地捕捉到人们凝视黑暗的感觉，希望能生存下来，但又害怕会有什么结果--或者是自己的结果。",
	"Classic tabletop roleplaying games often see the adventurers striding boldly across the countryside, tracking evil to its lair and vanquishing it in the name of wealth and glory, protecting the world and its people for another day.": "经典的桌面角色扮演游戏经常看到冒险家们勇敢地在乡间漫步，追踪邪恶的巢穴，并以财富和荣耀的名义将其消灭，保护世界和人民，以待后世。",
	"Dark fantasy tells a different story, and the world of Grim Hollow invites participants to imagine narratives tinged with shadow, fear, and the drama of despair.": "黑暗幻想讲述了一个不同的故事，《狰狞山谷》的世界邀请参与者想象带有阴影、恐惧和绝望的戏剧性的叙述。",
	"In the world of Etharis, the roles are reversed from a typical high-fantasy campaign. It is the good who cower in their fragile bastions of civilization while evil stalks freely across the land. Adventurers skulk furtively through the shadows, always aware of the danger that follows closely behind them—or the danger lurking within their bodies and souls. Welcome to Grim Hollow!": "在Etharis的世界里，角色与典型的高度幻想活动是相反的。善良的人蜷缩在他们脆弱的文明堡垒中，而邪恶的人则在这片土地上自由地游荡。冒险家们鬼鬼祟祟地在阴影中潜行，总是意识到紧跟在他们身后的危险，或者潜伏在他们身体和灵魂中的危险。欢迎来到灰暗谷地!",
	"Etharis is a world on the brink of total destruction. The gods are dead, coldfire threatens to consume the world, the City Below stands poised to flood the world with unearthly dangers... any one of a hundred events could be the spark that sets the world aflame.": "Etharis是一个处于完全毁灭边缘的世界。诸神已死，冷火威胁着要吞噬世界，地下之城准备用超凡的危险淹没世界......一百个事件中的任何一个都可能成为点燃世界的火种。",
	"In such a world, how can heroes exist? What does victory even look like? Players in such a setting should take these factors into consideration when tackling character creation and during gameplay itself.": "在这样一个世界里，英雄怎么可能存在？胜利到底是什么样子的？在这样的环境中，玩家在处理角色创建和游戏本身时应该考虑到这些因素。",
	"Character backstories in fantasy rarely revolve around happy and mundane events. In dark fantasy, those backstories are generally even more dark and dramatic.": "奇幻小说中的人物背景故事很少围绕着快乐和平凡的事件展开。在黑暗幻想中，这些背景故事通常更加黑暗和戏剧化。",
	"What motivates and shapes dark fantasy protagonists? The loss of a loved one. Betrayal by those closest to them. Disastrous events that the character felt powerless to stop. Inscrutable and irrepressible powers reaching out and molding the lives and personalities of the characters with a cold and malevolent disregard.": "是什么激励和塑造了黑暗幻想的主角？失去所爱的人。被最亲近的人背叛。人物感到无力阻止的灾难性事件。不可侵犯和不可抗拒的力量伸出手来，以冷酷和恶毒的态度塑造人物的生活和个性。",
	"The world of Etharis is defined by these horrible events, and it stands to reason that the characters within it follow suit. How would these circumstances and events lead to a life as an adventurer, braving the dangers that most flee from in terror? Did your character become bitter and cynical, only looking out for their own interests? Did they rally and push back against despair, resolving to fight for the last glimmers of light that remain? What is your character fighting for?": "Etharis的世界是由这些可怕的事件所定义的，因此，其中的人物也理应如此。这些环境和事件会如何导致一个冒险家的生活，勇敢面对大多数人在恐惧中逃离的危险？你的角色是否变得愤世嫉俗，只为自己的利益着想？他们是否团结起来，反击绝望，决心为剩下的最后一丝光亮而战？你的角色在为什么而战？",
	"These themes also work their way into the game itself. With the world in ruins, various elements of normal roleplaying get turned on their heads. Safety becomes a relative term, so spells such as {@spell alarm} or {@spell arcane lock} might be more useful than in traditional high fantasy settings. The monsters that stalk the wilds have successfully taken down entire civilizations, making it important to carefully pick your battles. Maybe not every battle or encounter is worth the cost of risking the entire war against darkness.": "这些主题也在游戏本身中发挥作用。随着世界变成废墟，正常的角色扮演的各种元素都被颠覆了。安全变成了一个相对的术语，所以像（%0%）或（%1%）这样的法术可能比在传统的高度幻想环境中更有用。在荒野中游荡的怪物已经成功地摧毁了整个文明，这使得仔细挑选你的战斗变得很重要。也许并不是每一场战斗或遭遇都值得冒着风险与黑暗进行整个战争的代价。",
	"Demons walk the land of Etharis, twisting mortal fates to their whim. Misshapen abominations skulk in the shadows, waiting for their opportunity to strike. Darkness seeps from every corner and every crack in the world's façade, whispering promises of great power to those willing to answer... and to sacrifice. One enduring truth defines the tenebrous forces at play in Etharis: there is always a price for the aid of dark powers.": "恶魔在伊萨里斯的土地上行走，按照他们的意愿扭曲凡人的命运。畸形的憎恶潜伏在阴影中，伺机而动。黑暗从世界的每一个角落和每一条裂缝中渗出，对那些愿意回应......和愿意牺牲的人低声许诺着巨大的力量。一个永恒的真理决定了在伊萨里斯发生作用的十恶不赦的力量：黑暗力量的援助总是有代价的。",
	"Part of making a character in Grim Hollow is acknowledging the power of the forces of darkness. This setting offers a number of options for incorporating those powers into your character. Rather than merely picking up a Transformation Boon or the use of sangromancy like you would with an additional skill proficiency, these options work best when tied to specific character events. Perhaps you gladly accept these powers as a means to exact the revenge that your character seeks, or maybe it was an unwilling accident on the night of a full moon. Does your character regret these events or choices? Or do they fully embrace the power they have gained?": "在狰狞山谷中塑造角色的一部分是承认黑暗力量的力量。这个设定提供了许多将这些力量融入你的角色的选择。与其说你只是拿起了一个变身布恩，或者像使用额外的技能熟练度那样使用巫术，这些选择在与特定的角色事件相联系时效果最好。也许你欣然接受了这些力量，以此来实现你的角色所寻求的复仇，或者是在月圆之夜发生的一次不情愿的意外。你的角色是否对这些事件或选择感到后悔？或者他们完全接受他们所获得的力量？",
	"Once taken, these abilities are notoriously difficult to handle. When dealing with other humanoids, revealing your true nature can cause serious problems. As your power grows, its nature becomes harder and harder to conceal and control, and therefore harder to avoid the ramifications of your choice. It might be worth investing in {@item disguise kit|phb} proficiency or abilities such as {@spell disguise self} in order to better blend in among normal people.": "一旦获得这些能力，这些能力是出了名的难以处理。当与其他人类打交道时，暴露出你的真实本性会导致严重的问题。随着你的能力的增长，它的本质变得越来越难以掩盖和控制，因此也更难避免你的选择所带来的后果。也许值得投资于（%0%）的熟练度或能力，如（%1%），以便更好地融入正常人之中。",
	"Alas, even that might not be sufficient if circumstances force you to use your powers around others. Be warned. When you become as feared as the dark forces you oppose, natural agencies, like the business end of a farmer's pitchfork, can be just as dangerous as supernatural ones.": "唉，如果情况迫使你在别人身边使用你的力量，即使这样也可能不够。请注意。当你变得和你所反对的黑暗势力一样令人畏惧时，自然机构，如农民的干草叉的末端，可以和超自然的机构一样危险。",
	"Quite possibly the greatest cataclysm to strike Etharis was the disappearance of the gods. Few people know the truth of their downfall, with the exception of the human pantheon, but all are aware that praying to the gods brings no aid and no relief. The divine magic that always offered healing and protection to those in need vanished, and now few remain who can remember that golden age.": "袭击Etharis的最大灾难可能是众神的消失。除了人类万神殿之外，很少有人知道他们堕落的真相，但所有人都知道，向众神祈祷不会带来任何援助和救济。始终为有需要的人提供治疗和保护的神圣魔法消失了，现在很少有人还能记得那个黄金时代。",
	"As a player, the extreme scarcity of divine magic offers certain challenges to those wishing to play a cleric or paladin. Your very existence is a notable event, and you should discuss with your GM how you retain your magic and what effect that is likely to have on the world as a whole. The requirements for multiclassing are even steeper, and should be worked into the story as a major plot point.": "作为一个玩家，神圣魔法的极度匮乏为那些希望扮演牧师或圣骑士的玩家提供了某些挑战。你的存在是一个值得注意的事件，你应该与你的GM讨论你如何保留你的魔法，以及这可能对整个世界产生什么影响。对多类的要求更加严格，应该把它作为一个主要情节点纳入故事。",
	"The death of the gods has serious consequences, even for those who don't wish to partake in a divine class. Clerics, paladins, and religious organizations in general are often the main source of healing and curative magic in a roleplaying game, so their absence offers a major challenge. Diseases, curses, and other conditions are far more serious when you can't just stroll into the nearest temple and donate a hefty gold fee to cure them.": "诸神的死亡会带来严重的后果，即使对于那些不想参加神级的人来说也是如此。牧师、圣骑士和一般的宗教组织往往是角色扮演游戏中治疗和治愈魔法的主要来源，所以他们的缺席提供了一个重大挑战。当你不能随便走进最近的寺庙，捐献一笔巨额的金币来治疗疾病、诅咒和其他状况时，情况就会严重得多。",
	"Similarly, resurrection is a near impossibility. Players should be aware that lives are all the more precious in Etharis. Even the more mundane services offered by clergy, such as giving blessings and selling holy water, are rare. The helpful items for fighting the legions of darkness are valued greatly, and their value becomes even greater, meaning they should be seen and used sparingly.": "同样，复活也是几乎不可能的。玩家应该意识到，在伊萨里斯，生命更加珍贵。即使是神职人员提供的更平凡的服务，如给予祝福和出售圣水，也是罕见的。对抗黑暗军团的有用物品被高度重视，其价值变得更大，这意味着应该少见和少用。",
	"With the disappearance of divine magic, arcane spellcasters on Etharis found themselves the target of hatred and mistrust. A magic inquisition started in the Castinellan Provinces, bureaucracies sprang up to regulate and control mages elsewhere, and mobs hunted down those the common folk blamed for the gods' absence. Where once they delved into the mysteries of the universe, now wizards and their kin must seek to ensure their very survival.": "随着神圣魔法的消失，Etharis的奥术施法者发现自己成了仇恨和不信任的目标。卡斯蒂内兰省开始了魔法裁判所，其他地方也出现了规范和控制法师的官僚机构，暴民们追捕那些被普通人指责为神明缺席的人。曾经他们深入研究宇宙的奥秘，现在巫师和他们的亲属必须寻求确保他们的生存。",
	"As a player making an arcane spellcaster, whether a wizard, sorcerer, or warlock, you face a superstitious and hostile populace. Many of the regions in Etharis have instituted licensing schemes in order to regulate magic, so a valid license is an important piece of equipment for those seeking to practice magic legitimately. Wizards are the primary licensed spellcasters, while warlocks are almost never part of a magical organization or academy. With their innate abilities, sorcerers fall between the two, with as many fugitives as licensed practitioners.": "作为一个制作奥术法术师的玩家，无论是巫师、巫师还是术士，你都要面对一个迷信和敌对的民众。在Etharis的许多地区都制定了许可证制度以规范魔法，所以对于那些寻求合法的魔法实践的人来说，有效的许可证是一件重要的装备。巫师是主要的持牌施法者，而术士几乎从不属于魔法组织或学院。巫师凭借其与生俱来的能力，介于两者之间，其逃亡者与持证从业者一样多。",
	"Decide which category your character falls in, and work with your GM to determine any restrictions that may apply to your spellcasting license. Even licensed spellcasters are not wholly exempt from the resentment of the common folk, so brandishing a wand and spellbook in the middle of a crowded tavern may not be the wisest decision.": "决定你的角色属于哪一类，并与你的GM一起确定可能适用于你的施法许可的任何限制。即使是有执照的施法者也不能完全免于普通人的怨恨，所以在拥挤的酒馆中挥舞魔杖和魔法书可能不是最明智的决定。",
	"If you're not playing a spellcaster, you should consider how you feel about magic as a character. Did you grow up in the Castinellan Provinces, under the stern gaze of the Watchers of the Faithful? Or were you from the Nordlands, where magic is as much a fabric of everyday life as the forests and rivers? Regardless of how you feel about arcane magic at the start of your adventuring career, you should also consider how that opinion changes over time. Was your mistrust of arcane magic foolish as you now see it wielded by good and noble casters? Or do your personal interactions with arcane casters teach you that the fear of the arcane that you wrote off as superstition was instead a wise and prudent choice?": "如果你不是在扮演一个施法者，你应该考虑你作为一个角色对魔法的感受。你是在卡斯蒂内兰省，在忠实守望者的严厉注视下长大的？或者你来自北地，在那里，魔法就像森林和河流一样是日常生活的一部分？无论你在冒险生涯开始时对奥术魔法的看法如何，你也应该考虑这种看法是如何随时间变化的。你对奥术魔法的不信任是愚蠢的，因为你现在看到它被善良和高贵的施法者所挥舞？或者说，你与奥术施法者的个人互动告诉你，你把对奥术的恐惧写成迷信，反而是一个明智和谨慎的选择？",
	"Adventurers in roleplaying games are travelers. It's an integral part of the job and of the game as a whole. Normally travel occurs along a well-maintained and patrolled system of roads, with occasional forays into the natural wilderness in search of some vile creature upsetting the normal order of the world.": "角色扮演游戏中的冒险者是旅行者。这是工作的一个组成部分，也是整个游戏的一个组成部分。通常情况下，旅行是沿着一个维护良好、有巡逻的道路系统进行的，偶尔也会进入自然界的荒野，寻找一些扰乱世界正常秩序的卑劣生物。",
	"In a dark fantasy setting, messengers and patrols cannot be relied upon, and anyone who goes outside the safety of the town walls takes their life in their hands. Nighttime is especially dangerous, for any light serves as a beacon to the creatures waiting in the inky darkness. Travel in Etharis is not for the faint of heart, and may prove challenges equal to any story's climax.": "在一个黑暗的幻想环境中，不能依靠信使和巡逻队，任何走出镇墙安全范围的人都会把自己的生命掌握在自己手中。夜晚尤其危险，因为任何光线都会成为等待在墨色黑暗中的生物的信标。在Etharis的旅行不适合胆小的人，可能会被证明是相当于任何故事的高潮的挑战。",
	"As a character braving the wilds of Etharis, the first thing to learn is that there is no such thing as a safe campsite. When night falls, everything becomes fair game, so it's best to be prepared. Setting watches alone may not be sufficient, and you should always have a plan for awakening your allies to deal with the inevitable complications. Spells can aid in this regard, whether it's {@spell alarm}, {@spell magic mouth}, or any of the various sonic spells that can be heard hundreds of feet away. Darkvision can be especially useful for those standing watch, to avoid advertising your presence with a torch or campfire. But even then, darkvision is not perfect, and its limits can give certain threats an upper hand. Warding and protection spells, such as {@spell leomund's tiny hut|PHB|tiny hut} or {@spell rope trick}, are valuable in surviving long treks across dangerous territory.": "作为一个在Etharis荒野中冒险的人物，首先要了解的是，没有所谓的安全宿营地。当夜幕降临时，一切都会成为公平的游戏，所以最好做好准备。单独设岗可能是不够的，你应该始终有一个计划来唤醒你的盟友，以处理不可避免的复杂情况。法术可以在这方面提供帮助，无论是{@spell alarm}、{@spell magic mouth}，还是任何可以在数百英尺外听到的各种声波法术。暗视对站岗的人来说特别有用，可以避免用火把或篝火来宣传你的存在。但即使如此，暗视也不是完美的，它的局限性会让某些威胁占上风。防护和保护法术，如{@spell leomund's tiny hut|PHB|tiny hut}或{@spell rope trick}，对于在危险地区的长途跋涉中生存很有价值。",
	"One additional consequence of the state of social isolation in Etharis: information travels very slowly. With no reliable messengers and limited magic, adventurers are sometimes the main source of communication between settlements. This can lead to problems, but can also work to the characters' advantage if they don't want news of their exploits spread.": "在Etharis，社会孤立状态的一个额外后果是：信息传播非常缓慢。由于没有可靠的信使和有限的魔法，冒险者有时是定居点之间沟通的主要来源。这可能会导致一些问题，但如果他们不想让自己的事迹传出去，也可能对他们有利。",
	"When faced with difficult circumstances, there are those who rise to the occasion and act out of charitable intentions and seek to help those in need. In a dark fantasy setting, most people fall on the other side of the coin. Etharis is populated mainly by those who look out for themselves, often to the detriment of others. Whether it's scheming nobles living in the lap of luxury on the hard work of others or superstitious townsfolk doing whatever is necessary to keep from drowning in the terrible ocean of poverty, the people of Etharis are always looking at what they get out of any agreement. In this world, xenophobia, paranoia, and plain cruelty are the order of the day.": "在面临困难的情况下，有些人奋不顾身，出于慈善的意图而采取行动，寻求帮助需要帮助的人。在一个黑暗的幻想环境中，大多数人属于硬币的另一面。伊萨里斯的居民主要是那些为自己着想的人，他们常常损害他人的利益。无论是诡计多端的贵族依靠他人的辛勤劳动而生活在奢华之中，还是迷信的乡民为了不被淹没在可怕的贫困海洋中而不择手段，伊萨里斯的人们总是在关注他们从任何协议中得到的东西。在这个世界上，排外主义、偏执狂和普通的残忍是一天中的主流。",
	"Dealing with NPCs is a cornerstone of roleplaying, but the aforementioned conditions make it an especially dicey proposition in Etharis. Help is not something given freely by the strangers you meet in the world. Even an easy smile and a honeyed tongue have their limits, so be prepared to deal with people on less charitable terms.": "与NPC打交道是角色扮演的基石，但上述条件使它在Etharis成为一个特别危险的命题。你在这个世界上遇到的陌生人不会随意提供帮助。即使是轻松的微笑和甜言蜜语也有其局限性，所以要准备好在不太友好的条件下与人打交道。",
	"Bribery, intimidation, coercion, and sometimes outright blackmail are more common than appeals for mercy or sympathy. Knowing what the other person wants is a valuable piece of information when trying to come to some sort of arrangement, so wisdom is just as important as charisma. Spells such as charm person may seem like an easy answer, but the fear and hatred of magic in Etharis are amplified when used to usurp a person's will. And those spells do wear off.": "贿赂、恐吓、胁迫，有时甚至是赤裸裸的勒索，都比呼吁怜悯或同情更常见。当试图达成某种安排时，知道对方想要什么是很有价值的信息，所以智慧与魅力同样重要。诸如 \"魅惑 \"之类的法术似乎是一个简单的答案，但在Etharis，对魔法的恐惧和憎恨在用来篡夺一个人的意志时被放大了。而且这些法术确实会失效。",
	"This mistrust and paranoia in Etharis make some abilities, afterthoughts in other types of campaigns or settings, extremely valuable. Boons provided by your background abilities, for example, may save your life as much as a quick weapon or a fireball. Being able to rely on friends for a meal and a safe shelter can be some of your most powerful tools when dealing with other people, especially in a low-charisma party. The ability to find at least one friendly face in a new town may be the difference between life and death.": "在Etharis，这种不信任和偏执使得一些能力，在其他类型的战役或环境中是事后的，变得非常有价值。例如，由你的背景能力提供的好处，可能会像快速武器或火球一样拯救你的生命。在与其他人打交道时，能够依靠朋友提供一顿饭和一个安全的住所可能是你最有力的工具，特别是在一个低查里斯玛的聚会中。在一个新的城镇中，能够找到至少一张友好的面孔可能是生与死的区别。",
	"Despite the many abilities, magical items, and other advantages an adventurer has over the common citizen of Etharis, characters still face an uphill battle. The threats arrayed against them are legion, and many are strong enough to rip the very fabric of reality asunder. As a result, characters must be aware that they are not at the top of the food chain. The danger is very real, and death is a constant possibility. Those who rise to great heights do so only after a long and difficult struggle—and the fall from those heights is all the more dangerous.": "尽管冒险者拥有许多能力、魔法物品和其他优于Etharis普通公民的优势，但角色仍然面临着一场艰苦的战斗。针对他们的威胁是巨大的，许多威胁足以将现实的结构撕成碎片。因此，人物必须意识到他们并不处于食物链的顶端。危险是非常真实的，死亡是一种持续的可能性。那些上升到很高的高度的人，只有在经过漫长而艰难的斗争之后才会这样做--而从这些高度上掉下来就更加危险了。",
	"What this means in game terms is that the player characters are relatively weaker than in traditional fantasy roleplaying campaigns. Progression to higher levels often requires greater effort and greater sacrifice than some players are used to. This is an element of dark fantasy and reflects the theme of constant danger. When building a character, it's wise not to take progression for granted and focus more on immediate viability. A character that will only come into its own after it gains four levels to pick up that one spell or feat you need is a character that will likely not survive through four levels.": "在游戏中，这意味着玩家角色比传统的幻想角色扮演活动中的角色相对较弱。晋级到更高的级别往往需要比一些玩家习惯的更大的努力和更大的牺牲。这是黑暗幻想的一个元素，反映了持续危险的主题。在建立一个角色时，明智的做法是不要把进阶视为理所当然，而应更多地关注眼前的生存能力。一个角色只有在获得四级后才会发挥自己的作用，以获得你需要的那个法术或特技，这个角色很可能无法通过四级生存。",
	"Long-term planning is definitely an option, however. Many of the options presented in this book are designed with continual progression in mind. The key is not to rest all your hopes on the assumption of future levels. With danger all around, the future becomes a very uncertain prospect, and it's often more helpful to focus on surviving the present.": "然而，长期规划绝对是一种选择。本书中提出的许多选择都是在考虑到持续进步的情况下设计的。关键是不要把所有的希望都寄托在对未来水平的假设上。在危险四伏的情况下，未来会变得非常不确定，把注意力集中在当前的生存上往往更有帮助。",
	"A knight stands, chest heaving, amid the remains of an undead legion. Around her are bodies not just of the creatures she fought, but also her fallen comrades. She stands perfectly still, though she feels the wound in her side beginning to fester. Behind her the villagers begin to peek out from their hovels to see that disaster has been narrowly averted.": "一位骑士站在亡灵军团的残骸中，胸口剧烈起伏。在她周围，不仅有与她战斗的生物的尸体，还有她倒下的战友。她一动不动地站着，尽管她感觉到自己身边的伤口开始溃烂。在她身后，村民们开始从他们的小屋里探出头来，看到灾难已经勉强避免了。",
	"These are the types of victories to be found in Etharis. Hard-fought battles, won at a steep price, but worth the cost nonetheless. Success is not guaranteed. Victories have very real costs, and in some cases those costs are the very morals and ideals of the \"heroes\" who pay them.": "这些都是在Etharis发现的胜利类型。艰苦的战斗，以高昂的代价赢得的，但还是值得付出代价。成功是没有保证的。胜利有非常真实的代价，在某些情况下，这些代价正是支付这些代价的 \"英雄 \"的道德和理想。",
	"A dark fantasy setting is one in which good does not always vanquish evil, and the players are not always the heroes. There is no great final battle between the forces of light and darkness, the victories that occur are temporary and fleeting. They are battles rather than wars. But they are still victories.": "黑暗幻想的环境中，正义并不总是战胜邪恶，而玩家也不总是英雄。光明和黑暗的力量之间没有伟大的最终战役，所发生的胜利是暂时的和短暂的。它们是战斗而不是战争。但它们仍然是胜利。",
	"Being a player in Etharis is to be a character willing to sacrifice for their goals, and who realizes that each victory is still cause for celebration. Deciding your character's motivations and goals in this world often means narrowing your focus. There is little glory to be found, so personal stakes are more appropriate. Whether it be to heal your sick sibling or to finish the work of your departed mentor, Etharis lends itself to these shortterm, attainable goals. The grand adventures against impossible odds to save the world from the evils that surround it... those are stories for a later time.": "在Etharis中，作为一个玩家，就是要成为一个愿意为自己的目标而牺牲的角色，并意识到每一次胜利都是值得庆祝的。在这个世界上决定你的角色的动机和目标往往意味着缩小你的焦点。没有什么荣耀可言，所以个人的利害关系更合适。无论是治愈你生病的兄弟姐妹还是完成你死去的导师的工作，Etharis都适合这些短期的、可实现的目标。为了从周围的邪恶中拯救世界而进行的不可能的冒险......那是以后的故事了。",
	"Despite the dire circumstances facing the world, hope still remains. It may be scattered, dimmed, assaulted on all sides, but it has not been extinguished. A farmer stands against the oncoming soldiers, giving his friends and family time to flee. A merchant, with a kindly smile, hands a loaf of bread to a poor beggar. A paladin, the last of his order, continues his quest to rid the world of a demon-prince. Across Etharis, small acts of kindness, of bravery, of charity, all stand out amid the dark backdrop. Few and far between, their scarcity only serves to make them more special.": "尽管世界面临着严峻的形势，希望仍然存在。它可能是分散的，暗淡的，受到四面八方的攻击，但它并没有被扑灭。一个农民站在那里抵抗迎面而来的士兵，让他的朋友和家人有时间逃离。一个商人，带着亲切的微笑，将一块面包递给一个可怜的乞丐。一个圣骑士，他的最后一个教团，继续他的追求，为世界摆脱一个恶魔王子。在整个Etharis，善良、勇敢、慈善的小行为在黑暗的背景下显得格外突出。它们的数量很少，它们的稀缺性只会使它们更加特别。",
	"Players should also realize that the characters they meet do not expect any sort of charity or kindness by their characters. Such acts are usually met with suspicion, and the players must be prepared to act accordingly. One might challenge the NPCs' expectations, seeking to sway them to your cause. Alternatively, a player's character might disguise their charity in order to avoid any conflict that might complicate the matter, such as slipping extra coin into a delivery so that it seems accidental.": "玩家还应该意识到，他们遇到的人物并不指望他们的角色有任何形式的慈善或善意。这种行为通常会受到怀疑，玩家必须准备好相应的行动。一个人可能会挑战NPC的期望，寻求让他们对你的事业产生动摇。另外，玩家的角色可能会伪装他们的慈善行为，以避免任何可能使事情复杂化的冲突，例如在送货时塞进额外的硬币，使其看起来是意外的。",
	"These suggestions are intended to help guide players through the dark fantasy world of Etharis, but they remain merely that: suggestions. Your actions are ultimately yours to decide. As you make these choices and face challenges throughout your journey, know that each path you take will have consequences, for good or ill. How you face the situations presented will define your character and the story surrounding them. People can change based on their experiences, and a player should take into consideration everything their character has done in deciding how they will react to things in the future. Some extreme events may shift alignment, change motivations and goals, or alter a character's bonds, ideals, and flaws in surprising ways. Accepting the direction your character takes, even if it isn't one that you had planned on, often results in a more rewarding experience.": "这些建议的目的是帮助引导玩家在黑暗的伊萨利斯世界中进行游戏，但它们仍然只是建议。你的行动最终由你自己决定。当你在整个旅程中做出这些选择和面对挑战时，要知道你所走的每一条路都会产生后果，无论好坏。你如何面对所呈现的情况将决定你的性格和围绕它们的故事。人们可以根据他们的经历而改变，玩家在决定他们将来对事情的反应时，应该考虑到他们的角色所做的一切。一些极端事件可能会改变排列组合，改变动机和目标，或者以令人惊讶的方式改变角色的纽带、理想和缺陷。接受你的角色所采取的方向，即使它不是你所计划的方向，往往会带来更有价值的经验。",
	"Your decisions will also shape your version of Etharis. Characters you meet may show up later to influence important moments in the story. Word of your deeds spreads, albeit slowly, between settlements. GMs may set the overarching plot for a campaign, but your actions provide the building blocks they use in the future. In this way, the characters and the world around them reinforce one another to form a complete, cohesive narrative. Etharis is, above all else, a world of difficult choices and serious consequences. Choose wisely.": "你的决定也将塑造你的Etharis版本。你遇到的人物可能会在以后出现，影响故事中的重要时刻。你的事迹会在各定居点之间传播，尽管速度很慢。总经理可以为一个活动设定总体情节，但你的行动为他们提供了未来使用的基石。通过这种方式，人物和他们周围的世界相互加强，形成一个完整的、有凝聚力的叙述。最重要的是，Etharis是一个充满困难选择和严重后果的世界。选择是明智的。",

	"A mother hears a sound in the night and worriedly checks on her sleeping toddler. Nothing appears amiss, but weeks later the glamour fades and the true horror is revealed: the child has been stolen by the faerie, and a wechselkind is left in its place. The faerie are callous and unchanging beings, so nothing sparks their fascination (and their envy) more than the malleable, bright spark of a young human child.": "一位母亲在夜里听到了声音，担心地查看她熟睡的孩子。似乎没有什么不妥，但几周后，魅力消失了，真正的恐怖被揭示出来：孩子被小精灵偷走了，留下了一个wechselkind代替他。小精灵是冷酷无情、一成不变的生命，所以没有什么比一个年轻的人类孩子的可塑性、明亮的火花更能激发他们的魅力（和他们的嫉妒）。",
	"A wechselkind is a construct crafted of wood, clay, and ceramic in the form of a small child, animated by faerie magic and concealed in a glamour that makes them appear identical to a stolen mortal babe. Once the glamour fades and the lie is revealed, the wechselkind is often cast out by its foster family, if not destroyed.": "wechselkind是一种用木头、粘土和陶瓷制作的小孩子的形状，由精灵魔法激活，并隐藏在一种魅力中，使他们看起来与被盗的凡人婴儿相同。一旦魅力消失，谎言被揭穿，wechselkind即使不被摧毁，也会被其寄养家庭赶走。",
	"Occasionally, though, a family takes pity on the poor creature and attempts to raise it as they would a child, only to find that while their mind develops normally, a wechselkind is forever bound in the unchanging form of a childlike doll.": "不过，偶尔也会有家庭同情这个可怜的生物，并试图像抚养孩子一样抚养它，结果发现，虽然他们的头脑发育正常，但wechselkind却永远被束缚在一个像孩子一样的玩偶的不变的形式中。",
	"Whether nurtured or shunned, the wechselkind eventually finds itself an outcast in the world and must fend for itself as best it can. With few physical needs, the wechselkind often wanders from place to place, watching the people it encounters with envious eyes, hoping for a place to finally fit in.": "不管是被培养还是被回避，wechselkind最终发现自己是世界上的弃儿，必须尽可能地自力更生。由于身体上的需求很少，腊肠动物经常从一个地方流浪到另一个地方，用羡慕的眼光看着它遇到的人，希望有一个地方能最终适应。",
	"The residual magic of its faerie glamour allows it to conceal itself in the guise of a human child, and a lone wechselkind often takes to begging by the side of the road or doing odd jobs around an isolated farmhouse, searching for some scraps of acceptance or a small trinket or two to take with it when it must inevitably move on.": "它的精灵魅力的残余魔力使它能够以人类儿童的伪装掩盖自己，而一个孤独的wechselkind经常在路边乞讨，或在一个孤立的农舍周围做零工，寻找一些接受的碎片或一两个小饰品，以便在它必须不可避免地继续前进时带走。",
	"Recently, with the advent of the Weeping Pox, the wechselkind have started to emerge from hiding and be recognized as a separate race of creatures. With their immunity to disease, a number of wechselkind have offered their services as nurses and doctor's assistants in plague-stricken regions, gaining recognition and praise from those able to see beyond their tragic beginnings. These wechselkind are grateful for a sense of purpose and a place to belong, but remain wary. Once their usefulness is at an end, they know they may be cast out once more.": "最近，随着 \"哭泣之痘 \"的出现，wechselkind已经开始从隐藏中出现，并被承认为一个独立的生物种族。由于他们对疾病的免疫力，一些wechselkind人在受瘟疫困扰的地区提供护士和医生助理的服务，获得了那些能够超越其悲惨出身的人的认可和赞誉。这些wechselkind对目标感和归属感心存感激，但仍保持警惕。一旦他们的作用结束，他们知道他们可能会再次被驱逐出去。",
	"Deep beneath the waves lies the Llana'Shi Empire. An ancient race, the laneshi straddle the line between life and death, communing with spirits for guidance and unafraid to meet death on the battlefield. Pale humanoids with manes of kelp-like hair, they seek the underlying duality of everything they encounter. A laneshi is more likely than not to view matters in absolutes and react accordingly. Friend or foe. Day or night. Acceptance or rejection. All things must have their place, and to this end they have developed a rigid caste system.": "在海浪的深处有一个拉纳什帝国。作为一个古老的种族，拉纳西人跨越了生与死的界限，他们与神灵交流，寻求指引，并毫不畏惧地在战场上迎接死亡。他们是苍白的人形生物，有着海藻般的头发，他们寻求他们所遇到的一切事物的潜在的双重性。Laneshi更有可能以绝对的方式看待问题并作出相应的反应。朋友或敌人。白天或夜晚。接受或拒绝。所有的东西都必须有自己的位置，为此，他们已经开发了一个严格的种姓制度。",
	"The mystic caste comprises all those laneshi who are born as twins, a very common occurrence. When this happens, the first-born of the pair is inducted into the mystic caste, while the other twin is consecrated as his or her sibling's spirit guide. Using a powerful necromantic ritual, the second twin is sacrificed and its soul bound within the body of the other. Each member of the mystic caste is therefore possessed of two souls: one living and one dead. This grants them vision into the spirit world and heightens their necromantic abilities. Mystics are in charge of all things that possess no life, and are therefore in charge of funeral rites, crafting, construction, recordkeeping, and food preparation. Heavier duties are usually performed with the aid of undead labor.": "神秘的种姓包括所有那些生为双胞胎的巷子，这是一种非常常见的情况。当这种情况发生时，这对双胞胎中的第一个孩子会被纳入神秘种姓，而另一个双胞胎则被奉为他或她兄弟姐妹的精神向导。使用一个强大的亡灵仪式，第二个双胞胎被牺牲，其灵魂被束缚在另一个人的身体里。因此，神秘主义种姓的每个成员都拥有两个灵魂：一个活着，一个死去。这赋予他们进入精神世界的视野，并增强了他们的死灵能力。神秘主义者负责所有没有生命的东西，因此负责葬礼仪式、工艺、建筑、记录和食物准备。较重的职责通常是在不死生物的帮助下完成的。",
	"The second caste, the warrior caste, is in charge of all things relating to the living. This includes not only warfare, but also ruling, diplomacy, farming, the raising and educating of children, and so forth. The warrior caste is roughly double the size of the mystic caste and is structured as a meritocracy, with great deeds leading to greater status. The laneshi are constantly at war with their deep-dwelling neighbors, and use their ability to speak with the marine wildlife to find opportunities for heroism and advancement.": "第二个种姓，即战士种姓，负责所有与生活有关的事情。这不仅包括战争，还包括统治、外交、耕作、儿童的抚养和教育等等。战士种姓的规模大约是神秘种姓的两倍，其结构是一种功绩制，伟大的事迹会导致更高的地位。Laneshi人经常与他们的深居邻居发生战争，并利用他们与海洋野生动物对话的能力来寻找英雄主义和进步的机会。",
	"Despite this, the rulers of the Llana'Shi Empire have recently turned their eyes toward the surface for unknown reasons. Perhaps some new and greater threat is stirring in the dark depths of the sea, and the Laneshi seek aid from their air-breathing cousins. Or perhaps the rumors of mysterious visitors to the royal palace and blasphemous compacts with ancient evils are true, and the laneshi king is looking for new lands to conquer to appease the hunger of his unnamable master.": "尽管如此，拉纳什帝国的统治者最近出于未知的原因将目光转向了海面。也许一些新的和更大的威胁正在黑暗的海洋深处蠢蠢欲动，拉纳西人向他们呼吸着空气的表亲寻求援助。或者，关于王宫的神秘访客和与古代邪恶的亵渎性契约的传言是真的，兰尼希国王正在寻找新的土地来征服，以安抚他那不可名状的主人的饥渴。",
	"Smoke rose into the night as two brothers fled the burning village of Kolyat. They ran as fast as their feet could carry them, stopping after hiding themselves in the brush. Only then did they look back.": "当两兄弟逃离着火的科利亚特村时，浓烟升入夜幕。他们拼命地跑，把自己藏在灌木丛中，然后停下来。只有在那时，他们才回头看。",
	"The sparks from their home lit up the darkness, a mockery of shooting stars. Screams and inhuman growls drifted toward them, warning them that the danger hadn't passed.": "他们家的火花照亮了黑暗，是对流星的嘲弄。尖叫声和非人的咆哮声向他们飘来，警告他们危险还没有过去。",
	"Mischa touched his elder brother's shoulder. \"Laszlo? Are Papa and Mama...?\"": "米沙碰了碰他哥哥的肩膀。\"拉兹洛？爸爸和妈妈是不是......？\"",

	"Mischa had rarely seen his brother weep. Laszlo was the strong one, the one their parents relied on, who drove the bullies away. Yet now, he was broken. They both were.": "米沙很少看到他的哥哥流泪。拉斯洛是个坚强的人，是他们的父母所依赖的人，他把欺负他的人赶走。然而现在，他已经崩溃了。他们两个都是。",
	"Count Branimir. The name lit a dark flame in Mishca's mind. Their father had refused the Count's offer to buy their land for a tenth of its value. More, their father convinced the entire village not to sell. For their defiance, the Count's vampires extracted a terrible price.": "布兰尼米尔伯爵。这个名字在米什卡的脑海中点燃了一团黑暗的火焰。他们的父亲拒绝了伯爵以十分之一的价格购买他们土地的提议。而且，他们的父亲说服了整个村子的人不要卖。对于他们的蔑视，伯爵的吸血鬼们索取了可怕的代价。",
	"Mischa held his brother tightly. \"Branimir will pay,\" he whispered, tracing a symbol over his heart. \"By Lady Vengeance's name, I swear: we will make him pay.\"": "米沙紧紧地抱着他的兄弟。\"布兰尼米尔会付出代价的，\"他低声说，在他的心脏上描画一个符号。\"以复仇女神的名义，我发誓：我们会让他付出代价。\"",

	"Raevo lay 80 miles away.": "雷沃位于80英里之外。",
	"The populous races of Etharis all have stories about the ogresh, although few have seen them in person. Stories describe them as solitary wise men and women who serve as founts of information and advice for the nearby communities. Adventure tales abound where the protagonist receives counsel from an ogresh before setting off on their quest, and yet others describe royal advisors with a distinctive set of wide features. Regardless of the veracity of such tales, the ogresh still exist across the continent, viewed as something of an exotic oddity.": "伊萨里斯的众多种族都有关于奥格列斯的故事，尽管很少有人见过他们本人。故事描述他们是孤独的智者，为附近的社区提供信息和建议。冒险故事中，主人公在出发探险前接受了奥格雷什的建议，还有一些故事描述了具有独特宽广特征的皇家顾问。不管这些故事的真实性如何，奥格雷特人仍然存在于整个大陆，被视为一种异国情调的怪人。",
	"In truth, the scarcity of the ogresh is a result of their particular biology. Young ogresh mature slowly, and during their extended youth, which may last decades, they are driven by a deep-seated sense of wanderlust. This feeling compels them to travel in search of a suitable area to settle, consisting of ample natural resources, a local population of sentient creatures, and a lack of other ogresh nearby. Once they decide upon an area, an ogresh enters the second stage of their life, which is marked by a drastically increased appetite and a mostly sedentary lifestyle. More than a single ogresh could easily deplete the surplus of a small village, so the reason for their wanderlust is a simple case of biological necessity.": "事实上，奥格雷特的稀缺性是其特殊生物学特性的结果。年轻的奥格雷人成熟得很慢，在他们可能持续几十年的漫长青春期，他们被一种根深蒂固的流浪感所驱使。这种感觉迫使他们去寻找一个合适的地区定居，包括充足的自然资源、当地的有生命的生物，以及附近缺乏其他奥格雷人。一旦决定了一个地区，奥格瑞特就进入了生命的第二个阶段，其特点是食欲大增，大部分时间都是静止不动的生活。一个以上的奥格瑞特可以轻易地耗尽一个小村庄的盈余，所以他们的流浪癖是一个简单的生物需要的案例。",
	"Given their reliance on other species, it comes as no surprise that the ogresh are masters of social interaction. Each individual is born with an inherent ability to read body language and vocal cues helpful in discerning the attitude of others. Indeed, the vast stores of knowledge often attributed to the ogresh is a reflection of their uncanny ability to glean information about an individual through these subtle clues. Even a casual conversation could end up revealing far more than one would intend to these keen observers, and the ogresh are smart enough to capitalize on such information.": "鉴于他们对其他物种的依赖，奥格雷特人是社会交往的大师，这一点并不奇怪。每个人都有一种与生俱来的能力，能够读懂身体语言和声音线索，有助于辨别他人的态度。事实上，通常归功于奥格雷特人的大量知识储备，反映了他们通过这些微妙的线索收集个人信息的不可思议的能力。对于这些敏锐的观察者来说，即使是一次不经意的谈话，最终透露出的信息也会远远超过人们的预期，而奥格雷人足够聪明，可以利用这些信息。",
	"With the end of the God-War, the Arch Seraphs of each deity descended upon the world, each taking upon their own shoulders the burden of imposing order on a world cast into disarray. These Arch Seraphs were the most powerful lieutenants among the angelic hosts, strong enough to retain a semblance of their power following the tragedy. The lesser angels were not so lucky. Many found themselves wholly bereft of their powers, cast down to Etharis to live out their nowmortal lives amidst the lesser races.": "随着神战的结束，每个神祗的大蛇夫都降临到这个世界上，每个人都肩负着将秩序强加给这个陷入混乱的世界的重任。这些大蛇夫是天使群体中最强大的副手，强大到足以在悲剧发生后保留其权力的影子。较小的天使就没那么幸运了。许多人发现自己完全失去了力量，被扔到伊萨里斯，在低等种族中度过他们现在的不朽生活。",
	"The downcast, as they have come to be called, are far fewer in number than when they first arrived, with a great number of them succumbing to despair and sickness after their fall from grace. Of those who remain, some still serve the Arch Seraphs in their twisted crusades, hoping to reclaim what they have lost. Others have turned their backs on their former comrades to seek their own goals, fully embracing mortal life. Lastly are those who feel embittered by their fall and have been gleefully accepted by the Arch Demons as agents to spread fear and destruction.": "堕落者，就像他们被称为的那样，数量比他们刚来时少得多，其中大量的人在堕落后屈服于绝望和疾病。在那些留下来的人中，有些人仍然在扭曲的十字军中为大蛇神服务，希望能夺回他们失去的东西。其他人则背弃了他们以前的战友，寻求他们自己的目标，完全拥抱凡人的生活。最后是那些对自己的堕落感到愤懑的人，他们被大恶魔欣然接受，成为传播恐惧和毁灭的代理人。",
	"Physically, the downcast still possess the beauty of their angelic forms, although they no longer shine as brightly as before. The mark of the divine still remains as a visible glow within their eyes, and faint markings on their skin mimic Celestial runes.": "在身体上，堕落者仍然拥有天使般的美丽，尽管他们不再像以前那样闪耀。神圣的印记仍然保留在他们的眼睛里，是一种可见的光芒，他们皮肤上的微弱标记模仿了天体的符文。",
	"There is also variation based on the deity that each served in the past. Those who follow Maligant are physically stronger, Galt's host are hardy and resilient, Ulmyr's are possessed of a keen intellect, and Aurelia's kin have softer features and soothing voices.": "也有基于每个人过去服务的神灵的变化。追随马利根的人身体更强壮，高尔特的主人坚韧而有弹性，乌尔米尔的人拥有敏锐的智力，而奥蕾莉亚的亲属则拥有柔和的特征和舒缓的声音。",
	"Over time, the downcast have learned to tap into the small shreds of divine power that lie sleeping within their blood. That power still remembers the downcast's former purpose and can be harnessed in times of great need to aid those who once called upon the gods for their power. This ability is as dangerous as it is powerful, for there are many who would seek to take it by force. Fallen clergy who seek to drain the downcast in order to restore their own failing powers, vampires seeking to drink from a fountain of the tainted divine, even those who treat with powerful entities alien to this world, are all potential predators to a fallen angel. Indeed, there are some who have already discovered this secret and are willing to go to any lengths in order to obtain it.": "随着时间的推移，沉沦者已经学会了利用沉睡在他们血液中的一小部分神力。这种力量仍然记得堕落者以前的目的，并且可以在非常需要的时候利用它来帮助那些曾经呼唤神灵力量的人。这种能力既危险又强大，因为有很多人想用武力夺取它。堕落的神职人员为了恢复他们自己衰弱的力量而试图吸干堕落者的能量，吸血鬼试图喝下被污染的神性之泉，甚至那些与这个世界上的强大实体相联系的人，都是堕落天使的潜在掠夺者。事实上，有些人已经发现了这个秘密，并愿意为获得它而不惜一切代价。",
	"History repeats itself. Even before the humans had their Eras of Expansion and Descent, other races had built empires on Etharis. The elves and the dwarves both had their time, and other, older races did as well. Where the dwarves of Stehlenwald live today was once the seat of an ancient empire that surpassed any that have come since. The name of this empire has been lost, and only fragmented remains of the oldest stories even hint at the grand heights that race once reached.": "历史会重演。甚至在人类有他们的扩张和后裔时代之前，其他种族就已经在Etharis建立了帝国。精灵和矮人都有他们的时代，其他更古老的种族也是如此。今天斯泰伦瓦尔德的矮人居住的地方曾经是一个古老帝国的所在地，它超越了后来的任何一个帝国。这个帝国的名字已经消失了，只有最古老的故事的碎片化遗迹甚至暗示了那个种族曾经达到的宏伟高度。",
	"What can be gleaned from the histories of the elves and dwarves is that at one point a horrible calamity befell the land, wiping clean any trace of this ancient empire. The disaster came suddenly and without warning, and it was believed that nothing survived. Something did.": "从精灵和矮人的历史中可以收集到的信息是，在某一时刻，一场可怕的灾难降临在这片土地上，将这个古老帝国的任何痕迹抹去。这场灾难来得很突然，没有任何警告，人们相信没有任何东西能够幸存下来。有些东西确实存在。",
	"When the humans rose to power and began threatening the elves and dwarves, the Stehlenwald dwarves were forced to dig deeper into their mountain strongholds in order to withstand the siege. Deep in the dark, even below the adamantine that proved to be their salvation, the dwarves found sealed chambers dating back to before the cataclysm. With the seal broken, an ancient spell was lifted and the chambers' inhabitants began to stir from their millennia-long slumber.": "当人类崛起并开始威胁精灵和矮人的时候，斯泰伦瓦尔德的矮人被迫在他们的山地据点中挖掘得更深，以抵御围攻。在黑暗深处，甚至在被证明是他们的救命稻草的金刚砂下面，矮人发现了可以追溯到大灾变之前的密封室。随着封印被打破，一个古老的咒语被解除，密室中的居民开始从他们长达千年的沉睡中醒来。",
	"In the days before the calamity wiped out their civilization, a group of these \"dreamers\" foresaw the danger and came up with a plan to survive it. Time passes differently in dreams, and the ancients sought to use that fact to free themselves from the flow of time. Suspended between reality and dreams, sealed deep underground, they could live in a state of perpetual slumber for as long as necessary and outlast the disaster that would wipe out the rest of their kind.": "在灾难消灭他们的文明之前的日子里，这些 \"做梦的人 \"中有一群人预见到了危险，并想出了一个在灾难中生存的计划。时间在梦中的流逝是不同的，古人试图利用这一事实将自己从时间的流逝中解放出来。悬浮在现实和梦境之间，封存在地下深处，只要有必要，他们就可以生活在永久的沉睡状态中，并在那场将消灭他们其他物种的灾难中幸存下来。",
	"The plan worked, but living for so long within the dream-world had unforeseen consequences. Upon waking, the dreamers found that they could no longer differentiate between dreams and memories, with both fading quickly from their minds. The result was the emergence of a new race with no knowledge of their own history, only halfformed images and dream-like impressions of a place and time that may or may not have existed.": "这个计划成功了，但在梦境中生活了这么久，却产生了不可预知的后果。醒来后，做梦的人发现他们无法再区分梦境和记忆，两者都迅速从他们的头脑中消失。结果是出现了一个新的种族，他们对自己的历史一无所知，只有半变形的图像和对一个可能存在也可能不存在的地方和时间的梦幻般的印象。",
	"Now the dreamers struggle to adapt in a world that seems like a waking nightmare. Whatever their history, they have proven to be quick-witted and strong, able to learn new tasks and execute them well. Their long slumber has left them strangely energized and able to work even beyond the legendary endurance of the dwarves. Even so, sleep is where the dreamers still feel most at home, and they have a habit of quickly dozing off whenever no immediate task presents itself.": "现在，做梦的人在一个似乎是醒着的恶梦的世界中努力适应。无论他们的历史如何，他们都被证明是头脑灵活和强壮的，能够学习新的任务并很好地执行它们。长期的沉睡使他们奇怪地精力充沛，甚至能够超越传说中的矮人的耐力。即便如此，睡眠仍然是做梦者最自在的地方，他们有一个习惯，只要没有直接的任务出现，就会迅速打瞌睡。",
	"To cast one's mind out amongst the outer planes is the dream of many an arcane spellcaster. In recent memory, none have come closer to that dubious honor than the lost city of Ulmyr's Gate. Founded by a group of ambitious wizards who chafed under the limitations imposed upon them by government bureaucracy, Ulmyr's Gate boasted free study for all mages who sought sanctuary within its walls. The Great College quickly became a lodestone for mages of every stripe from across the empire, and for a brief moment there existed a golden age of magic.": "将自己的思想投向外部世界是许多奥术施法者的梦想。在最近的记忆中，没有人比失落的城市乌尔米尔之门更接近这个可疑的荣誉。Ulmyr's Gate由一群雄心勃勃的巫师建立，他们对政府官僚机构强加给他们的限制感到不满，并为所有在其墙内寻求庇护的法师提供免费学习。大学院很快就成了整个帝国各种法师的住宿地，在一个短暂的时刻，存在着一个魔法的黄金时代。",
	"That dream came crashing down one night when the founding mages of Ulmyr's Gate attempted a massive conjuration ritual intended to part the veil and create a permanent portal to the Ethereal Plane. It didn't work. Instead their magic caused a massive rift in the very fabric of reality, and in an instant the entire city tipped into the void between worlds. The entire city was presumed dead, the Arcanist Inquisition railed against the hubris of those tampering in things man was not meant to know, and life in the Empire moved on.": "有一天晚上，这个梦想破灭了，因为乌尔米尔之门的创始法师们试图进行一个大规模的法术仪式，以分开面纱并创造一个通往虚空界的永久门户。这并不奏效。相反，他们的魔法在现实的结构中造成了一个巨大的裂缝，在一瞬间，整个城市倾倒在世界的虚空中。整个城市被认为已经死亡，奥术裁判所对那些篡改人类本不应该知道的东西的狂妄行为进行了抨击，而帝国的生活也在继续。",
	"Years later, stories surfaced of strange people being sighted in the region where Ulmyr's Gate once stood. These people seemed oddly blurred or indistinct, and some reports said they vanished right in front of witnesses' eyes. Gradually it became clear that these poor souls were the survivors of the Ethereal Rift, now trapped between worlds and trying to retain their tenuous grasp on the Material Plane.": "几年后，关于在乌尔米尔之门曾经存在的地区看到奇怪的人的故事出现了。这些人看起来很奇怪，模糊不清，有些报道说他们就在目击者眼前消失了。渐渐地，人们发现这些可怜的灵魂是虚空裂缝的幸存者，他们现在被困在各个世界之间，试图保持对物质世界的脆弱把握。",
	"The world of Etharis, like most worlds, is divided into nations. These political entities give stability to the world, while at the same time posing threats—sometimes to one another, and sometimes to their own citizens.": "像大多数世界一样，Etharis的世界被划分为国家。这些政治实体给世界带来了稳定，同时也带来了威胁--有时是对彼此，有时是对自己的公民。",

	"While Abenland is the seat of Imperial rule, it is clear that the Holy Church of the Hearthkeepers is the power behind the throne. The Hearthkeepers maintain order by preaching fidelity to the tenets of the late goddess Aurelia: kindness, humility, and temperance. Newcomers may find this odd, considering the wild, drug-fueled parties that occur every night in the city. One finds that the citizens of Altenheim are able to worship fervently each day and still not lose sleep over breaking every law of the goddess at night.": "虽然阿本兰是帝国统治的所在地，但很明显，守炉人的神圣教会是王位背后的力量。守炉人通过宣扬忠于已故女神奥蕾莉亚的信条来维持秩序：仁慈、谦逊和节制。新来的人可能会觉得这很奇怪，因为考虑到城市里每天晚上都会发生疯狂的、以毒品为燃料的聚会。人们发现，阿尔滕海姆的市民能够每天狂热地崇拜，并且仍然不会因为在晚上违反女神的每一条法律而失眠。",
	"There isn't a desire or whim that can't be sated in the City of Joy. With its trade routes and acres of farmland, Abendland is one of the richest provinces in Etharis. The Silverstream Markets offer goods from as far north as Grarjord to as far south as Sante Viegre. Those eager to sample the culture of the Bürach Empire can visit the Bard Colleges and the famous Starhold Theatre. For the more religiously inclined, they can learn much from the priests of the Grand Temple of Aurelia. Finally, those looking for a good time can hardly do better than the many-storied Caledan Inn, open at all hours and usually booked full.": "在欢乐之城，没有什么欲望或奇思妙想不能得到满足。阿本德兰拥有贸易路线和大片的农田，是伊萨利斯最富有的省份之一。银流市场提供从最北边的格拉乔德到最南边的圣维格尔的商品。那些渴望品尝比拉赫帝国文化的人可以参观巴德学院和著名的斯塔霍德剧院。对于更有宗教信仰的人来说，他们可以从奥蕾莉亚大神庙的牧师那里学到很多东西。最后，那些寻找美好时光的人很难有比历史悠久的卡里丹客栈更好的选择，它随时开放，通常都是满员。",
	"Newcomers to Abendland and the Empire would do well to familiarise themselves with the laws of the land. One recent law stands out: it is a crime to talk of the Great Beast. The Hearthkeepers deny any such being exists and forbid any discussion of it. Gossip of this threat is considered a grave insult to the Church, doubtlessly landing the speaker behind bars. Yet simultaneously, the Hearthkeepers made it a serious crime to withhold any information regarding the Beast. All encounters with the entity must be reported to the Hearthkeepers, and all its monstrous progeny must be destroyed. Failure to do so may arouse suspicion that you are in league with the unmentionable entity.": "新到阿本德兰和帝国的人最好熟悉一下这里的法律。最近有一条法律很突出：谈论伟大的野兽是一种犯罪。守炉人否认有这样的生物存在，并禁止对其进行任何讨论。关于这种威胁的流言被认为是对教会的严重侮辱，无疑会使说话者身陷囹圄。然而与此同时，守炉人将隐瞒任何有关野兽的信息定为严重犯罪。所有与该实体的接触都必须向守炉人报告，并且必须销毁其所有的畸形后代。如果不这样做，可能会引起怀疑，你和这个不可告人的实体是一伙的。",

	"West Nordenland specializes in arcane magic. The city of Erlefurt began as a mage college, training wizards for many years before growing into a city. A total of eight wizard schools have since arisen in Nordenland, and while graduating from one is considered a great honor, Erlefurt's Magister College is considered the foremost institution for arcane magic, rivalled only by the Ravencourt Sanctuary in Ostoya. Scrolls, spellbooks, and various magic items abound in the shops along Viternas Lane. Archduchess Maelfa and her magistrate focus on training more mages to cement her importance to the Imperial family and to hold the East in check.": "西诺登兰擅长奥术魔法。埃尔富特市最初是一所法师学院，在发展成为城市之前，培养了很多年的魔法师。此后，诺登兰共出现了八所巫师学校，虽然从其中一所毕业被认为是一种巨大的荣誉，但埃尔富特的法师学院被认为是最重要的奥术魔法机构，只有奥斯托亚的拉文库特圣地可以与之媲美。在维特纳斯大街的商店里，卷轴、法术书和各种魔法物品比比皆是。大公夫人梅尔法和她的行政官专注于培训更多的法师，以巩固她在皇室的重要性，并牵制东方。",
	"Meanwhile, East Nordenland draws magic entirely from the natural world. The capital city of Ulmirac houses the Order of the Golden Bough, the most powerful druid sect in the Empire. Nearly everything worth learning about nature can be found in their Library of Trees.

People from all over the continent come to Stehlenwald in hopes of learning from its schools of architecture, woodwork, stonecraft, and most of all, smithing.

The other clans maintain a presence in the city as well. Clan Syr is most adept at forging and supplying weapons to the Thrull army, while the powerful magics of Clan Rune keep their enemies at bay.": "泰伯恩本身被最大的部落所控制。沃尔格（Volgr）部落是一个由忠诚的战士组成的部落，是棱镜圈的肌肉，负责突袭。其他部族也在该市保持着一定的影响力。西尔氏族最擅长锻造并为瑟鲁尔军队提供武器，而符文氏族的强大魔法则让他们的敌人防不胜防。",

Such an assault has made even the most stalwart defenders falter.": "格拉乔德的其他人已经学会害怕瑟鲁尔的袭击。首先是闪电和火焰，摧毁房屋，并在镇上的防御系统中造成严重破坏。然后是震耳欲聋的战吼，沃尔格狂暴者挥舞着西斯尔制造的魔法斧和盾牌冲入战场。这样的攻击使最顽强的守卫者也动摇了。",

	"Coldfire originates from the far northern region of Volgen. It burns bright blue while giving off no heat. It can \"burn\" on ice and snow. While it is slow to spread on ice and water, once it touches organic material, it rapidly and voraciously consumes plant and animal matter, turning them into ice. Coldfire then grows and spreads rapidly in a blue conflagration. It has been observed consuming flesh, leather, grass, wood, moss, and bones. There was once a forest north of Solheim; now it is just a garden of tree-shaped ice. Even mortal creatures immune to cold cannot escape the curse of coldfire. Their flesh merely slows down the coldfire, but they eventually also turn to ice.": "冷火起源于沃尔根的最北部地区。它燃烧时呈明亮的蓝色，但不发出热量。它可以在冰和雪上 \"燃烧\"。虽然它在冰和水上的传播速度很慢，但一旦接触到有机物质，它就会迅速而贪婪地吞噬植物和动物物质，将它们变成冰。然后，冷火在蓝色的火焰中迅速增长和蔓延。据观察，它可以吞噬肉体、皮革、草、木材、苔藓和骨头。在索尔海姆北部曾经有一片森林；现在它只是一个树形冰的花园。即使是对寒冷免疫的凡人生物也无法逃脱冷火的诅咒。他们的肉体只是减缓了冷火的速度，但他们最终也会变成冰。",

Intense heat is the only known countermeasure against it, such that the scouts of Fort Kentigern have employed burning oil and even fire spells in attempts to stop its spread.": "一旦开始燃烧，冷火就很难停止。强烈的热量是唯一已知的对抗措施，肯特根堡的侦察员曾使用燃烧的油甚至火咒试图阻止其蔓延。",
	"Standing against the coldfire threat are the monks of the Order of St. Kentigern. Named after the First Hero who defeated the Great Wyrm, the Order's main function is to guard against the spread of coldfire. Their main strategy is to confine it at its source—Volgen, the island said to contain Gormadraug's heart. To that end, they keep an eternal watch on the northern lands, employing sled dogs, scouts, and ice drakes to find and fight any instance of coldfire on land and sea.": "抵抗冷火威胁的是圣肯迪根骑士团的僧侣们。骑士团以击败大巫妖的第一英雄的名字命名，其主要职能是防止冷火的蔓延。他们的主要策略是将冷火限制在它的源头--沃尔根，这个据说包含戈玛德拉克心脏的岛屿。为此，他们在北方的土地上保持着永恒的警惕，雇佣雪橇犬、侦察兵和冰龙来寻找并打击陆地和海洋上的任何冷火事件。",

	"The primary laws in the Codex include the following:": "法典中的主要法律包括以下内容。",
	"Only wizards that pass their final tests of the Erlefurt Colleges may carry the title of Erlefurt mage.": "只有通过艾尔福特学院最后测试的巫师才可以携带艾尔福特法师的称号。",
	"An Erlefurt mage shall defend their College against all who would despoil them or steal their secrets.": "一个艾尔福特法师应保卫他们的学院，反对所有掠夺他们或窃取他们秘密的人。",
	"Only the Erlefurt Colleges may train a student. All students must be registered and approved by the Colleges.": "只有艾尔福特各学院可以培训学生。所有的学生都必须经过学院的注册和批准。",
	"All magical experiments must be registered and approved by the Colleges.": "所有神奇的实验都必须登记并得到学院的批准。",
	"Any Erlefurt wizard who breaks this code of laws is hunted down by the Enforcers, a group elite abjurers highly adept at subduing one of their own. Once captured, they are taken to the magician's court and judged by the Grand Mage. If found guilty, transgressors may be magically imprisoned or even executed. As for other arcane institutions who don't subscribe to these tenets, they are treated with contempt and even outright hostility.": "任何违反这一法律准则的艾尔福特魔法师都会被执法者追捕，这是一群非常善于制服自己人的精英堕落者。一旦被抓获，他们将被带到魔法师法庭，由大法师进行审判。如果被判有罪，违法者可能会被魔法囚禁，甚至被处决。至于其他不认同这些信条的奥术机构，他们会受到蔑视，甚至是直接的敌视。",
	"As there are no established magical colleges in the Grarjord, the Valikan Clans send promising students to Erlefurt for tutelage.": "由于格拉乔德没有成熟的魔法学院，瓦利肯家族将有前途的学生送到埃尔富特进行辅导。",
	"East of Raevo's shores, hidden among the mists of its enchanted isle, the Ravencourt Sanctuary trains its mages in its own academy.": "在雷沃海岸的东边，隐藏在魔法岛的迷雾中，拉文库特圣地在自己的学院里训练法师。",
	"Unlike its rival, the Magister College, the Sanctuary believes that magic may only grow through freedom. Thus the Ravencourt Sanctuary has few laws to guide the actions of its mages. Their primary rule is that the mages must keep all the secrets of the Sanctuary safe. Apart from that, a wizard who successfully graduates from the Sanctuary is free to do what they will and teach whom they want.": "与它的对手--法师学院不同，圣域相信魔法只有通过自由才能成长。因此，拉文考特圣域没有什么法律来指导其法师的行动。他们的主要规则是，法师们必须保证圣域的所有秘密的安全。除此之外，从圣域成功毕业的法师可以自由地做他们想做的事，教他们想教的人。",
	"Despite their seeming lack of laws, the punishment for breaking the primary rule is both harsh and unequivocal. Before they leave the Sanctuary, a Ravencourt wizard swears a vow to protect their academy's secrets. They write their name on a page of an enchanted book and leave a drop of their blood on it. This creates a highly potent curse: if they should break the vow, the page tears itself from the book and burns. The wizard consequently dies an unspeakable death.": "尽管他们似乎没有法律，但对违反主要规则的惩罚既严厉又毫不含糊。在离开圣域之前，拉文考特的巫师要发誓保护他们学院的秘密。他们在魔法书的一页上写下自己的名字，并在上面留下一滴血。这就产生了一个非常有力的诅咒：如果他们违背誓言，这一页就会从书上撕下来并燃烧。巫师因此而死，死得很难看。",
	"Due to the politics of the times, the mages of Erlefurt and Ravencourt Sanctuary are technically at war. Mages from either side have standing orders to annihilate each other on sight, though this is rarely practiced.": "由于当时的政治原因，艾尔福特和拉文考特圣地的法师们在技术上处于战争状态。任何一方的法师都有见到对方就歼灭对方的长期命令，尽管这很少被实践。",
	"Having lived for thousands of years as a people, the elves are no beginners when it comes to magic. In their capital of Tol Leyemil, they have established their own college for wizards: Sarmar Academy, famous for its abjurers, mystics, and war magi.": "作为一个生活了数千年的民族，精灵们在魔法方面并不是初学者。在他们的首都托尔-莱伊米尔，他们已经建立了自己的魔法师学院。萨玛尔学院，因其培养的堕落者、神秘主义者和战争魔法师而闻名。",
	"The Sarmar mages believe that magic is learned and controlled through careful observation. By watching and listening to the natural world, the elves first learned to summon and shape numen. Thus they teach their students to pay close attention to detail and focus on what they can sense. The emphasis on patience makes teaching slow. Often, education at Sarmar can last decades. For elves, of course, that's a short period of time.": "萨玛尔法师相信，魔法是通过仔细观察来学习和控制的。通过观察和聆听自然世界，精灵们首先学会了召唤和塑造努曼。因此，他们教导学生要密切关注细节，专注于他们能感觉到的东西。对耐心的强调使教学变得缓慢。通常情况下，萨玛尔的教育可以持续几十年。当然，对于精灵来说，这只是一段短暂的时间。",
	"Being an entirely elven city, only elves may enroll in Sarmar Academy proper. The exception is Aemanyir House, a branch of the Academy located outside the city limits. This program was begun decades ago by an elven mage named Alren Corynthios as an experiment in teaching the elven way of magic to non-elves. Most of the Sarmar academicians consider this a waste of time, but Alren's persistence and connections with the elven nobility have kept the school going for many years, if just barely.": "作为一个完全的精灵城市，只有精灵可以在萨尔玛尔学院正式入学。Aemanyir之家是个例外，它是学院位于城市范围之外的一个分支。这个项目是几十年前由一位名叫阿尔伦-科伦西斯的精灵法师开始的，作为向非精灵教授精灵的魔法方式的实验。大多数萨玛尔院士认为这是浪费时间，但阿尔伦的坚持和与精灵族贵族的联系使学校维持了多年，尽管只是勉强维持。",
	"There are several unrecognised colleges in Etharis that purport to teach magic. As they tend to produce subpar mages, they're looked upon with scorn by the established colleges. At worst, they're viewed as potential sources of magical mishaps, as without proper guidance, these mages may cause irreparable harm to the reputation of all mages—or worse, bring about a magical catastrophe.": "在Etharis有几所不被承认的学院，声称是在教授魔法。由于他们倾向于培养不合格的法师，他们被那些成熟的学院所鄙视。在最坏的情况下，他们被视为潜在的魔法事故来源，因为没有适当的指导，这些法师可能会对所有法师的声誉造成不可挽回的伤害--或者更糟糕的是，带来一场魔法灾难。",
	"The Erlefurt wizards have made it their protocol to capture any \"renegade\" wizards and bring them to Erlefurt for processing and possible reeducation. Those who refuse this polite entreaty are viewed as enemy combatants.": "埃尔富特的巫师们已经把抓捕任何 \"叛变 \"的巫师作为他们的协议，并把他们带到埃尔富特进行处理并可能进行再教育。那些拒绝这种礼貌性恳求的人被视为敌方战斗人员。",
	"Society is divided in its view of arcane magic. In the Bürach Empire, for instance, it was considered a means to maintain order, project power, instill obedience, gather information, and maintain the status quo.": "社会对奥秘魔法的看法存在分歧。例如，在比拉赫帝国，它被认为是维持秩序、投射权力、灌输服从、收集信息和维持现状的一种手段。",
	"However, with the coming of the Great Beast, magic is now treated with greater suspicion, as some have come to suspect that the entity was the result of an arcane experiment gone horribly wrong. The Hearthkeepers have not denied this notion, as it deflects their own culpability on the matter.": "然而，随着巨兽的到来，现在人们对魔法更加怀疑，因为有些人开始怀疑这个实体是一个奥术实验出了大错的结果。炉灶守护者们并没有否认这种说法，因为这转移了他们自己在这件事上的责任。",
	"The Ostoyan view of magic is more varied. In the province of Soma, the lower classes fear magic as something they're incapable of understanding. They also stay clear of it to avoid inciting the jealousy and ire of the nobility. The Crimson Court believes that the use of magic is theirs by right; anyone else who uses it must either become their servant or be destroyed as a potential threat. Thus one often finds mages under their employ in their war against Raevo and the Bürach Empire.": "奥斯托亚人对魔法的看法更加多样化。在索玛省，下层阶级害怕魔法，认为这是他们无法理解的东西。他们也远离它，以避免激起贵族的嫉妒和愤怒。深红宫廷认为，使用魔法是他们的权利；其他任何使用魔法的人要么成为他们的仆人，要么作为潜在的威胁被摧毁。因此，在他们与雷沃和比拉赫帝国的战争中，人们经常会发现他们雇佣的法师。",
	"In the province of Raevo, magic is by and large an accepted part of daily life. The workshops and markets of Castalore are teeming with wizards and magical constructs, all under the watchful eye of the Ravencroft Sanctuary.": "在雷沃省，魔法基本上是日常生活中公认的一部分。卡斯塔罗尔的工场和市场充斥着巫师和魔法建筑，所有这些都在雷文克罗夫特圣地的监视之下。",
	"In the Charneault Kingdom, the elves treat magic as an integral part of their lives. They hold skilled mages in high esteem, even as they warn of the costs of seeking greater magical power.": "在Charneault王国，精灵们将魔法视为他们生活中不可或缺的一部分。他们高度尊重熟练的法师，即使他们警告寻求更大魔法力量的代价。",
	"The dark elves have no such restraint; they plumb the deepest secrets of magecraft with hardly a thought to the dangers involved. While they have attained great power, the price is often paid by the entirety of the kingdom, as is the case with the Dark Mist.": "黑暗精灵没有这样的克制；他们深究魔法的最深层秘密，几乎不考虑其中的危险性。虽然他们获得了巨大的力量，但代价往往是由整个王国付出的，就像黑暗之雾的情况。",
	"In the human-controlled lands of the Charneault, attitudes vary greatly. Mages are treated with respect in more learned circles, but among Knight Chapters they are treated with suspicion, and in the case of the Severe Templars, outright hostility. They hold elven magic accountable for the suffering endured by the populace and forego all arcane abilities in favor of strength in arms and divine fervor.": "在人类控制的查尔纳奥的土地上，人们的态度差异很大。法师在更有学问的圈子里受到尊重，但在骑士团中，他们受到怀疑，而在严酷的圣殿骑士团中，则受到直接的敌视。他们认为精灵魔法应对民众所遭受的苦难负责，并放弃了所有的奥术能力，而选择了武器的力量和神圣的狂热。",
	"It is worth noting the Castinellan Provinces in particular when it comes to magic for the specific chance they've chosen: deplorably, the theocracy is hostile to all forms of arcane magic. It is the will of Empyreus, they claim, that their people wage a righteous war against all magic-users and those who harbor them. To undertake this task, the Arcanist Inquisition has assembled a host of knights and common soldiers under the command of clerics and paladins. Backed by the power of belief, they call on divine magic to locate arcane mages and neutralise them.": "值得注意的是，当涉及到魔法的时候，卡斯蒂内兰省因为他们所选择的特殊机会而特别值得注意：令人遗憾的是，神权政府对所有形式的奥术魔法都持敌视态度。他们声称，这是Empyreus的意愿，他们的人民要对所有的魔法使用者和庇护他们的人发动一场正义的战争。为了完成这项任务，奥术师裁判所召集了一大批骑士和普通士兵，由牧师和圣骑士指挥。在信仰力量的支持下，他们召唤神圣的魔法来找到奥术师并使其失效。",
	"As such, magic-users must all be careful when entering the Castinellan Provinces, lest they be arrested, imprisoned, and very likely put to death by the Arcanist Inquisition. Mages cannot even expect sympathy from the common folk; most peasants hold all magic as witchcraft and devilry, the power of demons brought to Etharis.": "因此，魔法使用者在进入卡斯蒂内尔省时都必须小心翼翼，以免他们被逮捕、监禁，并且很可能被阿卡斯特宗教裁判所处死。法师甚至不能指望得到普通人的同情；大多数农民认为所有的魔法都是巫术和魔鬼，是恶魔带给伊萨里斯的力量。",
	"The Castinellans have yet to move against nations that employ magic, such as the Bürach and the Charneault Kingdom. But should the theocracy grow more powerful, a \"righteous war\" would certainly be in the cards.": "卡斯蒂内尔人还没有对采用魔法的国家采取行动，如布拉克和查诺特王国。但如果神权主义越来越强大，一场 \"正义的战争 \"肯定会出现。",
	"\"It can't be.\"": "\"这不可能。\"",
	"Mischa gazed at the staff in his hand as he stood with the rest of the Sanctuary's mages. Today was their final day, their graduation. Their crystal staff would glow when it was time for their departure.": "米沙凝视着他手中的法杖，他和圣域的其他法师站在一起。今天是他们的最后一天，他们的毕业典礼。当他们离开的时候，他们的水晶杖会发光。",
	"Only his did not light up.": "只有他的没有亮起来。",
	"\"You've been chosen to remain,\" the Keeper whispered in his mind. \"One life for the knowledge you've all attained.\"": "\"你们被选中留下，\"守护者在他的脑海中低声说。\"为了你们所获得的知识，一个人的生命。\"",
	"\"No,\" Mischa said. But his classmates were already teleporting away, nodding to him in commiseration. They left him alone all the same.": "\"不，\"米沙说。但是他的同学们已经传送走了，向他点头表示同情。他们还是留下了他一个人。",
	"\"I refuse!\" Mischa shouted. \"It can't be me! It can't!\" His brother's face drifted through his mind. He dropped his staff, ready to fight or flee.": "\"我拒绝！\" 米沙喊道。\"这不可能是我！它不可能！\" 他哥哥的脸在他脑海中飘过。他放下手中的法杖，准备战斗或逃跑。",
	"The Keeper appeared before him, wrapped in robes and silence. He raised a skeletal hand. \"What binds you to the outside world?\"": "守护者出现在他面前，裹在长袍里，沉默不语。他举起一只骷髅般的手。\"是什么将你与外界联系在一起？\"",
	"Mischa gasped as memories invaded his mind. The death of his parents. The burning of Kolyat. The screams. It was all too much—he fell to his knees in horror.": "米沙喘着粗气，因为记忆侵入了他的脑海。他父母的死亡。Kolyat被烧毁。那些尖叫声。这一切都太过分了，他惊恐地跪在地上。",
	"The Keeper lowered his hand. \"I have chosen well.\" After a pause, the Keeper continued. \"I have an offer. Stay five more years, and you will have all the knowledge and power you desire. What do you say?\"": "守护者放下了他的手。\"我选择得很好。\" 顿了顿，守护者继续说道。\"我有一个提议。再呆五年，你将拥有你想要的所有知识和权力。你怎么说？\"",
	"Mischa gazed into the dark void of the Keeper's hood. \"Why help me?\"": "米沙凝视着守护者头罩的黑暗虚空。\"为什么帮助我？\"",
	"The Keeper said nothing, but Mischa believed he was smiling.": "守护者没有说什么，但米沙相信他在笑。",
	"At the start of the Age of Antiquity, the gods came into being. They opened their eyes to behold a universe of wonder and chaos, and they were enamored by it. They wanted to shape it into something that resembled them. But to do that, they needed to impose order.": "在古代时代的开始，诸神出现了。他们睁开眼睛，看到了一个充满奇迹和混沌的宇宙，他们被它迷住了。他们想把它塑造成与他们相似的东西。但要做到这一点，他们需要强加秩序。",
	"The gods, good and evil alike, banded together to form a pantheon. They shaped the firmament and the seas, then the land and all the creatures that followed. They named the land Etharis and created the races to populate it.": "诸神，无论善恶，都联合起来形成了一个万神殿。他们塑造了苍穹和海洋，然后是土地和随之而来的所有生物。他们将这片土地命名为 \"伊萨里斯\"，并创造了居住在这里的种族。",
	"As these newborn mortals turned their minds to their creators, the gods found an endless font of believers. Their worship lifted the gods to greater heights, securing their ability to turn the wheel of the universe.": "当这些新生的凡人把他们的思想转向他们的创造者时，诸神发现了一个无尽的信徒的来源。他们的崇拜将诸神提升到更高的高度，保证了他们转动宇宙之轮的能力。",
	"But the gods were not alone. At the fringes of their ordered realm lurked the Aether Kindred—incomprehensible beings of pure chaos who predated the gods themselves. The Kindred were mostly content to remain uninvolved, thought occasionally the gods would find a piece of reality in disarray—a star gone missing, an ocean dried up, an entire city disappearing into the void.": "但诸神并不孤单。在他们有序领域的边缘潜伏着Aether Kindred--难以理解的纯混沌生命，他们比诸神本身还要早。Kindred大多满足于保持不参与的状态，但神明偶尔也会发现现实中的一片混乱--一颗恒星失踪了，一片海洋干涸了，整个城市消失在虚空中。",
	"When the entire race of the Sommerkin vanished one day, the gods decided they'd had enough. The Aether Kindred were an active threat to their power. The gods feared that one day all they had built would be stripped away. They need to strike now, while they still had the faith of their followers and stood at the height of their powers.": "当Sommerkin的整个种族有一天消失后，诸神决定他们已经受够了。Aether Kindred是对他们力量的一种积极威胁。诸神担心，有一天他们所建立的一切都会被剥夺。他们需要现在就出手，趁着他们还有信徒的信仰，站在他们力量的巅峰。",
	"Thus, all the gods, good and evil alike, banded together as a host and launched an assault on the Kindred. This became known as the Aetheric War.": "因此，所有的神灵，不论是善的还是恶的，都联合起来，作为东道主，对金德人发起了攻击。这场战争被称为 \"太虚战争\"。",
	"None can say precisely what happened to the gods who participated in the war. Some historians say it was a slaughter. Others believe the gods were consumed by the eldritch horrors they tried to defeat. Others state that some gods retreated from this plane to someplace the Kindred could not reach them. While nothing is certain about what happened to the gods thereafter, it is quite certain they were utterly defeated.": "没有人能够准确地说出参加战争的神灵们发生了什么。一些历史学家说这是一场大屠杀。另一些人认为，诸神被他们试图打败的长生恐怖所吞噬。还有人说，一些神明从这个平面撤退到金德人无法到达的地方。虽然不能确定此后诸神发生了什么，但可以肯定的是他们被彻底打败了。",
	"Of the great pantheon, only the four youngest survived: Galt the Builder, Maligant Warclad, Ulmyr the Wise, and Aurelia of the Hearth. Perhaps out of caution or fear, they held back from the Aetheric War. Thus, they were the only ones left to pick up the pieces, becoming responsible for the fostering of Etharis's future.": "在伟大的万神殿中，只有最年轻的四个人幸存下来。建设者高特（Galt the Builder）、马利根（Maligant Warclad）、智慧者乌尔米尔（Ulmyr the Wise）和壁炉的奥蕾莉亚（Aurelia of the Hearth）。也许是出于谨慎或恐惧，他们在乙太战争中按兵不动。因此，他们是唯一留下来收拾残局的人，成为培养Etharis的未来的责任。",
	"If there was any silver lining to the Aetheric War, it was that the Kindred never showed themselves afterward. It's believed these horrors slept deeply after destroying so many of the gods, perhaps requiring rest to heal from their wounds. But once they have regenerated, they will likely take revenge on the rest of the gods' creations.": "如果说乙太战争有任何一线希望的话，那就是金德人后来从未露面。人们相信，在摧毁了这么多神灵之后，这些恐怖的人睡得很沉，也许需要休息来治愈他们的伤口。但一旦他们再生，他们很可能会对其余的神的创造物进行报复。",
	"Whatever the reason, this left the Four Divines to their own devices. As the surviving gods left to guide the mortals of Etharis, they decided to band together. Their idea was to create an ideal empire, the \"one above all\" to act as a shining beacon for all mortals to emulate. This idea became the Bürach Empire. Its first emperor, Indorius I, would be the lightbringer for all the nations of Etharis. To this end, the Four Divines gifted him with four holy artifacts that would enable him to rule wisely and protect his empire.": "不管是什么原因，这让四神族只能靠自己的力量。当幸存的诸神离开指导伊萨利斯的凡人时，他们决定联合起来。他们的想法是建立一个理想的帝国，\"高于一切 \"的帝国，作为所有凡人效仿的闪亮灯塔。这个想法成为布拉克帝国。它的第一任皇帝，因多里乌斯一世，将成为伊萨里斯所有国家的照明灯。为此，四位神人向他赠送了四件神圣的神器，使他能够明智地统治和保护他的帝国。",
	"For a time, all was good. Unfortunately, this method of salvation carried the seeds of its own destruction. The Bürach Empire so loved their emperor that they decided to keep his bloodline eternally pure. The Church of the Hearthkeepers imposed the Edict of Eternal Blood, mandating that only those of the line of Indorius I may ascend to the throne. With that, they forced his descendants to intermarry, weakening their blood. The wretched outcome of this practice finally manifested in the Mad Emperor, Leopold.": "有一段时间，一切都很好。不幸的是，这种救赎方法带来了自身毁灭的种子。布拉赫帝国如此热爱他们的皇帝，以至于他们决定让他的血统永远保持纯净。守炉人教会颁布了《永恒血统法令》，规定只有因多里乌斯一世的血统才能登上王位。就这样，他们强迫他的后代通婚，削弱了他们的血统。这种做法的悲惨结果最终体现在疯狂皇帝利奥波德身上。",
	"When Leopold touched the divine artifacts, his mind and soul were instantly connected with the Four Divines—and it drove them all to madness. Galt, Malignant, Ulmyr, and Aurelia warred among themselves, each vying to reign as the One True God of the universe. This culminated in the Gods' End, when these last remaining deities destroyed one another.": "当利奥波德接触到神器时，他的思想和灵魂立即与四位神人相连--这使他们都陷入了疯狂。高尔基、马利尼特、乌尔米尔和奥蕾莉亚相互争斗，各自争夺宇宙唯一真神的地位。这在诸神的终结中达到了顶点，当时这些最后剩下的神祗互相毁灭。",
	"Etharis carries on as a godless world. While divine power remains, it constitutes but a shadow of its former glory.": "伊萨里斯作为一个无神的世界继续存在。虽然神的力量仍然存在，但它只是以前荣耀的一个影子。",
	"In the absence of the gods, Arch Seraphs and Arch Daemons took up their mantle. While these beings are lesser divinities, they inherited part of their deity's power, making them the source of divine magic in Etharis.": "在诸神缺席的情况下，大蛇夫和大魔王接过他们的衣钵。虽然这些生命是较小的神灵，但他们继承了他们神灵的部分力量，使他们成为伊萨里斯的神术之源。",
	"The Arch Seraphs each correspond to a virtue.": "大蛇夫们各自对应着一种美德。",
	"The Arch Seraph of Valor is the former servant of the war god Maligant. A favorite of holy warriors, he is the patron of courage and strength, as well as all who seek to wage a righteous war. Due to his uncompromising nature, his followers tend to become zealots in the pursuit of righteousness. Empyreus is traditionally opposed by the Lord of Fear, Beleth. Although of late, Beleth seems to have gotten the better of him, as some of Empyreus's followers have tended to use terror to enforce their beliefs.": "英勇的大蛇夫是战神马利根的前仆人。他是圣战者的最爱，是勇气和力量的守护神，也是所有寻求发动正义战争的人的守护神。由于他不妥协的本性，他的追随者往往成为追求正义的狂热分子。恩庇留斯传统上是由恐惧之主贝勒思反对的。尽管最近，贝勒思似乎对他有了更多的了解，因为帝释天的一些追随者倾向于使用恐怖手段来推行他们的信仰。",
	"The Arch Seraph of Truth was once the librarian of the goddess Typharia. Zabriel abandoned his mistress's neutral stance and instead sought to bring an end to the lies that support tyrants and oppressors. He is loved by scholars and truth seekers, and he is opposed directly by Venin, the Great Deceiver.": "真理大蛇神曾经是泰法利亚女神的图书管理员。扎布瑞尔放弃了他女主人的中立立场，转而寻求结束那些支持暴君和压迫者的谎言。他受到学者和真理追求者的爱戴，他直接受到大欺骗者维宁的反对。",
	"The Arch Seraph of Temperance holds sway over the domains of peace and spirituality. A patron of monks, clerics, and peacemakers, Aphaelon is honored by those who seek enlightenment. Once a servant of Myria, goddess of joy, he has since decided there is little joy to be found in Etharis, and he has therefore taken to becoming the saint of those who seek spiritual balance. Those who follow his ways find freedom from addictions and worldly desires. He is opposed by the Arch Daemon of Hedonism, Sitri.": "节制大蛇神掌管着和平和精神领域的事务。作为僧侣、教士和和平缔造者的守护神，Aphaelon受到了那些寻求启蒙的人的尊敬。他曾经是快乐女神Myria的仆人，后来他认为在Etharis没有什么快乐可言，因此他开始成为那些寻求精神平衡的人的圣徒。那些追随他的人可以从毒瘾和世俗的欲望中获得自由。他的对手是享乐主义的大魔王，西特里。",
	"The Arch Seraph of Justice, she has remained faithful to the ways of her former master and seeks to destroy the Aether Kindred who killed him. She is the patron of good judges, vigilantes, and hunters of eldritch abominations. She often foils the schemes of Gorodyn, the Daemon of Avarice.": "正义的大蛇神，她一直忠于她前主人的方式，并试图摧毁杀害他的乙太族。她是善良的法官、守夜人和长生不老的猎手的守护者。她经常挫败贪婪大魔王戈罗丁的阴谋。",
	"While she is known as the Great Judge, Solyma has gained another epitaph from her worshippers in Ostoya: Lady Vengeance. The bloodiest family vendettas have thus been waged in her name.": "虽然她被称为大法官，但索里玛从她在奥斯托亚的崇拜者那里获得了另一个墓志铭。复仇女士。因此，最血腥的家族仇杀都是以她的名义进行的。",
	"The Arch Seraph of Sacrifice holds power over the domains of Heroism and Compassion. Unlike the other archangels, he is actually an aspect of his former mistress Vetara, the goddess of love. He is the patron of martyrs and those who aspire to be great heroes. He represents hope for a better tomorrow that comes by making sacrifices, both great and small. He offers strength to those who must surrender themselves for a great cause. He is opposed by Malikir the Proud.": "牺牲的大天使拥有对英雄主义和同情心领域的权力。与其他大天使不同，他实际上是他以前的女主人维塔拉的一个方面，即爱神。他是烈士和那些渴望成为伟大英雄的人的守护者。他代表着对美好明天的希望，这种希望来自于巨大和微小的牺牲。他为那些必须为伟大事业献身的人提供力量。他的对手是 \"骄傲的马利基尔\"。",
	"The Arch Seraph of Mercy, her domain is healing and freedom from suffering. She does not have the power of Aurelia, goddess of protection; she can only offer aid to those already sick, wounded, or in distress. It is said that this new dark age offers no rest for Miklas the Merciful. She is opposed by Tormach, the new Lord of War.": "慈悲的大蛇夫，她的领域是治疗和摆脱痛苦。她没有保护女神奥蕾莉亚的能力；她只能向那些已经生病、受伤或处于困境的人提供援助。据说这个新的黑暗时代没有给仁慈的米克拉斯带来休息。她的对手是新的战争之王托马斯（Tormach）。",
	"The Arch Daemons each correspond to the cardinal sins. None have remained faithful to their erstwhile masters.": "大魔王们各自对应着主要的罪孽。没有人对他们以前的主人保持忠诚。",
	"The Arch Daemon of Fear goes by other names: the Trickster, the Laughing Man, and Blackjester. Beleth's goal is to spread fear throughout the world, and in this regard he has far surpassed his former master. Beleth derives pleasure from torturing mortals with their worst fears. He's the patron of tyrants and oppressors everywhere, but Beleth's cruel practical joke is that every one of these people end up fearing the very people they oppress. To him, it's eternally funny.": "恐惧大魔王还有其他名字：捣蛋鬼、笑面人和黑色小丑。贝勒思的目标是在全世界传播恐惧，在这方面他已经远远超过了他的前主人。贝勒思从用凡人最恐惧的东西折磨他们中获得快乐。他是各地暴君和压迫者的守护者，但贝勒思残酷的实际玩笑是，这些人中的每一个人最终都会害怕他们所压迫的人。对他来说，这是个永恒的笑话。",
	"Beleth has no fear of Empyreus, and any who mentions the Arch Seraphs causes Blackjester to smirk, as if from a private joke.": "Beleth不惧怕Empyreus，任何提到Arch Seraphs的人都会引起Blackjester的冷笑，仿佛来自一个私人笑话。",
	"The Arch Daemon of Deceit is known as the Great Deceiver, Dusktongue, and Hooded. She is the master of illusion, lies, and insanity. Venin is capable of giving her followers power over illusions and deceit, but eventually even they lose track of what is truth and fiction. Venin hates Zabriel and rewards those who assassinate the Arch Seraph's followers.": "欺骗的大魔王被称为大欺骗者，Dusktongue，以及蒙面人。她是幻觉、谎言和精神错乱的大师。维宁有能力给她的追随者以战胜幻觉和欺骗的力量，但最终连他们也会失去对什么是真理和虚构的追踪。维宁憎恨扎布瑞尔，并奖励那些刺杀大蛇夫的追随者。",
	"The Arch Daemon of Hedonism, who is also called Bloodrose and the Tempter, lures mortals to give in to gluttony, lust, and the basest worldly desires. Those who follow Sitri eventually lose themselves to their addictions. Sitri's most prized possessions are the souls of Aphaelon's followers who backslide into their desires. Sitri enjoys taunting the Arch Seraph with these mortals the most.": "享乐主义的大魔王，也被称为 \"血玫瑰 \"和 \"诱惑者\"，他引诱凡人向贪食、淫欲和最卑微的世俗欲望屈服。那些追随西特里的人最终会因为他们的嗜好而失去自我。西特里最珍贵的财产是阿菲隆的追随者的灵魂，这些追随者倒向他们的欲望。西特里最喜欢用这些凡人来嘲弄大蛇夫。",
	"The Arch Daemon of Avarice is often called the King of Red Coins. He's a corrupted follower of Jezra, god of commerce. In his boundless treasury, he counts the souls of those who have given themselves to hoarding wealth by whatever means necessary, leaving hunger and poverty for the rest of the world.": "贪婪的大魔王通常被称为红币之王。他是商业之神杰兹拉的堕落追随者。在他无尽的宝库中，他计算着那些不择手段地囤积财富的人的灵魂，把饥饿和贫穷留给了世界上的其他人。",
	"Gorodyn fears Solyma, as he owns so much there is very little he can do to defend it all. He has taken to bribing mortals and other beings to fight her in his stead.": "戈罗丁害怕索里玛，因为他拥有的东西太多，他几乎无法保卫这一切。他已经采取了贿赂凡人和其他生命的方式来代替他与她作战。",
	"The Arch Daemon of Pride prefers the title \"God\". As the most powerful of the Arch Daemons, her domain is tyranny and the abuse of authority. She is known to corrupt heroes who start out as goodhearted but eventually give in to pride. Inevitably, her followers meet a terrible fall.": "骄傲的大魔王更喜欢 \"神 \"这个称号。作为大恶魔中最强大的一个，她的领域是暴政和滥用权力。众所周知，她会腐蚀那些一开始心地善良但最终向骄傲屈服的英雄。不可避免地，她的追随者会遭遇可怕的堕落。",
	"Malikir considers her counterpart, Morael, as a weakling and not even worth mentioning.": "马利基尔认为她的同行莫拉尔是个弱者，甚至不值得一提。",
	"The Arch Daemon of Wrath goes by names such as Manslayer and Marauder, as he has taken over the domain of the war god Maligant. He is a patron and source of strength for evil-aligned warriors. Unfortunately, he cannot offer strategy or wisdom, only mindless butchery and violence. For Tormach, winning comes second to dealing as much suffering and death as possible. Privately, even the other Arch Daemons consider him the weakest of their number.": "愤怒的大魔王有很多名字，比如屠夫（Manslayer）和掠夺者（Marauder），因为他已经接管了战神马利根特的领域。他是邪恶联盟战士的守护者和力量之源。不幸的是，他不能提供战略或智慧，只能提供无意识的杀戮和暴力。对托尔马赫来说，胜利是第二位的，要尽可能多地制造痛苦和死亡。私下里，甚至其他大魔王也认为他是他们中最弱的。",
	"Though he has tried time and again, Tormach has failed to defeat Miklas the Redeemer, a fact that infuriates him to no end.": "虽然他一次又一次地尝试，但托马斯却没能打败救世主米克拉斯，这一事实让他愤怒不已。",
	"The gods' presence has waned. Divine power is rare in Etharis. As a cleric or a paladin, you are a rarity, and your patron calls upon you to project their power into this world.": "诸神的存在已经减弱了。神圣的力量在Etharis是罕见的。作为一个牧师或圣骑士，你是一个稀有的人，你的守护者呼吁你将他们的力量投射到这个世界。",
	"Remember that Etharis has entered into a Dark Age, the likes of which has never been experienced. Its people are starved for guidance and want to believe in a power greater than themselves. As a wielder of divine magic, you may use that hunger to bring hope and light to the world, or you could twist it to your advantage. Rarity is a form of power, after all.": "请记住，Etharis已经进入了一个黑暗时代，这是从来没有过的。它的人民渴望得到指导，想要相信一种比他们自己更强大的力量。作为一个神圣魔法的施展者，你可以利用这种饥渴给世界带来希望和光明，也可以将它扭曲成你的优势。稀有性毕竟是权力的一种形式。",
	"In the beginning, when the gods created the world, they had no idea of the power they would imbue into it: it was, after all, their first attempt at creation. Thus they imparted too much of their power into the substances they made and accidentally breathed life into. This act is how the Primordials came to be.": "起初，当众神创造世界时，他们不知道他们将赋予世界的力量：毕竟，这是他们第一次尝试创造。因此，他们把自己的力量过多地灌输给他们制造的物质，并意外地注入了生命。这种行为就是原始人的出现。",
	"Chief of the Primordials is a being known as Gormadraug, a tiny being that carried a spark of the gods' divinity. Gormadrag amused the gods so they kept it as a pet. Over time, their treatment became abusive, using Gormadraug for hunting sport, slaying and resurrecting him over and over. Finally, when they tired of him, they abandoned him on the newly formed Etharis.": "原始人的首领是一个被称为戈马德拉格的生物，一个带着众神神性火花的小生命。戈马德拉格逗乐了众神，所以他们把它当作宠物来养。随着时间的推移，他们的待遇变得粗暴起来，利用戈马德拉克进行狩猎运动，一次又一次地杀戮和复活他。最后，当他们厌倦了它，就把它遗弃在新形成的伊萨里斯。",
	"For millennia, Gormadraug devoured everything he could see: rocks, ice, lava, and air. With every century, he grew larger, until finally, he emerged as a colossal Wyrm with power over all the elements. So powerful was he that could spawn his own children, themselves powerful Primordials.": "几千年来，戈马德鲁格吞噬了他能看到的一切：岩石、冰、熔岩和空气。每过一个世纪，他都会变大，直到最后，他成为一个巨大的巫妖，拥有控制所有元素的力量。他是如此强大，以至于可以产生自己的孩子，他们是强大的原始人。",
	"However, he never forgot his treatment at the hands of the gods. He nursed his hatred for a millennia. The final straw was when the gods declared that the new race of mortals would inherit all of Etharis. Gormadraug sought his revenge by sending his Primordials to war against the gods.": "然而，他从未忘记自己在众神手中的待遇。他的仇恨持续了一千年。最后一根稻草是当诸神宣布新的凡人种族将继承所有的伊萨利斯。戈马德鲁格为了复仇，派他的原始人去与诸神作战。",
	"Despite his numerous spawn, they were not powerful or plentiful enough to achieve his goal. The gods handily defeated the Primordials. Gormadraug survived, however, and went into hiding.": "尽管他的卵子很多，但它们的力量和数量都不足以实现他的目标。诸神轻松地击败了原始人。然而，戈马德鲁格幸存下来，并躲藏了起来。",
	"This setback did have one upside for the Great Wyrm: it emboldened the gods to believe they could fight the Aether Kindred as well. The debacle that followed left Etharis with only four remaining gods.": "这次挫折对大巫妖来说确实有一个好处：它使众神相信他们也能与乙太族作战。随后的失败使伊萨里斯只剩下四个神灵。",
	"Gormadraug wasted no time: he created four new spawn that he would use to fight a new war on the gods and their mortal children. These Primordials were Alondo of the Deep, Morrakesh the Burning Lady, Citrolach the Living Mountain, and Ilhara the Queen of Air and Shadow.": "戈马德拉格没有浪费时间：他创造了四个新的卵子，他将用它们来对诸神和他们的凡人子女进行新的战争。这些原始人是深渊的阿隆多、燃烧的女士莫拉凯什、活山的希特罗拉和空气与阴影的女王伊尔哈拉。",
	"This time, Gormadraug aimed to win. He became as cruel to his children as the gods were to him. To strengthen them, he forced them to compete with each other endlessly, killing each other in an arena of death and resurrection.": "这一次，戈马德鲁格的目标是赢。他对他的孩子们变得像诸神对他一样残酷。为了加强他们，他强迫他们无休止地相互竞争，在死亡和复活的竞技场上相互残杀。",
	"The four Primordials endured centuries of this treatment, each one aching to be free of their sire. They found their opportunity from an unexpected source: a man named Kentigern and his six companions, seeking to tame the northern wilderness for habitation.": "四个原始人忍受了几个世纪的这种待遇，每个人都渴望从他们的父亲那里获得自由。他们从一个意想不到的地方找到了机会：一个叫肯特根的人和他的六个同伴，试图驯服北方的荒野，以便居住。",
	"Alondo convinced his siblings to betray their sire and take the adventurers under their wing. Morrakesh and Citrolach formed powerful magic weapons that could pierce Gormadraug's flesh. Ilhara composed for them a magic song that would put the Wyrm to sleep. Alondo taught them enchantments that would keep them alive, and he also told them where to strike Gormadraug's heart.": "阿隆多说服他的兄弟姐妹们背叛了他们的陛下，把冒险家们收归麾下。莫拉凯什和希特罗拉赫形成了强大的魔法武器，可以刺穿戈马德拉克的肉体。伊尔哈拉为他们谱写了一首能让巫妖沉睡的魔法歌曲。阿隆多向他们传授了能让他们活下去的魔法，他还告诉他们在哪里可以打击戈马德鲁格的心脏。",
	"Thus, Kentigern and his companions were able to slay Gormadraug. His body was destroyed, save for his indestructible heart, which was thrown into the northern sea and formed an island. Subsequently, the four Primordials divided Etharis among themselves and formed their own realms. Citrolach and Morrakesh settled along the equator, while Alondo and Ilhara resided closer to the poles.": "因此，肯特根和他的同伴们得以杀死戈马德劳格。他的身体被摧毁了，只有他那颗坚不可摧的心脏，被扔进了北海，形成了一个岛屿。随后，四个原始人将伊萨里斯分给他们自己，并形成了自己的王国。希特罗拉赫和莫拉凯什沿着赤道定居，而阿隆多和伊尔哈拉则居住在更靠近两极的地方。",
	"Yet all four Primordials know that their sire had not truly perished, but merely slumbered in a state of hibernation. Even now, mortals obtain command over the elements from the Prismatic Wyrm. The day may come when Gormadraug would awaken and wreak his vengeance across Etharis. They continually seek ways to prevent this from happening. Yet with the appearance of coldfire, it seems the Prismatic Wyrm's resurrection is coming ever closer.": "然而，所有四个原始人都知道，他们的祖先并没有真正消亡，而只是在冬眠状态下沉睡。即使现在，凡人也能从棱镜巫妖那里获得对各种元素的控制权。有一天，戈马德鲁格可能会苏醒过来，并在整个伊萨里斯展开复仇行动。他们不断地寻找方法来防止这种情况发生。然而，随着冷火的出现，似乎棱镜巫妖的复活越来越近了。",
	"The Burning Lady, Red Queen, and Emberheart are among her many names. The Primordial of fire holds court in her dimension of Flamebourne. She commands azers, efreeti, and fire giants in her army.": "燃烧的女士、红皇后和微光之心是她的众多名字之一。火之始祖在她的空间--火焰之城--举行法庭。她在她的军队中指挥着阿泽尔人、埃弗里蒂人和火巨人。",
	"Morrakesh suffered the worst under Gormadraug, as the Wyrm saw her as his most destructive weapon. As such she is highly capricious and easy to anger; she may reward you with great riches as easily as she can turn you into a cinder. Great care must be taken in petitioning her.": "莫拉凯什在戈玛德劳格的统治下遭受了最严重的伤害，因为巫妖将她视为他最具破坏性的武器。因此，她非常反复无常，很容易被激怒；她可能会给你带来巨大的财富，也可能会轻易把你变成焦炭。在向她请愿时必须非常小心。",
	"Those who would summon Morrakesh for favors must first burn a sentient being alive as a sacrifice.": "那些想召唤莫拉凯什帮忙的人必须先把一个有生命的人活活烧死作为祭品。",
	"Lord of the Deep and ruler of the Endless Sea, Alondo controls the denizens of lakes and seas. He is worshipped by merfolk, water elementals, and the mighty leviathans.": "深海之主和无尽之海的统治者，阿隆多控制着湖泊和海洋的居民。他受到人鱼族、水元素和强大的利维坦族的崇拜。",
	"Aside from Kentigern, Alondo has no love for mortals and wishes to be left alone. That said, he is the most conscientious of his ilk, working diligently to prevent the return of Gormadraug. Still, rumours persist that he has something to do with the outbreak of coldfire plaguing Etharis.": "除了肯蒂根之外，阿隆多对凡人没有爱，他希望能够独处。尽管如此，他是他的同类中最认真的一个，努力工作以防止戈马德拉克的回归。尽管如此，仍有传言说他与困扰伊萨里斯的冷火爆发有关。",
	"Those who would invoke Alondo must first slay one of his hated enemies and hurl its heart into the sea.": "召唤阿隆多的人必须先杀死他的一个仇人，并将其心脏扔进大海。",
	"The Living Mountain masters over all those who pledge themselves to earth and stone: earth elementals, deep dwarves, and gnomes, as well as all who dwell in his underground realm of Stonereach. His power extends to plants and the denizens of the forests.": "活山主宰着所有以土和石为誓的人：土元素、深层矮人和地精，以及所有居住在他的地下王国石器时代的人。他的力量还延伸到植物和森林的居民。",
	"To summon Citrolach, one must surrender a fortune in gems and gold, all of which is returned by the Primordial to the ground from where it was taken. Take care, however. Notoriously stubborn, Citrolach holds to a particular stand for centuries. The saying goes that it is easier to move a mountain than convince Citrolach to change his mind.": "要召唤希特拉赫，必须交出一笔宝石和黄金的财富，所有这些都会被原始人送回地面。然而，请注意。西特罗拉赫是出了名的顽固，他坚持一个特定的立场达几个世纪之久。俗话说，移动一座山比说服西特罗拉赫改变主意更容易。",
	"The Queen of Air and Shadow is the most ambitious Primordial of all. She sends her army of djinn, sylphs, and air elementals abroad to find secrets from among mortals and spirits alike. Her ultimate aim is to be powerful enough to fill the void left by the dead gods.": "空气和阴影女王是所有原始人中最有野心的。她将她的精灵、女巫和空气元素的军队派往国外，从凡人和灵魂中寻找秘密。她的最终目标是要强大到足以填补死去的诸神留下的空白。",
	"Ilhara requires that a dark secret be whispered into the air before she can be summoned.": "伊尔哈拉要求在召唤她之前，必须在空气中低声说出一个黑暗的秘密。",
	"The Great Prismatic Wyrm is also a powerful source of nature magic, though he doesn't know this in his current state. There is no known way to invoke him. Moreover, worship of the Wyrm is illegal throughout the Valikan Clans. The Primordials also warn that drawing power from Gormadraug may even awaken him, and readily smites any druids or rangers who try.": "大棱镜巫妖也是一个强大的自然魔法来源，尽管他在目前的状态下并不知道这一点。没有已知的方法可以召唤他。此外，对巫妖的崇拜在整个瓦里肯氏族都是非法的。原始人还警告说，从戈马德鲁格身上汲取力量甚至可能唤醒他，并随时会打击任何尝试的德鲁伊或游侠。",
	"There are three important centers in Etharis for learning nature magic: the druid circles of the Valikan Clans, the Order of the Golden Bough in Eastern Nordenland, and the elves of Tol Leyemil. These are not the only places for learning, but druids and rangers that emerge from here are considered to be among the elite.": "在Etharis有三个重要的自然魔法学习中心：瓦利坎氏族的德鲁伊圈子、东诺登兰的金枝会和托尔-莱伊米尔的精灵。这些并不是唯一的学习场所，但从这里走出的德鲁伊和游侠被认为是精英中的精英。",
	"your power is derived from the Primordials—including Gormadraug. These beings have taken over the realm of gods in terms of nature magic. They each serve their own interests and are not bound by mortal notions of good and evil. They are, however, hostile to all that threatens that power. This includes the possible awakening of Gormadraug, the corruption of nature caused by the Dark Mist, and the arrival of the Great Beast. The Primordials require druids and rangers alike to fight these forces wherever they encounter them.": "你的力量来自于原始人--包括戈马德拉格。这些生命在自然魔法方面已经占据了诸神的领域。他们各自为自己的利益服务，不受凡人的善恶观念约束。然而，他们对所有威胁到这种力量的东西都充满敌意。这包括戈玛德鲁格可能的觉醒、黑暗之雾造成的自然腐败以及巨兽的到来。原始人要求德鲁伊和游侠们在遇到这些力量时都要与之斗争。",

Characters in the world of Etharis are influenced by dark and sometimes malevolent powers, delving into areas others might avoid.": "冒险家们根据他们训练和前进的文化，在他们的能力和观点上有所专攻。Etharis世界中的人物受到黑暗的、有时是邪恶的力量的影响，深入到其他人可能避免的领域。",
	"The subclasses here reflect back onto the heroes the world in which they live and fight. Some absorb into themselves the dangerous but powerful forces they fight.

	"He reached for brother's helm to take one last look, but the longsword sprang from Laszlo's hand. Mischa shrieked as the blade sizzled through the air, cutting through the phylactery around his neck and plunging deep into his chest.": "他伸手去拿哥哥的头盔，想看最后一眼，但长剑从拉斯洛的手中飞出。米沙尖叫着，剑身在空中划过，划破了他脖子上的护身符，深深地刺入他的胸膛。",
	"He collapsed to the ground next to Laszlo's body form. Gasping, feeling his life drain away, he reached out for his brother's hand.": "他倒在地上，紧挨着拉斯洛的身形。他喘着粗气，感觉自己的生命在流逝，他伸出手去抓他哥哥的手。",

	"\"Magic?\" Laszlo looked at him quizzically. \"Why magic?\"": "\"魔法？\" 拉斯洛疑惑地看着他。\"为什么是魔法？\"",

	"While transformations make for great roleplay opportunities, at no point do they provide an acceptable excuse to hurt the enjoyment of other players at the table. If you want to create a conflict between two player characters, it's imperative that you discuss this with the table (and particularly your GM) first.": "虽然变身是一个很好的角色扮演机会，但在任何时候都不能成为伤害同桌其他玩家乐趣的可接受借口。如果你想在两个玩家角色之间制造冲突，你必须先与同桌（尤其是你的GM）讨论这个问题。",
	"Individuals rarely choose to transform into beings of the night. Instead, they have it forced upon them. Foul curses, horrific experiments, and the diabolical machinations of fiends, vampires, and other dark agents are all examples of how a character might start a transformation. However, there are times when a character may wish to begin a transformation of their own volition. Perhaps they have succumbed to the lure of power, or they see it as the only way to achieve a greater goal.": "个人很少选择转化为夜的生命。相反，他们是被迫变成的。恶毒的诅咒、可怕的实验、恶魔、吸血鬼和其他黑暗势力的邪恶阴谋，都是一个角色可能开始转变的例子。然而，有些时候，一个角色可能希望按照自己的意愿开始转变。也许他们已经屈服于权力的诱惑，或者他们认为这是实现更大目标的唯一途径。",
	"Regardless, the first step in any transformation should be a discussion with your GM. Make your intentions clear, as the transformation may not be suitable for the setting or story your GM is running.": "无论如何，任何转变的第一步应该是与你的GM讨论。明确你的意图，因为这种转变可能不适合你的GM所经营的环境或故事。",
	"The next step in a transformation is to ensure you meet all the prerequisites of the transformation. There are 2 types of prerequisites: mechanical and roleplay prerequisites. Mechanical prerequisites can be ability score, spellcasting, and other feature requirements. Roleplay prerequisites are the in-game actions required by a character to start a transformation. It is recommended that this milestone be reached within the game rather than through a backstory. However, you may wish to discuss alternative avenues to pursue a prerequisite with your GM.": "改造的下一步是确保你满足改造的所有先决条件。有2种类型的先决条件：机械先决条件和角色扮演先决条件。机械先决条件可以是能力分数、法术和其他特征要求。角色扮演的先决条件是角色在游戏中的行动要求，以开始转变。建议在游戏中达到这一里程碑，而不是通过背景故事。然而，你可能希望与你的GM讨论追求先决条件的其他途径。",
	"Within the dark fantasy world of Etharis, Transformations are representative of the gothic and body horror elements of the world. As a result, they should increase a character in power but ultimately be rooted in tragedy, as the setting demands. However, if you are not playing in a dark fantasy setting or you want your Transformation to feel more like a blessing than a curse, discuss with your GM the possibility of removing some or all the flaws associated with your Transformation. Alternatively, feel free to tinker with the boons and flaws with your GM. Transformations should suit the needs of your campaign, not the other way around.": "在Etharis的黑暗幻想世界中，变身是这个世界中哥特式和身体恐怖元素的代表。因此，它们应该增加角色的力量，但最终要以悲剧为根基，这是该设定的要求。然而，如果你不是在黑暗幻想的环境中游戏，或者你希望你的变身更像是一种祝福而不是诅咒，请与你的GM讨论是否有可能去除与你的变身相关的一些或所有的缺陷。另外，你也可以和你的GM一起修改这些优点和缺点。变身应该适合你的活动的需要，而不是相反。",
	"When you have achieved all the required prerequisites of a transformation and reached your first transformation level, you gain all the boons and the flaw of the first level. These constitute the beginning of the changes from the transformation. The boons and flaws of these iconic monsters come from folklore, pop culture, and our own imagination. If they differ from an existing trope or stat block, it is because they represent a variation unique to Etharis.": "当你达到了转型所需的所有先决条件并达到了你的第一个转型等级，你就获得了所有的好处和第一个等级的缺陷。这些构成了变身后变化的开始。这些标志性怪物的优点和缺点来自民间传说、流行文化和我们自己的想象力。如果它们与现有的特例或状态块不同，那是因为它们代表了Etharis特有的变化。",
	"Characters that have successfully completed a transformation can continue the process by increasing their transformation level. The character must achieve a milestone before gaining a transformation level. Each type of transformation has an example list of possible milestones that are thematically unique. Talk with your GM to come up with applicable milestones for your campaign and how you can achieve them.": "已经成功完成变身的角色可以通过提高变身等级来继续这个过程。角色在获得变身等级之前必须达到一个里程碑。每种类型的转变都有一个可能的里程碑的例子列表，其主题是独特的。与你的GM商量一下，为你的活动提出适用的里程碑以及如何实现它们。",

Transformations such as the Lich are much more powerful and should only be available at higher levels of play.": "虽然变身是里程碑式的成就，每一级都有缺陷，但变身仍然代表着力量的显著增加。出于这个原因，我们建议玩家和GM使用下面的等级表作为指导，以确定玩家何时能够提升变身的等级。毕竟，只有最强的人才能在这样的磨难中生存下来。然而，这个表格只是一个指南，并不能同样适用于所有变身。像 \"巫师 \"这样的变身是非常强大的，只有在更高的游戏水平下才能使用。",

	"Rather than casting {@spell remove curse} with the cure components, the {@spell regenerate} spell must be cast with the cure components instead.

	"The biggest fears for an explorer are constraint and oppression, but missing out and failing to live a full life isn't far behind. Explorers might be spiritual seekers, literal wanderers, or something in between. Whatever the case, to an explorer, the journey is the goal, which can lead some to aimlessness or nonconformity encouraged by the journeying spirit.": "对探险家来说，最大的恐惧是约束和压迫，但错失良机和未能过上充实的生活也不在其次。探索者可能是精神上的追求者，字面上的流浪者，或介于两者之间。不管是什么情况，对探索者来说，旅程就是目标，这可能会导致一些人在旅行精神的鼓励下出现漫无目的或不守规矩的情况。",
	"Knowledge is a realm of exploration, and the philosopher is an explorer of that space. That's not to say a philosopher is always to be found reading or experimenting. These sagely types also seek truth, and finding the truth can mean going out into the world and risking your neck. A mystery intrigues a philosopher, whose greatest hope is to see through the illusions of life. But a philosopher can fall hard in their exploration of consciousness, such as to mind-altering substances. Philosophers can also be removed from the real world, becoming aloof, critical, dogmatic, or even cruel.": "知识是一个探索的领域，而哲学家是这个空间的探索者。这并不是说哲学家总是在阅读或实验中被发现。这些有智慧的人也在寻求真理，而寻找真理可能意味着到外面的世界去，冒着危险。一个神秘的东西让哲学家感到好奇，他最大的希望是看穿生活的幻觉。但一个哲学家在探索意识的过程中可能会摔得很惨，比如对改变心智的物质。哲学家也可能脱离现实世界，变得冷漠、挑剔、教条，甚至残忍。",

	"Falling in this way can occur due to a desire to leave a mark or meet a goal. But just as often, a person falls due to a personal flaw, such as hedonism, greed, or wrath. Malevolent forces might exploit a virtue, such as filial loyalty to a crime family, to cause someone to fall. The valorous willingly face evil, but one who fights monsters must take care not to become one.": "以这种方式堕落可能是由于渴望留下痕迹或达到目标而发生的。但同样常见的是，一个人因个人缺陷而堕落，如享乐主义、贪婪或愤怒。邪恶的力量可能会利用一种美德，如对犯罪家族的孝顺，导致某人堕落。勇敢的人愿意面对邪恶，但与怪物战斗的人必须注意不要成为怪物。",
	"A character can start out fallen, never to claw their way back from that gloomy start. Others fall but rise again. Redemption is a heroic arc, a spiritual journey during which a character atones for past wrongs. This path entails intention and sacrifice. Few truly redeem themselves with a great deed done at death's door.": "一个角色可以从一开始就堕落，永远不会从那个阴暗的开始中挣扎回来。也有的人倒下了，但又重新站起来。救赎是一个英雄的弧线，是一个精神的旅程，在这个过程中，一个角色为过去的错误进行补偿。这条路需要用心和牺牲。很少有人真正通过在死亡之门前的伟大行为来赎回自己。",

	"Insatiable. I can't get enough of anything. More!": "贪得无厌。我对任何东西都欲罢不能。更多!",
	"Pessimist. Loss, failure... evil. It's all inevitable. Why fight it?": "悲观主义者。损失、失败......邪恶。这都是不可避免的。为什么要与之斗争？",
	"Secret. I have done things vile enough that others would reject me if they knew.": "秘密。我曾做过一些卑鄙的事情，如果别人知道，会拒绝我。",
	"A giver seeks to give order to the world through personal investment. At a basic level, givers are \"treat others as you want to be treated\" types. They genuinely want to help others. Some givers achieve this goal through direct altruism, compassion, and generosity. Others aim to set up structures that support fairness or to tear down systems that enforce imbalances.": "捐赠者寻求通过个人投资给世界带来秩序。在一个基本层面上，捐赠者是 \"以其人之道还治其人之身 \"的类型。他们真诚地想帮助别人。一些捐赠者通过直接的利他主义、同情心和慷慨解囊来实现这一目标。其他人的目标是建立支持公平的结构，或拆毁强制不平衡的系统。",
	"Although givers are motivated by compassion or empathy, they do what they do because of the personal satisfaction it gives. A giver is prone to enable weakness in others, to place too much emphasis on self-sacrifice, to give too much, and to be unable to say no. In a word, martyrdom. Selfishness and ingratitude can catch a giver off guard, leading to bitterness at being exploited. A giver can also be overbearing and paternalistic, expecting their good graces and advice to be heeded and valued.": "尽管施予者的动机是同情心或同理心，但他们所做的事是为了获得个人的满足感。奉献者容易使别人的软弱成为可能，过于强调自我牺牲，付出太多，不能说不。一句话，就是殉道。自私和忘恩负义会让施舍者措手不及，导致被剥削的痛苦。给予者也可能是盛气凌人和家长式的，期望他们的好感和建议被听取和重视。",
	"A creator is the sort of giver who focuses on making something from nothing, order from chaos. The goal is to create ideas and objects of enduring value, raising society to a new level. A creator is an inventor or artist, an imaginer, which can include many mages. Creators fear mediocrity and failure, whether in vision or execution. Therefore, creators overwork and can tend toward perfectionism. A creator can also cling to an idea that has proven faulty, hoping the next experiment will prove the idea right.": "创造者是那种专注于从无到有、从混沌中获得秩序的给予者。其目标是创造具有持久价值的思想和物品，将社会提高到一个新的水平。创造者是一个发明家或艺术家，一个想象者，这可以包括许多法师。创造者害怕平庸和失败，无论是在愿景还是执行方面。因此，创造者会过度工作，并可能倾向于完美主义。创造者也可以坚持一个被证明是错误的想法，希望下一个实验能证明这个想法是正确的。",
	"A leader is one who takes a role of authority to impose the giver's desire for structure on the world from the scale of a family to that of a nation or the world itself. The leader is a giver variant because a real leader must make decisions with the understanding that more than personal values, desires, and property are at stake. Leaders make decisions that affect others and profoundly so. A good leader desires power for noble purposes, but the cliché that power corrupts exists for a reason. Bad leaders see power as an end not a means and do what they can to hold onto authority. Leaders might fear chaos, overemphasize their need for control, and fail to delegate responsibility or authority.": "领导者是一个扮演权威角色的人，将施予者对结构的渴望强加于世界，从家庭的规模到国家或世界本身。领袖是施予者的变体，因为真正的领袖在做决定时，必须明白不仅仅是个人价值、欲望和财产处于危险之中。领袖所做的决定会影响到他人，而且是深远的影响。一个好的领导者为了崇高的目的而渴望权力，但权力使人堕落这一陈词滥调的存在是有原因的。糟糕的领导人将权力视为目的而非手段，并尽其所能掌握权力。领导者可能会害怕混乱，过分强调他们的控制需要，并且不能下放责任或权力。",
	"Givers are common heroic characters who serve well as mentors and sidekicks. As the leader variant shows, givers are also willing to take direct action and point the way for others. Sometimes the giving is by example or through an artistic message, as with the creator. Giver characters include Charlotte A. Cavatica, Samwise Gamgee, Mary Poppins, and Oskar Schindler. Creators include engineers, inventors, and artists such as Dr. Henry Jekyll, Shuri of Wakanda, Naomi Nagata, Tony \"Iron Man\" Stark, and Willy Wonka. Anakin \"Darth Vader\" Skywalker, Calanthe \"the Lioness\" of Cintra, Leia Organa, Miranda Priestly, and Steve \"Captain America\" Rogers exemplify leaders good, bad, or in between.": "奉献者是常见的英雄人物，他们能很好地充当导师和助手的角色。正如领袖变体所显示的，奉献者也愿意采取直接行动，为他人指明方向。有时，给予者是以身作则或通过艺术信息，如创造者。奉献者的角色包括夏洛特-A-卡瓦蒂卡、桑威-甘吉、玛丽-波平斯和奥斯卡-辛德勒。创造者包括工程师、发明家和艺术家，如亨利-杰基尔博士、瓦坎达的舒里、长田直美、\"钢铁侠 \"托尼-斯塔克和威利-旺卡。天行者阿纳金（Anakin \"Darth Vader\" Skywalker）、辛特拉的 \"狮子女 \"卡兰特（Calanthe）、莱娅-奥加纳（Leia Organa）、米兰达-普里斯特利（Miranda Priestly）和史蒂夫-罗杰斯（Steve \"Captain America\" Rogers）则是好的、坏的或介于两者之间的领导者的典范。",
	"A giver focuses on support. Sometimes that's literal, from healing to shoring up weaknesses or reinforcing strengths. Leaders choose capabilities that emphasize their style, whether leading from the front, by example, or with tactical and strategic acumen. Or with an iron hand. Creators support through inspiration and providing other benefits that might be tangible or intangible.": "给予者专注于支持。有时是字面上的，从治疗到支撑弱点或加强优势。领导者选择强调其风格的能力，无论是从正面领导，以身作则，还是以战术和战略的敏锐性。或者用铁的手腕。创造者通过灵感和提供其他可能是有形或无形的利益来支持。",
	"Those of the icon archetype want to be known as a champion or star, someone worthy of remembrance. A person who has the icon archetype might be altruistic and brave, but the root of their behavior is the desire to prove their worth and leave a mark on the world. The simplest such legacy is an enduring reputation, but changing the world for the better (or worse) is another possible goal.": "偶像原型的人希望被称为冠军或明星，是值得纪念的人。具有偶像原型的人可能是利他主义和勇敢的，但他们行为的根源是希望证明自己的价值，并在世界留下痕迹。最简单的这种遗产是一个持久的声誉，但改变世界，使之更好（或更坏）是另一个可能的目标。",
	"The icon archetype is one of personal achievement. An icon seeks skill mastery that allows them to pursue and accomplish goals. Icons are on the lookout for someone to rescue, a worthy cause to support, or a foe to oppose. Some characters fit this archetype but lack virtue. Others are virtuous but, despite believing or desiring otherwise, virtue isn't their primary motive.": "偶像的原型是一种个人成就。偶像寻求技能的掌握，使他们能够追求和完成目标。偶像在寻找可以拯救的人，支持有价值的事业，或反对的敌人。有些人物符合这一原型，但缺乏美德。另一些人有美德，但尽管相信或希望如此，美德并不是他们的主要动机。",
	"The visionary stands between the typical icon and the next variant, the warrior. A visionary wants to change the world while achieving personal mastery, hoping that one feeds into the other and back again. Visionaries seek to know the world (or universe) and pass that understanding to others to create a new state. That desire makes some visionaries noble, but some visionaries want changes no one else does.": "有远见的人站在典型偶像和下一个变体--战士之间。有远见的人想要改变世界，同时实现个人的掌握，希望二者相辅相成，相得益彰。有远见的人寻求了解世界（或宇宙），并将这种理解传递给他人，以创造一种新的状态。这种愿望使一些有远见的人变得高尚，但一些有远见的人想要的改变是别人所没有的。",
	"Only slightly different from an icon or visionary, a warrior still wants to leave a mark, but a warrior's motivation is more internal. A warrior seeks mastery and uses power based on personal goals and beliefs. Leaving a legacy is secondary or a side-effect of this personal quest for self-perfection. For the icon warrior, the fight is also secondary to fighting well.": "只不过与偶像或远见者略有不同，战士仍然希望留下痕迹，但战士的动机更加内在。战士根据个人的目标和信仰，寻求掌握和使用权力。留下遗产是次要的，或者说是这种自我完善的个人追求的副作用。对于偶像派的战士来说，战斗也是次要的，要打好。",
	"Countless figures from myth and fantastic fiction fit the icon archetype. Icons and warriors include Aragorn, Bruce \"Batman\" Wayne, Buffy Summers, Conan, Diana \"Wonder Woman\" Prince, Heracles, Joan of Arc, Madmartigan, and Xena. Iconic visionaries include Gandalf the Grey, Imperator Furiosa, Melisandre the Red Priestess, and Thanos.": "神话和奇幻小说中的无数人物都符合偶像的原型。圣像和勇士包括阿拉贡、布鲁斯-\"蝙蝠侠\"-韦恩、巴菲-萨默斯、柯南、戴安娜-\"神奇女侠\"-普林斯、赫拉克勒斯、圣女贞德、马德马特根和塞纳。标志性的远见者包括灰袍人甘道夫、小恶魔弗利奥萨、红色女祭司梅丽珊德和萨诺斯。",
	"A character who has the icon archetype values skill and competence. An icon treasures features that get them noticed and remembered. A visionary wants knowledge that then helps change the world, while a warrior seeks skills that improve personal capabilities. Subtlety rarely fits into any icon's personality unless the goal is to be famous for finesse.": "一个具有偶像原型的人物重视技能和能力。偶像珍视那些能让他们被注意和记住的特征。有远见的人希望获得有助于改变世界的知识，而战士则寻求能够提高个人能力的技能。微妙性很少适合任何偶像的个性，除非其目标是以精巧而闻名。",
	"An icon might have the following traits.": "一个图标可能具有以下特征。",
	"Ambition. What I accomplish matters more than who I am or what I do to reach my goals.": "雄心壮志。我的成就比我是谁或我为实现目标所做的事情更重要。",
	"Courage. Bravery is doing what needs to be done despite the odds.": "勇气。勇敢是不顾困难做需要做的事情。",
	"Glory. What people think of my successes means more than the deeds themselves.": "荣耀。人们对我的成功的看法比事迹本身更有意义。",
	"Mastery. Skill and competence are the gateways to success. Mastery is its own reward.": "掌握。技能和能力是通往成功的途径。掌握是对自己的奖励。",
	"Power. I need strength of body, mind, and spirit to be a hero, and it's my right to use my power.": "权力。我需要身体、思想和精神的力量来成为一个英雄，而且使用我的力量是我的权利。",
	"Self-Reliance. I must be ready for anything, so I think things through and prepare.": "自强不息。我必须为任何事情做好准备，所以我把事情想清楚并做好准备。",
	"Arrogant. When action is needed, my abilities and ideas have more weight than those of timid souls.": "傲慢无礼。当需要采取行动时，我的能力和想法比那些胆小的灵魂更有分量。",
	"Driven. I take it much too hard if I fail, which can drive me to extremes.": "有动力。如果我失败了，我就会把它看得太重，这会使我走向极端。",
	"Mistrustful. I appreciate competence and help, but I won't count on either being there.": "不信任。我欣赏能力和帮助，但我不会指望这两者的存在。",
	"Overconfident. I can do anything I set my skills to, and my foes are no match for me.": "过度自信。我可以做任何我设定的技能，我的敌人都不是我的对手。",
	"Rescuer. I'm always on the lookout for deeds that allow me to prove myself.": "拯救者。我一直在寻找能让我证明自己的事迹。",
	"Stoic. I'll do just about anything to avoid appearing scared, weak, or vulnerable.": "拘谨。我几乎会做任何事情来避免显得害怕、软弱或脆弱。",
	"An individualist is out to live life to the fullest. Fullest might mean with or without restraint, but the individualist often acts without inhibition. The individualist is a free spirit. Living life in the moment is part of the individualist's goal, but the real aim is to connect to others through enjoyment. An individualist doesn't take life too seriously, but is unlikely to do so in a naive way.": "个人主义者是为了最充分地享受生活。最充分可能意味着有或没有约束，但个人主义者的行为往往不受约束。个人主义者是一种自由精神。活在当下是个人主义者的部分目标，但真正的目的是通过享受与他人联系。个人主义者不会把生活看得太重，但不太可能以天真无邪的方式去做。",
	"Individualists tend to be personable and likable. However, they can be tricksters and liars, doing what they must to get what they want. Some are transgressive or hedonistic, breaking norms to seek pleasure. Most individualists are so focused on living in the now that they risk falling into indolence and trivial or silly diversions. Individualists are often rebels but seldom so much so that they become scoundrels. Avoiding boredom doesn't require a bad attitude.": "个人主义者往往是有个性的，令人喜欢的。然而，他们可能是诡计多端的骗子，为了得到他们想要的东西，他们必须做什么。有些人是越轨的或享乐主义的，打破规范以寻求快乐。大多数个人主义者如此专注于活在当下，以至于他们有可能陷入懒惰和琐碎或愚蠢的消遣中。个人主义者往往是反叛者，但很少如此，以至于他们成为无赖。避免无聊并不要求有不良的态度。",
	"It might seem like an irony, but many individualists want to be with another or others that appreciate them. These individualists not only seek joy but seek to please others. This relationship-seeking stance is less about caregiving in a self-sacrifice sense and more like \"we're in this together, so let's make the best of it.\" A partner is an enthusiastic supporter of those close to them. But in their fear of being unwanted, they risk being too much a social chameleon, losing themselves to the passions of others.": "这似乎是一个讽刺，但许多个人主义者希望与另一个或其他欣赏他们的人在一起。这些个人主义者不仅寻求快乐，而且寻求取悦他人。这种寻求关系的立场不像是自我牺牲意义上的照顾，而更像是 \"我们在一起，所以让我们把它做到最好\"。伴侣是对他们身边的人的热情支持。但由于他们害怕不被需要，他们有可能成为社会的变色龙，在别人的激情中失去自我。",
	"The individualist, as the name suggests, has many faces. Few conform to the expectations of their society but fewer go so far as to fall into ill repute. Most either fit in as the odd but lovable scamp or find a place in a counterculture. The more rigid the society, the more likely the individualist is to fit in but in a slightly rebellious way. Characters who fit this mold, counting partner types, include Austin Powers, Commander Shephard, Dr. Harleen \"Harley Quinn\" Frances Quinzel, Elizabeth Bennet, Kamala \"Ms. Marvel\" Khan, Lisbeth Salander, Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck, Remy Etienne \"Gambit\" LeBeau, and Tigger.": "个人主义者，顾名思义，有很多面孔。很少有人符合他们社会的期望，但更少有人走得那么远，以至于陷入恶名。大多数人要么以古怪但可爱的流氓身份融入社会，要么在反传统文化中找到一席之地。社会越是僵化，个人主义者就越有可能融入其中，但又略带叛逆。",
	"An individualist chooses skills and capabilities that make it easier to enjoy life. But each individualism has preferences that define enjoyment. A partner type is more likely to have abilities that support others. Most individualists have methods of catharsis, comic relief, or other releases. When the individualist shares these techniques, they can be helpful for everyone.": "个人主义者选择的技能和能力使其更容易享受生活。但每个个人主义都有定义享受的偏好。伙伴型的人更有可能拥有支持他人的能力。大多数个人主义者都有宣泄、喜剧缓解或其他释放的方法。当个人主义者分享这些技巧时，可以对大家有所帮助。",
	"Exceptional circumstances can push normal people to do remarkable deeds. It can be a one-time thing. A terrible situation demands that an ordinary person rises to an unexpected challenge. But some people find themselves thrust into a new course in life when conditions dictate that change. It's not what they chose, but it is something they face nonetheless.": "特殊的环境可以促使正常人做出非凡的事迹。这可能是一个一次性的事情。一个可怕的情况要求一个普通人奋起迎接一个意想不到的挑战。但有些人发现，当条件要求改变时，他们被推到了新的生活轨道上。这不是他们所选择的，但这是他们要面对的事情。",
	"The ordinary archetype is one of connection. It's the everyday person realizing they struggle for something more than themselves. A character with the ordinary archetype doesn't act the hero or even want to be noticed as unusual. Instead, they do what they must to ensure the surviving and thriving of the normal, from home and hearth to an idyllic or pastoral landscape.": "平凡的原型是一种联系。这是一个普通人意识到他们为比自己更重要的东西而奋斗。具有平凡原型的人物不会扮演英雄，甚至不希望被注意到是不寻常的。相反，他们做他们必须做的事情，以确保正常人的生存和繁荣，从家庭和炉灶到田园诗般的风景。",
	"Sometimes an ordinary person faces extraordinary circumstances more willingly and readily than others. These people break the \"ordinary\" mold intentionally. Such a character doesn't act for self-betterment the way a character if the icon or warrior archetype does. Others might call this person a hero, but they don't label themselves that way. An ordinary hero takes the forefront to fight for what they love—for connection.": "有时，一个普通人比其他人更愿意、更容易面对不寻常的环境。这些人有意打破 \"普通 \"的模式。这样的人物并不像偶像或战士原型的人物那样为了自我改善而行动。其他人可能会称这个人为英雄，但他们不会给自己贴上这样的标签。一个普通的英雄站在最前线，为他们所爱的东西而战--为了联系。",
	"Ordinary characters often develop heroic skills and traits as part of their story. At the start, they lack such features and instead possess skills and abilities that are more mundane. Ordinary characters often choose the practical over the flashy.": "普通人物往往在其故事中发展出英雄的技能和特征。在开始时，他们缺乏这样的特征，而是拥有比较平凡的技能和能力。普通人物往往选择实用而非浮华。",
	"An ordinary character might have these traits.": "一个普通的人物可能有这些特征。",
	"Connection. The people in my life matter most, and I do what I can for them.": "联系。我生命中的人最重要，我为他们做我能做的事。",

	"Fascinated. Everything is beyond my experience. It's interesting and a little overwhelming.": "很着迷。一切都超出了我的经验。这很有趣，也有点让人不知所措。",
	"Hesitant. I feel out of my depth, so I can be overcautious and fail to act swiftly.": "犹豫不决。我觉得自己力不从心，所以可能过度谨慎，不能迅速采取行动。",
	"Lazy. I've worked hard enough in my life, so I can take it easier now, and I will.": "懒惰。我这辈子已经够辛苦的了，所以我现在可以轻松一点，我也会这样做。",
	"Meek. I'm quiet- and gentle-natured, and so bold action and violence don't come naturally to me.": "温顺。我的性格安静而温和，所以大胆的行动和暴力对我来说并不自然。",

	"Unsophisticated. I'm used to a simple life, and my lack of experience translates into poor judgment or gullibility.": "不谙世事。我习惯于简单的生活，而我的缺乏经验转化为糟糕的判断力或轻信。",
	"The scoundrel archetype fits a character who exists outside the norms and doesn't like conventional rules or traditions. This is the archetype for iconoclasts, misfits, outsiders, radicals, rule breakers, and scallywags of all sorts. The scoundrel aims to misbehave. A scoundrel avoids connection, either due to old wounds from past relationships or because connection means responsibility the scoundrel doesn't want to take, or both.": "恶棍原型适合存在于规范之外，不喜欢传统规则或传统的人物。这是偶像崇拜者、不合群者、外来者、激进者、规则破坏者和各种无赖的原型。恶棍的目的是行为不端。无赖避免联系，要么是因为过去关系的旧伤，要么是因为联系意味着无赖不想承担的责任，或者两者都是。",
	"But most scoundrels also have something to prove. They want to be lauded by the right people for their actions. Those \"right people\" are often other mavericks the scoundrel associates with to avoid normal or virtuous people. Life has a way of showing a scoundrel what's important, forcing real connections, despite the scoundrel's efforts to remain detached.": "但大多数恶棍也有一些东西需要证明。他们希望自己的行为能得到正确人士的赞扬。这些 \"正确的人 \"往往是其他特立独行的人，无赖为了避免正常人或有德行的人而与之交往。生活有一种方式向无赖展示什么是重要的，迫使他们建立真正的联系，尽管无赖努力保持超脱。",
	"The typical scoundrel has a moral compass. Others lack this feature, having further lost their way due to awful circumstances or self-destructive tendencies.

	"Some folks are wholly themselves, or they think they are—always being who they are without seeking change. Striving to maintain their identity doesn't mean the character likes who they are, but change is seen as a threat. An unchanging nature is often stagnation, but in a stressful life, such as the adventuring one, this ethos requires immense will. Attachment to identity can act as an anchor, a stabilizing force in life.": "有些人完全是自己，或者他们认为自己是--一直是自己，不寻求改变。努力保持自己的身份并不意味着这个人物喜欢自己是谁，而是把变化看作是一种威胁。不变的本质往往是停滞不前的，但在紧张的生活中，比如冒险者，这种精神需要巨大的意志力。对身份的依恋可以作为一种锚，一种生活中的稳定力量。",
	"Many unaffected people have a hard or callous persona, maintaining this toughness as a life preserver. They are rocks in life's stream. Others, though, are plants in the same current.

Innocents are different from givers and individualists in that their entire focus is on remaining who they are despite events.": "许多未受影响的人有一个坚硬或冷酷的角色，保持这种坚韧作为生命的保障。他们是生活河流中的岩石。然而，其他人则是同一水流中的植物。天真无邪的人不会反抗，而是弯曲，然后恢复到以前的形状，往往具有热情和乐观，或像孩子一样的前景。无辜者与奉献者和个人主义者不同，他们的全部注意力都集中在保持自己的身份上，尽管发生了一些事件。",

To function as it should, each advanced weapon must be made with exactness, and each one is a masterpiece of the craft required to produce it. Hence, each advanced weapon has a high price. The Advanced Weapon Table summarizes these armaments and their unique uses. Descriptions of these weapons' properties include more details.": "Etharis的人们，尤其是矮人和侏儒，已经设计出复杂的武器来对抗世界上的噩梦般的怪物。各式各样的战士们也开发了复杂的技术，将设计简单但精确的武器变得更加致命。高级武器包括这两种做法，从新的武器到使用熟悉武器的新方法。为了发挥应有的作用，每件高级武器都必须精确制造，每一件都是生产它所需的工艺的杰作。因此，每件先进的武器都有很高的价格。高级武器表总结了这些军备和它们的独特用途。对这些武器属性的描述包括更多细节。",
	"Mastery of advanced weapons requires military training and skill. To use most weapons' advanced properties, you must be 3rd level or higher and have proficiency with all martial weapons. At 3rd level or higher, if you would gain proficiency with a martial weapon, you can choose an advanced weapon instead.": "掌握高级武器需要军事训练和技能。要使用大多数武器的高级属性，你必须达到3级或更高的等级，并且熟练掌握所有武术武器。在3级或以上，如果你想获得对武术武器的熟练度，你可以选择一个高级武器来代替。",
	"The following properties are new or altered for advanced weapons.": "以下是高级武器的新属性或改变的属性。",
	"An armor-piercing weapon is a melee weapon designed to punch through armor and thick hide alike. When you make an attack roll using an armor-piercing weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll if your target is wearing armor or has natural armor.": "穿甲武器是一种近战武器，旨在击穿盔甲和厚皮。当你使用穿甲武器进行攻击时，如果你的目标穿着盔甲或有天然盔甲，你将获得攻击卷的+1奖励。",
	"Blackpowder weapons fire projectiles with ear-splitting noise, shredding armor with deadly force. When fired, blackpowder weapons emit a deafening crack audible 300 feet away. A blackpowder weapon exposed to heavy rain, or submerged or similarly drenched in water, can't fire until dried for 1 hour.": "黑火药武器以刺耳的噪音发射弹丸，以致命的力量撕碎盔甲。发射时，黑火药武器会发出震耳欲聋的爆裂声，300英尺外都能听到。暴露在大雨中的黑火药武器，或被淹没或类似地浸泡在水中，在干燥1小时之前不能发射。",
	"A brutal weapon is designed for maximum damage. When you score a critical hit with a brutal weapon against a creature, you can roll an additional die of the weapon's damage dice, adding it to the damage total.": "残暴的武器是为最大的伤害而设计的。当你用残暴的武器对一个生物取得关键一击时，你可以在武器的伤害骰子上再掷一个骰子，把它加到伤害总数上。",
	"Cumbersome weapons are difficult to wield but are effective ranged tools for those strong enough to wield them. When making an attack with a cumbersome weapon, you must use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.": "笨重的武器很难挥舞，但对于那些足够强壮的人来说是有效的远程工具。当使用笨重的武器进行攻击时，你必须使用你的力量修正值来进行攻击和伤害卷。",
	"An advanced weapon that has the damage property can deal an alternative form of damage. You can choose the type when you attack or when you hit with an attack from any of the damage types mentioned.": "拥有伤害属性的高级武器可以造成另一种形式的伤害。你可以在攻击时或用上述任何一种伤害类型的攻击命中时选择该类型。",
	"A defending weapon is either made for parrying, has advanced techniques for use in parrying, or both. When you use a defending weapon, you can use your reaction to defend against a melee weapon attack that hits you. If you do, increase your AC by {@dice 1d4} against that attack.": "防御性武器要么是为抵挡而制造的，要么是具有用于抵挡的高级技术，要么是两者兼而有之。当你使用防御性武器时，你可以用你的反应来防御击中你的近战武器攻击。如果你这样做了，你对该攻击的反应力会增加（%0%）。",
	"A disarming weapon can catch a foe's weapon, allowing you to remove it from their grasp. When an opponent misses you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to attempt to disarm them. Both you and the attacker must make contested attack rolls. If you roll higher, and the weapon is something the target can drop, the weapon falls from the target's grasp, landing within 5 feet of the target in a space you choose. If you score a critical hit, and the attacker did not, you can send the weapon flying up to 15 feet away from the target into a space you choose instead. If you have a free hand when you score a critical hit this way, you can disarm the target so that you end up with the dropped weapon in your hand. If the attacker tied or rolled higher, then nothing happens.": "解除武装的武器可以抓住敌人的武器，让你从他们手中夺走武器。当对手用近战武器攻击你时，你可以用你的反应来试图解除他们的武装。你和攻击者都必须做出有争议的攻击卷。如果你掷得更高，并且武器是目标可以丢弃的，那么武器就会从目标的手中掉落，落在目标5英尺内你选择的空间里。如果你获得了关键一击，而攻击者没有，你可以让武器飞离目标15英尺远，进入你选择的空间。如果你以这种方式获得关键一击时有一只自由的手，你可以解除目标的武装，从而使你最终将掉落的武器握在手中。如果攻击者打成平手或滚得更高，那么就不会发生任何事情。",
	"A two-handed, double weapon functions as two light weapons, one in each hand, for two-weapon fighting purposes. If a double weapon has the reach property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.": "双手双兵器的功能是两把轻武器，两手各持一把，用于双兵器战斗。如果双武器有伸手的属性，你在同一回合内只能使用其中一个属性。",
	"An entangling weapon can tie a target up. When you hit with an entangling weapon attack against a target no more than one size larger than you, you can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. (This bonus-action use applies when you throw an entangling weapon because you're throwing with special preparation.) You don't need a free hand—the weapon fulfills that requirement. If you succeed, the target is grappled by you or the weapon if you're no longer holding it.": "纠缠武器可以将目标捆绑起来。当你用缠绕武器攻击比你大不超过一个体型的目标时，你可以使用你的额外行动来尝试抓取目标。(这个额外行动的使用适用于你投掷缠绕武器的时候，因为你的投掷是有特殊准备的）。你不需要自由的手，武器就能满足这个要求。如果你成功了，目标就会被你或武器抓住，如果你不再持有它的话。",
	"Until the grapple ends, you can't use the entangling weapon to attack a different target. If you aren't holding the entangling weapon, such as when you throw a gladiator net, the grapple continues, and the target needs to succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) or Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to escape the weapon.": "在抓捕结束之前，你不能使用纠缠武器来攻击其他目标。如果你没有拿着缠绕武器，比如你扔出一个角斗士网，那么抓捕继续进行，目标需要在DC10灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）或力量（{@skill Athletics}）的检定下成功逃脱武器。",
	"Guard weapons allow you to fight defensively, using the weapon's long haft or flat surface for parrying. While you wield a guard weapon, whenever a hostile creature moves within your reach when you didn't move on your last turn, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack with the guard weapon against that creature. If the attack hits, then it deals no damage, but the target immediately stops moving, and its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn.": "警卫武器允许你进行防御性战斗，使用武器的长柄或平面进行抵挡。当你挥舞护卫武器时，只要一个敌对的生物在你的范围内移动，而你在上一回合没有移动，你就可以用你的反应来用护卫武器对该生物进行武器攻击。如果攻击命中，则不造成伤害，但目标立即停止移动，其速度变为0，直到其回合结束。",
	"A hafted weapon's haft can function well as an off-hand attack. When you attack with only the hafted weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the haft. The haft deals {@dice 1d4} bludgeoning damage, and you add your ability modifier to damage as you would for other sorts of two-weapon fighting. If you have feats that mimic this ability, the damage dice becomes {@dice 1d8} instead.": "斧头武器的斧头可以很好地发挥脱手攻击的作用。当你只用斧头武器攻击时，你可以使用一个额外的动作，用斧头进行近战武器攻击。斧头会造成{@dice 1d4}重击伤害，你会在伤害上加上你的能力修饰，就像你在其他种类的双武器战斗中那样。如果你有模仿这种能力的特技，伤害骰子会变成（%1%）。",
	"A weapon with the magazine property also has a number and an ammunition type. The weapon holds that amount and type of ammo, which you can expend before needing to reload the weapon. Removing or loading a magazine counts as your interaction with an object, so doing both in one turn takes an action. A magazine weapon comes with one empty magazine included in the weapon's cost and weight. Loading an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.": "具有弹夹属性的武器也有一个数字和一个弹药类型。该武器持有该数量和类型的弹药，你可以在需要重新装载武器之前消耗这些弹药。取出或装入弹夹算作你与一个物体的互动，所以在一个回合内做这两件事需要一个行动。一个弹夹武器附带一个空弹夹，包括在武器的成本和重量中。给一个空弹夹装弹药需要1分钟。",
	"Momentum weapons allow you to deliver devastating attacks as part of rapid movement. When you hit a creature with a momentum weapon after you moved 20 feet or more in a straight line during the same turn, upgrade the damage dice to the weapon's momentum dice value.": "势能武器允许你在快速移动中进行毁灭性的攻击。当你在同一回合内直线移动20英尺或以上后，用动量武器击中一个生物，将伤害骰子升级为武器的动量骰子值。",
	"A monk gains proficiency with advanced monk weapons at 5th level.": "僧侣在5级时获得对高级僧侣武器的熟练度。",
	"When you attack with a precise weapon, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If a feature or item you have increases the numbers you can roll for a critical hit, a precise weapon increases that range by one. A fighter with Superior Critical, for instance, scores a critical hit on a roll of 17 to 20 with a precise weapon. Any roll lower than 20 must still hit to be a critical hit—it's not an automatic hit as if the roll was a 20.": "当你用精确武器攻击时，你可以在掷出19或20时获得关键打击。如果你拥有的特征或物品增加了你可以掷出的关键一击的数字，那么精确武器会使这个范围增加一个。例如，一个拥有高级危急值的战士，在使用精确武器的情况下，掷出17到20的分数就能获得危急值。任何低于20的卷轴都必须命中才是关键一击--这不是一个自动命中，就像卷轴是20一样。",
	"Besides the normal rules for this property, if a reach weapon has the double property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.": "除了这个属性的正常规则外，如果一个伸手可及的武器具有双重属性，那么在同一回合内你只能使用其中一个属性。",
	"Repeater weapons can fire ammo in quick succession, using multiple barrels or quick-reloading mechanisms. When you take the attack action with a repeater weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack again with the same weapon. You add your ability modifier to the damage the bonus-action shot only if that modifier is negative.": "中继武器可以使用多个枪管或快速装弹装置，快速连续发射弹药。当你使用连发武器进行攻击动作时，你可以使用一个额外的动作，用同一把武器再次攻击。只有当你的能力修饰值为负数时，你才会将你的能力修饰值加入到奖励行动射出的伤害中。",
	"Only entangling weapons can be restraining weapons. If you have a target {@condition grappled} with a restraining weapon, and you succeed on another attempt to grapple the target with the same weapon, the target becomes {@condition restrained} instead of {@condition grappled}. The target then remains {@condition restrained} until the grapple ends. If you stop holding the restraining weapon, the target can escape as if from an unheld entangling weapon.": "只有纠缠型武器可以成为限制型武器。如果你有一个目标{@condition grappled}的限制性武器，而你在另一次尝试用相同的武器抓取目标时成功，目标会变成{@condition restrained}而不是{@condition grappled}。然后目标会保持{@condition restrained}，直到抓捕结束。如果你停止持有限制性武器，目标可以像从一个未持有的纠缠性武器中逃脱。",
	"A returning weapon allows you to hurl the weapon in such a way that it returns to you. When you attack with a returning weapon, if you roll an even number on the {@dice d20}, the weapon returns to you by the end of your turn. You can catch the weapon if you have a hand free to do so. If not, the weapon lands at a random point within 5 feet of you. If you roll an odd number on the {@dice d20} for the attack roll, the weapon fails to return to you.": "回归武器允许你以这样的方式投掷武器，使其回到你身边。当你用返回的武器进行攻击时，如果你在{@dice d20}上掷出双数，武器就会在你的回合结束时返回你身边。如果你有一只手可以接住武器，你可以这样做。如果没有，武器会落在你周围5英尺内的一个随机点上。如果你在攻击卷的（%1%）上掷出奇数，武器就不能回到你身边。",
	"Scatter weapons can devastate multiple enemies at once. When you take the Attack action and hit a creature with a scatter weapon, measure the weapon's scatter range from the square the target you hit occupies to a point farther from you. Creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon's scatter range must attempt a Dexterity saving throw (DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability score modifier you use to determine damage for the scatter weapon). Creatures that fail take damage equal to the ability score modifier you use to determine damage with the weapon (minimum 1). This damage is of the same type you dealt to the original target.": "散射武器可以同时摧毁多个敌人。当你采取攻击行动并用散射武器击中一个生物时，测量武器的散射范围，从你击中的目标所在的方格到离你较远的一点。在武器散射范围内的原目标以外的生物必须尝试一个灵巧的蓄力动作（DC为8+你的熟练度加成+你用来决定散射武器伤害的能力得分修改器）。失败的生物受到的伤害等于你用来决定武器伤害的能力得分修正值（最小为1）。这种伤害与你对原始目标造成的伤害类型相同。",
	"You can use a bonus action on your turn to prepare, or \"set,\" a set weapon against a foe moving toward you. A weapon becomes unset if you move or take any action after setting it. If a target enters your reach while you have the weapon set, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the set weapon against that target. If you hit, and your target moved 20 feet or more toward you before the attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the damage total.": "你可以在你的回合中使用一个额外的行动来准备，或者说 \"设置 \"一个已设置好的武器来对付一个向你移动的敌人。如果你在设置后移动或采取任何行动，武器就会变成未设置。如果在你设置武器时，有一个目标进入你的范围，你可以使用你的反应，用设置的武器对该目标进行近战攻击。如果你命中了，并且你的目标在攻击前向你移动了20英尺或更多，你可以再掷一次武器的伤害骰子，并把它加到伤害总量中。",
	"An advanced ranged weapon with the strong-draw quality requires great strength to use. You must have a Strength of 13 or higher to use such a weapon, or you make attack rolls using the weapon with disadvantage. You add not only your Dexterity modifier to damage with a strong-draw weapon, but you also add 1 + half your Strength Modifier (rounded down) to the damage.": "具有强拉品质的高级远程武器需要强大的力量来使用。你的力量必须达到13或更高才能使用这种武器，否则你使用这种武器进行攻击时将处于不利地位。在使用强拉武器时，你不仅要在伤害上加上你的灵巧修正值，还要在伤害上加上1+你的力量修正值的一半（向下取整）。",
	"Swift weapons help you recover quickly from misses. When you miss with a swift weapon, you gain advantage on the first attack roll you make with the weapon against the same target before the end of your next turn.": "快速武器帮助你从失误中迅速恢复。当你用快速武器失手时，你在下一回合结束前用该武器对同一目标进行的第一次攻击卷中获得优势。",
	"A tripping weapon allows users to knock targets {@condition prone}. When you hit with a tripping weapon, you can use a bonus action to force your target to attempt a Strength saving throw, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). If the target fails, it falls {@condition prone}.": "绊倒武器允许使用者敲击目标（%0%）。当你用绊脚石武器击中目标时，你可以使用一个额外的动作来迫使你的目标尝试一个力量救赎，前提是目标不比你大一码。蓄力动作的DC等于8+你的熟练度加成+你的力量或灵巧修正值（你选择）。如果目标失败，它就会倒下（%1%）。",
	"Much as some folk have created advanced weapons and techniques, so too have they created ammunition to deal specialized damage. To utilize advanced ammunition, you must have proficiency in the weapon that uses the ammo, and you must be 3rd level or higher.": "正如一些人创造了先进的武器和技术一样，他们也创造了弹药来造成特殊的伤害。要使用高级弹药，你必须熟练掌握使用该弹药的武器，而且你必须是3级或以上。",
	"Most advanced ammunition is self-explanatory. A few special types are explained here.": "大多数先进的弹药是不言而喻的。这里解释一下少数特殊类型。",
	"Advanced ammunition named after a damage type deals that damage type. Arrows and bolts can have wide, slashing heads or heavy, bludgeoning tips. A sling bullet can have piercing facets. All such ammo is heavier than normal, so the weapon's maximum range using it is half normal.": "以伤害类型命名的高级弹药会造成该伤害类型。箭和枪可以有宽大的切割头或沉重的打击头。吊索子弹可以有穿透性的表面。所有这样的弹药都比正常的重，所以使用它的武器的最大射程是正常的一半。",
	"Ammunition that has the ranging property is lighter and better made than common counterparts. When you fire ranging ammo, you can increase your weapon's normal range by 50 percent.": "具有测距特性的弹药比普通的同类弹药更轻，做工更好。当你发射测距弹药时，你可以将你的武器的正常射程增加50%。",
	"Ammunition with the whistling property creates a high-pitched sound after firing. This sound is audible for 300 feet from the ammo as it flies. Whistling ammo isn't heavier, but it catches the air in baffles to create its sound, so its maximum range is half normal. Whistling ammo deals bludgeoning damage.": "具有啸叫特性的弹药在发射后会产生一种高亢的声音。这种声音在弹药飞行的300英尺内都能听到。啸叫的弹药并不重，但它用挡板捕捉空气来产生声音，所以它的最大射程是正常的一半。哨音弹药会造成重击伤害。",
	"Alchemical ammunition carries an alchemical payload. Rather than hurling a vial as an improvised weapon, you fire alchemical ammunition from a projectile weapon, using your normal attack bonus with that weapon. Alchemical ammunition deals the ammo's normal damage type in addition to delivering the alchemical effect. This ammo is heavy though, so a weapon's maximum range using alchemical ammo is half normal. The alchemical ammunition is destroyed once used, whether the attack hits or misses.": "炼金术弹药带有炼金术的有效载荷。与其将小瓶作为简易武器投掷，你不如用投射武器发射炼金弹药，使用该武器的正常攻击奖励。炼金术弹药除了提供炼金术效果外，还能造成弹药的正常伤害类型。不过这种弹药很重，所以使用炼金弹药的武器的最大射程是正常的一半。炼金弹药一旦使用就会被销毁，无论攻击是否命中。",
	"Other than how you hit a creature using alchemical ammo, these substances have their normal effects.": "除了你如何使用炼金弹药击中生物外，这些物质都有其正常的效果。",
	"When you fire war-oil ammo at an area and hit AC 10, viscous oil covers the area within 5 feet of a point you target. If you target a creature, you must hit that creature's AC to cover the creature in war oil. But if you hit the creature or AC 10, you can pick a point in or adjacent to that creature's space to determine the war oil's area as if you targeted a point.": "当你向一个区域发射战油弹并击中AC10时，粘稠的油会覆盖你目标点5英尺内的区域。如果你的目标是一个生物，你必须击中该生物的AC才能用战油覆盖该生物。但如果你击中了该生物或AC10，你可以在该生物的空间内或邻近的地方选取一个点来确定战油的区域，就像你瞄准一个点一样。",
	"War oil's area is difficult terrain. A creature standing in the area when it appears, that starts its turn in the area, or that enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone}.": "战油的区域是困难地形。当它出现时，站在该区域的生物，在该区域开始它的回合，或者在一个回合中第一次进入该区域的生物，必须在DC13灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会跌倒（%0%）。",
	"War oil is also flammable. If lit, such as by dealing fire damage to a creature covered in the oil, the oil burns for 2 rounds. Burning war oil deals {@dice 2d4} fire damage to any creature ignited in this way. An ignited creature can douse the flames by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames. If the creature ends its turn still aflame, the creature takes {@dice 2d4} fire damage. If war oil ignites in an area, a creature takes fire {@dice 1d4} damage when it enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn in that area. A creature can take fire damage from war oil only once per round.": "战油也是可燃的。如果被点燃，例如对被战油覆盖的生物造成火灾伤害，战油会燃烧2轮。燃烧的战油对任何以这种方式点燃的生物造成{@dice 2d4}的火焰伤害。被点燃的生物可以用它的行动来浇灭火焰，做一个DC 10的灵巧蓄力动作来熄灭火焰。如果该生物在其回合结束时仍然着火，则该生物会受到1%的火焰伤害。如果战油在一个区域内点燃，当生物在其回合内第一次进入该区域或在该区域内开始其回合时，会受到火灾（%2%）伤害。一个生物每回合只能从战油中受到一次火焰伤害。",
	"War oil dries and ceases to be slippery or flammable after 1 minute.": "战争油在1分钟后变干并不再滑溜或易燃。",
	"The following advanced ammunition properties impart more effectiveness to ammunition. Each piece of specialized ammunition can have only one of these properties. Because of the crafting skills required to make this ammunition, it is much more expensive.": "以下高级弹药属性赋予弹药更多的效力。每件专门的弹药只能有其中一种属性。由于制造这种弹药需要工艺技术，所以它要贵得多。",
	"This ammunition works like an armor-piercing melee weapon, but you fire the ammunition as a projectile from a ranged weapon.": "这种弹药的作用类似于穿甲近战武器，但你将弹药作为射程武器的弹丸发射。",
	"When you hit a fiend, fey, or undead with blessed ammunition, that creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. Also the creature can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.": "当你用受祝福的弹药击中魔族、妖族或亡灵时，该生物的速度会降低10英尺，直到下一回合结束。同时，该生物在下一回合结束前不能做出反应。",
	"Designed to open wide wounds, such as with a broad-bladed arrowhead, brutal ammunition works like a brutal melee weapon.": "旨在打开大范围的伤口，比如用宽刃的箭头，残酷的弹药的作用就像残酷的近战武器。",
	"When you hit a creature with incendiary ammunition, the target takes an additional {@dice 1d4} fire damage.": "当你用燃烧弹击中一个生物时，目标会受到额外的{@dice 1d4}火焰伤害。",

	"This is where Influence dice come into play. While playing in Grim Hollow, the players and the GM each have a pool of six-sided dice to draw upon in order to shift the fates in their favor. The players' dice are known as Resolve Dice, while the GM's pool consists of Beast Dice.": "这就是影响骰子发挥作用的地方。在《狰狞山谷》游戏中，玩家和GM都有一个六面骰子池，可以利用它来改变命运，使之有利于自己。玩家的骰子被称为 \"决心\"（Resolve Dice），而GM的骰子池由 \"野兽\"（Beast Dice）组成。",
	"At the start of a campaign, each pool has a single {@dice d6}, but events during the game can add or remove dice from each pool. After each session, if one dice pool has at least two more dice than the other then the GM should add an extra {@dice d6} to the pool with fewer dice to represent Fate attempting to correct the imbalance.": "在游戏开始时，每个骰子池都有一个{@dice d6}，但游戏中的事件可以从每个骰子池中增加或减少骰子。在每个环节之后，如果一个骰子池的骰子至少比另一个多两个，那么GM应该在骰子较少的池子中增加一个额外的{@dice d6}，以代表命运试图纠正这种不平衡。",
	"The dice in each pool can be spent to activate a number of different abilities, representing the ways in which Fate has been altered for good or for ill.": "每个池子里的骰子都可以用来激活一些不同的能力，代表着命运被改变的方式，无论好坏。",
	"During play, the number of dice in each pool is another factor for the players to consider when plotting their next course of action. For this reason, it is appropriate for the level of dice in the Beast Pool to be represented in-game, allowing the characters to react without metagaming and breaking immersion.": "在游戏过程中，每个骰子池的数量是玩家在策划下一步行动时要考虑的另一个因素。出于这个原因，在游戏中表现出野兽池中骰子的水平是合适的，可以让角色在没有元气和破坏沉浸感的情况下做出反应。",
	"One way to accomplish this is by interactions with NPCs. News may reach the party of some supernatural phenomenon which has the locals on edge, or the party's local informant warns them of an increase in monster attacks. Other times the party's surroundings themselves change to represent the growing threat. Omens and portents foretell disaster, and the creatures the party encounters take on a more disturbing appearance.": "实现这一目标的方法之一是与NPC的互动。一些超自然现象的消息可能会传到当事人那里，使当地人感到紧张，或者当事人的当地线人警告他们怪物袭击的增加。其他时候，玩家的周围环境也会发生变化，以代表日益增长的威胁。预言和预兆预示着灾难，党派遇到的生物也呈现出更令人不安的样子。",
	"By contrast, the Resolve Pool is best represented by the players themselves. Confidence and good humor can increase when the Resolve Pool outweighs the Beast Pool, but in Etharis such events are rare and fleeting.": "相比之下，\"决心池 \"最好由玩家自己来代表。当 \"决心池 \"超过 \"野兽池 \"时，信心和幽默感就会增加，但在伊萨里斯，这样的事件很少，而且转瞬即逝。",
	"The player characters in Grim Hollow are faced with a world of overwhelming odds, and in order to triumph, they must draw upon deep personal reservoirs of courage and willpower. This is represented by the Resolve Pool, a special pool of six-sided dice that the players can use to try and thwart fate and seize victory from the jaws of defeat.": "Grim Hollow中的玩家角色面对的是一个困难重重的世界，为了取得胜利，他们必须从个人深层的勇气和意志力中汲取养分。决心池代表了这一点，这是一个特殊的六面骰子池，玩家可以用它来尝试挫败命运，从失败中夺取胜利。",
	"The Resolve Pool starts with a single {@dice d6} but different events throughout the game can add dice to that pool, up to a maximum of six {@dice d6}. The GM can award dice to the party based on their actions or at specific plot moments within the game. If a player accurately and faithfully represents their character's bonds, flaws, and ideals in difficult circumstances, it's appropriate for the GM to award a Resolve Die based on their excellent roleplaying. Furthermore, certain actions may result in the reward of a Resolve Die if they represent events which would bolster the party's determination. Rare acts of self-sacrifice, kindness, or charity may act as a light in the darkness and help the party to forge ahead, as represented by the addition of a Resolve Die to the pool.": "决断池开始时只有一个{@dice d6}，但整个游戏中的不同事件可以将骰子添加到该池中，最多可以添加到六个{@dice d6}。GM可以根据玩家的行动或在游戏中的特定情节时刻授予骰子。如果一个玩家在困难的情况下准确而忠实地表现了他们角色的纽带、缺陷和理想，那么GM根据他们出色的角色扮演授予一个决心骰子是合适的。此外，如果某些行为代表了能够增强党的决心的事件，那么这些行为可能会导致 \"决心 \"的奖励。罕见的自我牺牲、仁慈或慈善行为可能会成为黑暗中的一盏明灯，并帮助党派向前迈进，就像在积分池中增加一个决心模子所代表的那样。",
	"Once there are dice in the Resolve Pool, the party can then draw upon them to activate special abilities throughout the game. Resolve Abilities can only be activated by spending dice from the Resolve Pool, and each ability has a certain cost as detailed in the description. Feel free to come up with your own list of abilities for the players to use their Resolve Dice on, but certain examples may include the following:": "一旦决心池中有骰子，党派就可以在整个游戏中利用它们来激活特殊能力。决心能力只能通过花费决心池中的骰子来激活，而且每种能力都有一定的成本，详见说明。你可以自由地想出你自己的能力清单，让玩家使用他们的决心骰子，但某些例子可能包括以下内容。",
	"Spending one Resolve Die during a short or long rest allows a player to remove a condition or one level of exhaustion. If the player needs to make a saving throw during that rest, such as for a disease or poison, they may roll the Resolve Die and add that number to their saving throw.": "在短期或长期的休息中，花费一个决心模子可以让玩家消除一个条件或一个等级的疲惫。如果玩家在休息期间需要进行救赎，例如针对疾病或毒药，他们可以掷出决心骰，并将该数字加入他们的救赎中。",
	"A player may spend a Resolve Die instead of a Hit Die to recover hp during a short rest or to activate any other ability that requires spending a Hit Die.": "玩家可以在短暂休息期间花费一个决心模子而不是一个命中模子来恢复hp，或者激活任何其他需要花费命中模子的能力。",
	"Whenever a player fails a death save, they may spend two Resolve Dice to reroll that save.": "每当玩家的死亡拯救失败时，他们可以花费两个决心骰子来重选该拯救。",
	"A player may spend any number of Resolve dice and roll them in order to immediately gain a single item with value equal to or less than twice the rolled total in gold pieces.": "玩家可以花费任意数量的决心骰子并掷出，以便立即获得一件价值等于或低于所掷金币总数两倍的单一物品。",
	"The party may spend all six Resolve Dice to grant themselves superhuman strength and resilience for a single round. During that round all party members have advantage on all rolls, resistance to all damage, and any damage they deal is doubled.": "派对可以花费所有六个决心骰子来赋予自己单轮的超人力量和复原力。在该回合中，所有党员在所有的卷轴上都有优势，对所有的伤害都有抵抗力，而且他们造成的任何伤害都是双倍的。",
	"The Beast is a powerful supernatural entity that stalks the lands of Etharis, and the Beast Pool represents the way that the forces opposed to the party affect the weave of Fate. This pool starts with a single {@dice d6}, but as things happen during the game, more may be added to represent the growing threat to body and mind.": "野兽是一个强大的超自然实体，在Etharis的土地上游荡，野兽池代表了反对党的力量影响命运的编织的方式。这个池子开始时只有一个（%0%），但随着游戏中事情的发生，可能会有更多的人加入，以代表对身体和心灵日益增长的威胁。",
	"Whenever the players take actions that darken the tone of the game, the Beast Pool gets another {@dice d6}. These events include murder of innocents, acts of selfishness or callousness, and so forth. Other things may add dice to the Beast Pool as well. When the party encounters a particularly strong, evil, or frightening creature, the Beast Pool receives another die. Similarly, the Beast Pool grows whenever the party witnesses something extremely horrifying or disturbing. Anything that would shake the resolve or threaten the psyches of the party qualifies. Actual fear effects associated with spells or abilities have no effect on the Beast Pool.": "每当玩家采取使游戏基调变暗的行动时，野兽池就会得到另一个（%0%）。这些事件包括谋杀无辜者、自私或冷酷无情的行为，等等。其他事情也可能为野兽池增加骰子。当党派遇到一个特别强大、邪恶或可怕的生物时，野兽池会得到另一个骰子。同样地，每当党派目睹一些极其恐怖或令人不安的事情时，野兽池也会增加。任何会动摇党的决心或威胁到党的精神的事情都符合条件。与法术或能力相关的实际恐惧效果对野兽池没有影响。",
	"As the Beast Pool grows, the GM gains access to Beast Abilities. These abilities are ways in which the GM may alter the balance of encounters at critical moments to hinder the party or bolster their enemies. Be warned that these abilities are best used to build tension and raise the stakes of an encounter rather than purely as a means to defeat the party. Some examples of Beast Abilities include the following:": "随着魔兽池的增长，GM会获得魔兽能力的使用权。这些能力是GM在关键时刻改变遭遇战平衡的方法，以阻碍玩家或支持他们的敌人。请注意，这些能力最好是用来制造紧张气氛和提高遭遇战的赌注，而不是纯粹作为击败队伍的手段。野兽能力的一些例子包括如下。",
	"The GM may spend one Beast Die in order to decrease the starting disposition of an NPC from Friendly to Indifferent, or from Indifferent to Hostile.": "GM可以花费一个兽模来将一个NPC的起始处置从友好降至冷漠，或者从冷漠降至敌对。",
	"When a player is reduced to 0 hp, the GM may spend one Beast Die and roll it. On a 5 or 6, that player immediately fails a death save.": "当一个玩家的生命值降至0时，GM可以花费一个野兽骰子并进行滚动。在5或6时，该玩家立即无法进行死亡拯救。",
	"The GM may spend any number of Beast Dice at the start of an encounter to increase the number of creatures facing the party. For each die spent, the GM may add an additional creature with CR no greater than half the party's average level, rounded down.": "GM可以在一场遭遇战开始时花费任意数量的野兽骰子来增加队伍所面对的生物数量。每花费一个兽骰，GM就可以增加一个CR值不超过本方平均水平一半的生物，向下取整。",
	"By spending four Beast Dice, the forces of darkness cause a serious ailment to strike a party member. The GM chooses a Curse or Transformation that afflicts a character of their choice. If using a Transformation for this ability, the possibility should be raised at the start of the game to ensure that such an event is acceptable to everyone at the table.": "通过花费四个野兽骰子，黑暗的力量会使一个党员受到严重的伤害。GM选择一个诅咒或变形来折磨他们选择的角色。如果使用变身的能力，应该在游戏开始时就提出这种可能性，以确保这种事件能被桌子上的所有人接受。",
	"Should the pool reach six, the GM may spend all six dice in order to have the Beast manifest near the players' location. The effects of the Beast's presence are felt throughout the region and vary based on the closest region of the empire: fleshy abominations in Abendland, vicious puppets in Rauland, corrupted beasts and plants in Nordenland, and armor-fused horrors in Unterland. This option may also be used to represent some other major threat based on locations outside the empire, such as an outbreak of coldfire in the Valikan Clans. These events cause serious damage to the local populace and represent a major, continuing threat for the party.": "如果池子里的骰子达到6个，GM可以花费所有的6个骰子，以便让野兽在玩家的位置附近显现。野兽存在的影响在整个地区都能感受到，并根据帝国最近的地区而有所不同：阿本德兰的肉体憎恶，劳兰的邪恶傀儡，诺登兰的腐化的野兽和植物，以及盎特兰的铠甲融合的恐怖。这个选项也可以用来代表其他一些基于帝国以外地点的重大威胁，比如瓦里肯部族的冷火爆发。这些事件对当地居民造成了严重的损害，并代表了对党的一个主要的、持续的威胁。",
	"Apart from Resolve Abilities and Beast Abilities, there are a set of abilities that can be activated with dice drawn from either pool. Both the GM and the party have access to Neutral Abilities, which represent more general methods of shaping the whims of Fate in your favor.": "除了 \"决断能力 \"和 \"野兽能力 \"之外，还有一组能力可以通过从任何一个池子中抽取的骰子来激活。GM和党派都可以使用中立能力，这代表了更多塑造命运之神对你有利的一般方法。",
	"Roll one die and add the total to a single attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.": "掷一个骰子，然后把总数加到一个攻击卷、能力检查或救赎动作中。",
	"Roll two dice and increase the maximum hit points of a creature by the total for eight hours.": "掷出两个骰子，将一个生物的最大命中率提高到总数，持续8小时。",
	"Whenever a creature is hit by an attack roll, the attacker may spend two dice and inflict an additional condition on the target for one round. This condition may be {@condition bleeding|GH}, {@condition dazed|GH}, {@condition prone}, or {@condition stunned}.": "每当一个生物被攻击卷击中，攻击者可以花费两个骰子，对目标造成一个额外的条件，持续一回合。这个条件可能是（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）或（%3%）。",
	"A creature may spend dice to mimic the effects of a spell. The level of the spell may be no greater than the creature's proficiency bonus, and the creature must spend dice equal to one plus the level of the spell to be invoked. Cantrips count as 1st-level spells for the purposes of this ability.": "一个生物可以花费骰子来模仿一个法术的效果。咒语的等级不能大于生物的熟练度加成，而且生物必须花费等于1加咒语等级的骰子来调用。在这个能力中，咒语算作一级法术。",
	"By spending two dice, the GM or a player may cause a minor alteration to the environment, such as adding a small item or feature, moving an existing object five feet, or slightly altering weather conditions or lighting. Examples would be a dropped weapon rolling out of reach or suggesting that phosphorescent fungi might bring a cave's lighting up to dim light rather than total darkness.": "通过花费两个骰子，GM或玩家可以对环境进行微小的改变，例如增加一个小物品或特征，将一个现有的物体移动5英尺，或稍微改变天气条件或照明。例如，一个掉落的武器滚到了伸手不见五指的地方，或者暗示磷光真菌可以使洞穴的照明达到昏暗的程度，而不是完全黑暗。",
	"In addition to these abilities, the GM has the ability to propose Dark Bargains to the players. The GM chooses a number of Beast Dice in their pool and proposes a course of action to a player. Should the player accept the bargain, the Beast Pool is reduced by the chosen number of dice and the player then proceeds to follow the suggested course of action. This allows the GM to introduce story elements and complications that the players may otherwise avoid, through the medium of demonic whispers and alien influences on the characters. This is a particularly useful avenue because it lets the GM leverage a character's bonds, ideals, or flaws.": "除了这些能力之外，总经理还有能力向玩家提出 \"黑暗交易\"。GM在他们的池子里选择一定数量的野兽骰子，并向玩家提出一个行动方案。如果玩家接受了这个交易，那么魔兽池就会减少所选的骰子数量，然后玩家就会按照建议的行动方案进行。这使得GM可以通过恶魔的低语和外星人对角色的影响，引入玩家可能会避免的故事元素和复杂情况。这是一个特别有用的途径，因为它可以让GM利用角色的联系、理想或缺陷。",
	"One example of a Dark Bargain would be a situation where a player discovers a cursed artifact while searching a mysterious assailant for clues. The GM offers the player a bargain: reduce the Beast Pool by two and the player will pocket the artifact for themselves without informing the other party members. The character has a greed-based flaw, so despite knowing that it's a bad idea they accept, setting the stage for the artifact to come into play later.": "黑暗交易的一个例子是，一个玩家在寻找神秘袭击者的线索时发现了一件被诅咒的神器。GM向玩家提供了一个交易：将野兽池减少2个，玩家将把神器据为己有而不通知其他党员。这个角色有一个贪婪的缺点，所以尽管知道这是个坏主意，他们还是接受了，这就为以后神器的出现创造了条件。",
	"As always, these rules are offered as suggestions. We strongly recommend groups expand upon and customize these rules to best fit the themes and playstyle of their game.": "一如既往，这些规则是作为建议提供的。我们强烈建议各团体对这些规则进行扩展和定制，以最适合他们游戏的主题和玩法。",
	"One way in which a group may do this is by relaxing the rules limiting Resolve and Beast Abilities to the party and GM, respectively. In certain circumstances it may make sense to allow party members to use abilities listed under the Beast Pool, such as when their actions align with the goals of the villain, and a GM may want to dip into the Resolve Abilities to boost the difficulty of an encounter.": "一个团体可以这样做的方法是，放宽对党派和 GM 的决心和野兽能力的限制。在某些情况下，允许党员使用 \"野兽池 \"中的能力是有意义的，比如当他们的行动与反派的目标一致时，而管理员可能想利用 \"决心 \"能力来提高遭遇战的难度。",
	"Another method of customization is by altering the abilities themselves. The Outnumbered ability from the Beast Pool, for example, can easily be adapted to summoning spells and moved over to the Resolve Pool. Inner Strength can be used to boost the healing of a fighter's Second Wind ability or to increase the level of a {@spell cure wounds} spell. Summoning the Beast can easily be swapped out for an appearance by whatever villain the GM has set as the primary antagonist of the campaign. All of these are appropriate uses of Influence Dice.": "另一种定制方法是通过改变能力本身。例如，野兽池中的 \"寡不敌众 \"能力可以很容易地适应召唤法术并移到决心池中。内在力量可以用来提高战士的第二风能力的治疗效果，或者增加一个（%0%）的法术等级。召唤野兽可以很容易地被替换成GM设定为战役中主要对手的任何恶棍的出现。所有这些都是影响力骰子的适当用途。",
	"Depending on the actions of the party and the GM, there may be a situation where a pool of dice fills completely and stays there for an extended period of time. One option to prevent this disparity is to allow a trade-off between the two. When a player would gain a Resolve Die, they may instead choose to decrease the Beast Pool by one. Similarly, when the GM would add a die to the Beast Pool, the increase in threat can be represented just as well by decreasing the Resolve Pool by one. This provides for a more fluid interplay between the two pools, acting almost like a tug-of-war on the weave of Fate's tapestry.": "根据党派和GM的行动，可能会出现骰子池完全填满并停留在那里很长一段时间的情况。防止这种差异的一个选择是允许在两者之间进行权衡。当玩家获得一个决心骰时，他们可以选择将兽池减少一个。同样地，当GM在野兽池中增加一个骰子时，威胁的增加也可以通过减少决断池中的一个来表示。这使得两个池子之间的相互作用更加流畅，几乎就像命运织锦上的拉锯战。",
	"As a final note, one bit of warning regarding these rules: in general, pitting party members against one another is something to be avoided. If you want to include this as an option in your game, or if you contemplate using some of these rules to that effect, we strongly recommend discussing this with your group ahead of time to make sure that everyone agrees with the idea. The most important thing is to have fun, and the rules should serve that goal, even if they have to be bent or broken at times.": "最后，关于这些规则的一点警告：一般来说，让党员相互对立是应该避免的事情。如果你想在你的游戏中加入这个选项，或者你考虑使用这些规则来达到这个效果，我们强烈建议提前与你的团队讨论这个问题，以确保每个人都同意这个想法。最重要的是玩得开心，规则应该为这个目标服务，即使它们有时必须被弯曲或打破。",
	"Starting a new campaign is exciting. Everyone is enthusiastic to create their new characters and dive into the story. It's tempting for everyone to create their characters in advance so you can all jump into your campaign the first time you meet.": "开始一个新的活动是令人兴奋的。每个人都热衷于创建自己的新角色并投入到故事中。对每个人来说，提前创建自己的角色是很有诱惑力的，这样你们就可以在第一次见面时就投入到你们的活动中。",
	"But, just like charging through a mysterious door without checking it for traps first, starting the game without planning can lead to everyone getting burned.": "但是，就像不先检查是否有陷阱就冲进一扇神秘的门一样，没有计划地开始游戏会导致每个人都被烧死。",
	"Session Zero is a term that has grown in popularity and understanding over the years in RPG circles. Session Zero refers to a game session that happens before the first day of game play, where the GM and players meet before a campaign begins to discuss what to expect from the game.": "零点会议是一个多年来在RPG圈子里越来越受欢迎和理解的术语。零点会议指的是在游戏的第一天之前发生的游戏会议，GM和玩家在活动开始之前会面，讨论对游戏的期望。",
	"In a Session Zero, everyone shares their hopes for the game, agreeing on some rules to help everyone have a good time. Session Zero can also involve players creating their characters and deciding what binds the party together. Finally, Session Zero is where you work out mundane details like scheduling to ensure the campaign runs smoothly.": "在 \"零点会议 \"中，每个人都会分享他们对游戏的希望，商定一些规则，以帮助大家度过一段美好时光。零点会议还可以让玩家创建他们的角色，并决定是什么将聚会联系在一起。最后，\"零点会议 \"是你解决诸如日程安排等世俗细节的地方，以确保活动的顺利进行。",
	"Every part of a Session Zero doesn't have to happen in a single sitting. Some of it can be worked out by email or informal means. But every step is important, because it's designed to head off issues that can derail your campaign down the road.": "零点会议的每一个部分都不一定要在一次会议上发生。其中一些可以通过电子邮件或非正式手段解决。但是，每一步都很重要，因为它的目的是为了避免可能使你的运动出轨的问题。",
	"Session Zero is a good idea for most tabletop roleplaying games, but it's especially important for this setting. Etharis is a campaign setting of dark fantasy, but \"dark\" means different things to different people.": "对于大多数桌面角色扮演游戏来说，\"会议零 \"是个好主意，但对于这个设定来说，它尤其重要。Etharis是一个黑暗幻想的活动环境，但 \"黑暗 \"对不同的人意味着不同的东西。",
	"People come to dark fantasy in general, and Etharis particularly, seeking different experiences. Maybe you came to explore the hard choices posed by a world of black-and-grey morality. Maybe you're drawn in by the unsettling mysteries of dark fairy tales. Maybe you seek the chill of encountering horrific deeds and unfathomable monsters. Or maybe you're after the thrill of dispatching those monsters in a spray of blood and viscera.": "一般来说，人们来到黑暗幻想，特别是伊萨里斯，寻求不同的体验。也许你是来探索一个黑与灰的道德世界所带来的艰难选择。也许你被黑暗童话中令人不安的奥秘所吸引。也许你寻求遇到可怕的行为和深不可测的怪物时的寒意。或者，你追求的是在鲜血和内脏的喷射中驱散那些怪物的快感。",
	"Some of this may appeal to you, and some of it might turn you off. Dark fantasy can mean playing with ideas that can ruin someone's game session—or worse—if they're handled carelessly. Part of Session Zero is designed to make sure everyone can agree on what they're getting into, and how much is too much.": "这其中有些可能会吸引你，有些可能会让你反感。黑暗幻想可能意味着玩一些想法，这些想法可能会毁掉某人的游戏会话--或者更糟--如果它们被不小心地处理。零点会议的一部分旨在确保每个人都能同意他们正在进入的东西，以及多少是太多了。",
	"This is the time for everyone—GM and players alike—to talk about what they want out of the upcoming campaign. At this stage, the GM should be flexible about the arc of the campaign, and players should be flexible about the details of their characters.": "这是每个人--GM和玩家--谈论他们想从即将到来的活动中得到什么的时候。在这个阶段，GM应该对战役的弧线持灵活态度，而玩家应该对他们的角色细节持灵活态度。",
	"New players may not feel equipped to decide what they want out of the game at this point, so don't pressure them. But do listen for what they are especially excited for or worried about.": "新玩家可能觉得没有能力决定他们在这个时候想从游戏中得到什么，所以不要给他们压力。但要倾听他们对什么感到特别兴奋或担心。",
	"Do players want a gritty, low-magic campaign or one focused on the intrigues of sorcerers and Arch Seraphs? Do they want to navigate the moral conflicts of an evil aristocracy or rise up heroically to overthrow it? Do they want to play good or evil characters? Has somebody always wanted to play a druid, or fight a vampire?": "玩家想要一个狡猾的、低魔力的战役，还是一个专注于巫师和大蛇夫的阴谋？他们想在邪恶贵族的道德冲突中游刃有余，还是想英勇地站起来推翻它？他们想扮演善良还是邪恶的角色？有人一直想扮演德鲁伊，或与吸血鬼战斗吗？",
	"To get at these answers, the GM should ask specific questions like the following:": "为了得到这些答案，总经理应该提出如下具体问题。",
	"What are you excited to do in this campaign?": "在这次活动中，你对做什么感到兴奋？",
	"What have you never done before that you'd like to try in this campaign?": "你以前从未做过什么，而你想在这次活动中尝试一下？",
	"What have you done before that you'd like to see more of in this game?": "你以前做过什么，你希望在这个游戏中看到更多的内容？",
	"What aspect of the campaign setting are you most interested in exploring?": "你对活动背景的哪个方面最感兴趣？",
	"Some possible answers may include the following: overthrow a tyrant, explore ruins, slay the Beast of Bürach, wonder who I can trust, hunt (or protect) mages and heretics, solve clever riddles, play a villain struggling toward redemption, play a hero slipping into evil...": "一些可能的答案可能包括以下内容：推翻暴君，探索废墟，杀死比拉赫的野兽，想知道我可以信任谁，猎杀（或保护）法师和异教徒，解决聪明的谜语，扮演一个挣扎着走向救赎的反派，扮演一个滑向邪恶的英雄......",
	"It's just as important to find out what people don't want, with questions like these:": "通过这样的问题，找出人们不想要的东西，也同样重要。",
	"What would you like to avoid in this game?": "在这个游戏中，你想避免什么？",
	"What have you done before that you'd like to see less of in this game?": "你以前做过什么，你希望在这个游戏中看到更少的情况？",
	"What aspect of the campaign setting interests you the least?": "你对活动设置中的哪方面最不感兴趣？",
	"Some possible answers include the following: getting hung up on inter-party conflict, underground dungeons, zombies, solving riddles, long fights with lots of enemies...": "一些可能的答案包括以下内容：纠结于党派间的冲突、地下城、僵尸、解谜、与大量敌人的长时间战斗。",
	"Everyone's answers to these questions should help shape the campaign. This is why the GM shouldn't be too invested in how the campaign will play out before they've seen what the players will bring to the table. Players generate new ideas for the game through what they're excited about. Even with a pre-written campaign, the GM and the players alike doubtlessly have ideas on how to steer the campaign toward the good stuff. Often the GM can find balance between what different players want, making sure there's \"something for everyone\" in each session.": "每个人对这些问题的回答都应该有助于塑造活动。这就是为什么GM在看到玩家会带来什么之前，不应该对游戏活动的发展有太多的投入。玩家通过他们感兴趣的东西为游戏产生新的想法。即使是预先写好的活动，GM和玩家无疑都有如何将活动引向好的方面的想法。通常情况下，GM可以在不同玩家的需求之间找到平衡，确保每个环节都有 \"每个人的东西\"。",
	"One excellent way to work through everyone's expectations for the game is by going over {@link Christopher Chinn's Same Page Tool|https://web.archive.org/web/20201224225928/http://briebeau.com/thoughty/2019/03/the-luxton-technique-by-p-h-lee/} with your group.": "一个很好的方法是通过与你的小组讨论{@link Christopher Chinn's Same Page Tool|https://web.archive.org/web/20201224225928/http://briebeau.com/thoughty/2019/03/the-luxton-technique-by-p-h-lee/}来解决大家对游戏的期望。",
	"There are many different ways that people play RPGs, from immersive improvisation to number-crunching wargaming and everything around and between. It's easy for people to come to the table with different expectations, perhaps feeling like other players' preferences for the game are \"wrong.\"": "人们玩RPG游戏有许多不同的方式，从沉浸式的即兴表演到数字计算的战争游戏，以及周围和之间的一切。人们很容易带着不同的期望来到桌前，也许觉得其他玩家对游戏的偏好是 \"错误的\"。",
	"This is where everyone should discuss their preferences about things like powergaming, ruleslawyering, and the GM making or interpreting rules on the fly. Everyone should agree on whether player characters are allowed to betray or fight each other.": "在这里，每个人都应该讨论他们对权力博弈、规则欺诈、以及GM临时制定或解释规则等事情的偏好。大家应该就是否允许玩家角色背叛或相互争斗达成一致。",
	"Figure out in advance whether everyone's approaches can coexist in a single campaign. There is probably room for compromise here. Players with different perspectives might agree on rules like, \"PC-versus-PC conflict is allowed if both players agree in advance,\" or, \"the GM can make up a rule on the fly if I can't find the real rule within 60 seconds.\"": "提前弄清楚每个人的方法是否能在一个运动中共存。这里可能有妥协的空间。有不同观点的玩家可能会同意这样的规则：\"如果双方玩家事先同意，允许PC与PC之间的冲突\"，或者，\"如果我在60秒内找不到真正的规则，GM可以临时编造一个规则\"。",
	"Unfortunately, not everyone's wants are compatible. Players may realize that they simply aren't interested in the type of game that the rest of the group wants to play. It's better to find this out before the campaign begins than after everyone has already invested time in a game they don't enjoy. Players with very different interests might be happier in separate campaigns with different focuses.": "不幸的是，不是每个人的愿望都能兼容。玩家可能会意识到，他们对小组其他成员想玩的游戏类型根本不感兴趣。在活动开始前发现这一点，总比大家已经在一个他们不喜欢的游戏中投入时间要好。兴趣非常不同的玩家可能会在不同的活动中更高兴，因为他们有不同的重点。",
	"As we mentioned above, the setting of Etharis is an opportunity to explore the darker themes of medieval fantasy. It's important to realize that players react differently to different elements of the game. Events or images that send a satisfying chill down one player's spine might spoil another player's fun entirely. Even playing with close friends, it can be hard to predict everyone's reactions without talking about it beforehand.": "正如我们上面提到的，Etharis的设定是一个探索中世纪幻想的黑暗主题的机会。重要的是要认识到，玩家对游戏的不同元素有不同的反应。让一个玩家感到满意的寒意的事件或图像可能完全破坏了另一个玩家的乐趣。即使与亲密的朋友一起玩，如果不事先讨论，也很难预测每个人的反应。",
	"To keep the game in the sweet spot for everyone at the table, you need to agree on some boundaries. This way, you can all play secure in the knowledge that your adventures in Etharis may frighten or disturb you, but only in the ways you signed up for.": "为了使游戏对每个人都有好处，你们需要就一些界限达成一致。这样一来，你们都可以放心地玩，因为你们在伊萨里斯的冒险可能会吓到或打扰到你们，但只是以你们报名的方式。",
	"This section talks about players deciding what they are and aren't comfortable with, but don't forget that the GM is a player too! The GM gets an equal chance to set boundaries, and they should be as up-front about those boundaries as the other players.": "本节谈论的是玩家决定他们可以接受什么和不可以接受什么，但是不要忘记，GM也是一个玩家！GM也有同样的机会设定界限，他们应该和其他玩家一样公开这些界限。GM有平等的机会来设定界限，他们应该像其他玩家一样坦率地说出这些界限。",
	"Rating systems for movies, television shows, and other media can be a useful shorthand for what players are comfortable with. People generally understand how the American movie ratings of G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC- 17 correspond to different levels of violence, sexuality, and other content. This kind of language can set a general baseline for what players are comfortable with.": "电影、电视节目和其他媒体的评级系统可以成为一个有用的速记工具，说明玩家可以接受的内容。人们通常理解美国电影的G、PG、PG-13、R和NC-17等级是如何对应不同程度的暴力、性和其他内容的。这种语言可以为玩家所能接受的内容设定一个总体基线。",
	"Even with that general guideline in place, though, everyone has certain topics that they find particularly upsetting, whether because of their life experiences or for other reasons. It's best to approach these topics carefully, or to avoid them entirely in the game.": "不过，即使有这样的一般准则，每个人都有某些他们认为特别令人不安的话题，无论是因为他们的生活经历还是其他原因。最好是小心翼翼地对待这些话题，或者在游戏中完全避免它们。",
	"To help everyone explore the darkness on their own terms, it's helpful for the players to discuss in advance what topics they would like to avoid.": "为了帮助每个人按照自己的条件探索黑暗，玩家提前讨论他们希望避免哪些话题是很有帮助的。",

	"One popular method for setting specific boundaries for a game that approaches sensitive topics is called \"lines and veils.\" During Session Zero, the GM should invite players to write down their lines and veils for the upcoming campaign.": "为接近敏感话题的游戏设定具体界限的一种流行方法被称为 \"界限和面纱\"。在零次会议期间，GM应该邀请玩家写下他们在即将到来的活动中的台词和面纱。",
	"Lines and veils were first described by Ron Edwards for his game \"Sex and Sorcery.\"": "线条和面纱最早是由罗恩-爱德华兹为他的游戏 \"性与魔法 \"描述的。",
	"When you \"draw the line\" at a topic, you agree that it will never come up in play. Perhaps someone draws a line at \"slavery\"—this means the game should never encounter slaves or slavers in the game, or hear rumors of gnolls enslaving people in a far-off land. It is as if the practice or concept of slavery does not exist in your game world. If the lined topic exists at all, it is off-screen and never mentioned.": "当你对一个话题 \"划清界限 \"时，你同意它永远不会在游戏中出现。也许有人以 \"奴隶制 \"为界--这意味着游戏中不应该遇到奴隶或奴隶主，或者听到地精在遥远的地方奴役人的传闻。这就好像奴隶制的做法或概念在你的游戏世界中不存在一样。如果这个排他性的话题存在，那也是在屏幕之外，从未被提及。",
	"Some lines rule out a portion of the setting. If \"disease\" is a line, the party should never encounter plague doctors or visit the city of Liesech, for example. If those aspects of the setting were going to ruin someone's experience, it's best to find that out now. The world of Etharis is wide enough—and full enough of horrors—to provide adventure without exploring every dark crevasse.": "有些线路排除了一部分的设定。例如，如果 \"疾病 \"是一条线，那么党派就不应该遇到瘟疫医生或访问Liesech城。如果设定中的这些方面会毁掉某人的经历，最好现在就发现。伊萨里斯的世界足够宽广，而且充满了恐怖，可以提供冒险，而不必探索每一个黑暗的裂缝。",

	"The world of Etharis, and every other fantasy setting, ignore all manner of things, from the economic impact of adventurers spending large sums of gold to the physical impossibility of a colossal-sized dragon flying by flapping its wings. A world without inflation or the square-cube law is not \"realistic,\" but we don't pull on those threads for a simple, very good reason: it lets us play the game we want to play. We focus on the aspects of the game world that we want the game to be about, and we ignore the parts that would get in the way. Sometimes this requires the active suspension of disbelief. More often we just go with it, and everything's fine.": "伊萨里斯的世界，以及其他所有的奇幻设定，都忽略了各种事情，从冒险者花费大量黄金的经济影响到巨龙拍打翅膀飞行的物理不可能性。一个没有通货膨胀或方块定律的世界是不 \"现实 \"的，但我们没有拉上这些线，原因很简单，非常好：它让我们玩我们想玩的游戏。我们专注于我们希望游戏世界的那些方面，而忽略那些会妨碍游戏的部分。有时，这需要积极地悬置不信的想法。更多时候，我们只是顺其自然，一切都很好。",
	"When you \"draw a veil\" across a topic, it can exist in the game but will not be described or played out in detail.

	"Invite everyone to write down their lines and veils. You may even combine these into a single, anonymous list. Doing this lets players set boundaries without having to flat-out tell the group that—for example—they have crippling arachnophobia.": "请大家写下他们的台词和面纱。你甚至可以把这些东西合并成一个单一的、匿名的清单。这样做可以让玩家设定界限，而不必直截了当地告诉大家--例如，他们有严重的蜘蛛恐惧症。",
	"Players may want to draw more or less specific boundaries. For example, a player may be okay with torture happening in the game, but not with the PCs doing it—or not with it happening to PCs or specific NPCs. An arachnophobic player may be okay with spiders as long as they aren't described in detail, or as long as they're not too big (or too small).": "玩家可能想划出更多或更少的具体界限。例如，玩家可能对游戏中发生的酷刑没有意见，但不希望PC做这种事，或者不希望它发生在PC或特定NPC身上。有蜘蛛恐惧症的玩家可以接受蜘蛛，只要不对它们进行详细描述，或者只要它们不是太大（或太小）。",
	"It's important to respect each player's boundaries. Once someone has said that they don't want something in the game, they shouldn't have to justify the boundary to the rest of the table. Likewise, boundaries also shouldn't be up for negotiation. More importantly, a player should be able to add to or change their own boundaries at any time depending on their comfort level. In the next section, we'll discuss a few ways to handle when something goes too far in the course of play.": "尊重每个玩家的界限是很重要的。一旦有人说他们不想要游戏中的东西，他们就不应该向桌子上的其他人证明这个界限。同样地，界限也不应该是可以协商的。更重要的是，玩家应该能够根据自己的舒适程度，随时增加或改变自己的界限。在下一节中，我们将讨论在游戏过程中，当某些事情走得太远时的一些处理方法。",
	"Once you've established what everyone wants out of the game, and what the boundaries are, you have a large and well-defined play-space of concepts and emotions to explore.": "一旦你确定了每个人都想从游戏中得到什么，以及边界是什么，你就有一个大的、定义明确的概念和情感的游戏空间可以探索。",
	"Boundaries can change. You may not know how you'll react to something until the moment it comes up at the table. Depending on your mood when you come to the table, you may have more or less tolerance for upsetting material. Finally, surprises and accidents happen. That's why it's also wise to decide how to handle uncomfortable situations that come up in the course of the game.": "界限可以改变。你可能不知道你对某件事情会有什么反应，直到它出现在餐桌上的那一刻。根据你来到餐桌前的心情，你可能对不愉快的材料有更多或更少的容忍。最后，惊喜和意外会发生。这就是为什么决定如何处理游戏过程中出现的不舒服的情况也是明智的。",
	"A player or the GM may forget an established boundary or cross it without meaning to. The best thing to do in this situation is to pause the action, acknowledge what happened, and apologize. Depending on how everyone is feeling, a short break may be appropriate. When the game resumes, the table can decide whether it's better to change what happened in the narrative, or simply to move on.": "玩家或GM可能会忘记既定的边界，或者无意中越过边界。在这种情况下，最好的办法是暂停行动，承认发生了什么，并道歉。根据每个人的感觉，短暂的休息可能是合适的。当游戏恢复时，桌子可以决定是改变叙述中发生的事情，还是简单地继续前进。",

The active player or the GM immediately stops and moves the narrative forward, away from the current deeds taking place at the table.": "简而言之，X卡是一张放在桌子上的实体卡。在游戏过程中，如果叙述朝着他们不舒服的方向发展，任何玩家都可以拍打这张卡或以其他方式 \"激活 \"它。活跃的玩家或总经理会立即停止，并将叙事向前推进，远离当前在桌子上发生的事迹。",
	"An advantage of the X-Card is that it does not put a lot of pressure on the uncomfortable player to explain exactly what the problem is in the moment. A player may explain why they activated the X-Card after the game, if there is any confusion, when everyone is more comfortable.": "X卡的一个好处是，它不会给不舒服的棋手带来很大的压力，让他在当下准确解释问题所在。如果有任何困惑，棋手可以在赛后解释他们为什么要激活X卡，那时大家都会比较舒服。",
	"This is a different approach to handling upsetting events in the game. In short, when a player identifies that something in the game is upsetting them, play pauses. The player has an opportunity to explain what the problem is, if they wish. The player then states what they want or need to happen in the narrative—for example, \"I need this NPC to survive this encounter,\" or, \"I need the townspeople not to believe the villain's lies about what just happened.\" The players and the GM then ensure that that the stated result comes about. If the outcome of a die roll (such as an attack roll or a save) would determine the outcome, do not roll—the ultimate outcome should not be in question.": "这是一种处理游戏中令人不快的事件的不同方法。简而言之，当玩家发现游戏中的某些事情让他们感到不安时，游戏就会暂停。如果玩家愿意，他们有机会解释问题是什么。然后，玩家说明他们希望或需要在叙事中发生什么--例如，\"我需要这个NPC在这次遭遇中幸存下来，\"或者，\"我需要镇民不要相信恶棍关于刚刚发生的事情的谎言。\" 然后，玩家和GM就会确保既定的结果得以实现。如果掷骰子的结果（如攻击或救赎）会决定结果，就不要掷骰子--最终的结果不应该有问题。",
	"This technique is meant to address situations where it may be more upsetting to skip over the upsetting event or pretend it didn't happen.": "这种技巧是为了解决跳过不愉快的事件或假装它没有发生可能会更令人不安的情况。",
	"{@i The Luxton Technique} was described in detail in a blog post by P.H. Lee, as an alternative to the X-Card.": "{@i The Luxton Technique}在P.H.Lee的一篇博文中做了详细描述，作为X卡的一个替代。",
	"A variety of other safety tools are available online in the {@i TTRPG Safety Toolkit}, an online collection maintained by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk.": "其他各种安全工具可在{@i TTRPG Safety Toolkit}中在线获得，这是一个由Kienna Shaw和Lauren Bryant-Monk维护的在线集合。",
	"{@link The Script Change RPG Toolkit|https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change} by Brie Beau Sheldon is another set of tools that builds on the Luxton Technique and the movie rating metaphor. It provides a range of ways to let players take control of the narrative in the moment.": "{@link The Script Change RPG Toolkit|https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change}，作者Brie Beau Sheldon是另一套建立在Luxton Technique和电影评级隐喻上的工具。它提供了一系列的方法，让玩家在当下控制叙事。",
	"Not every group needs a mechanic this structured in order to have these discussions, but when it comes to uncomfortable conversations, it can be helpful to err on the side of having more structure than you need.": "并非每个小组都需要一个如此结构化的机制来进行这些讨论，但当涉及到不舒服的对话时，在拥有比你需要的更多结构方面犯错是有帮助的。",
	"In any case, the important thing to remember is that each and every person at the table is more important than the game.": "在任何情况下，要记住的是，餐桌上的每一个人都比游戏更重要。",
	"Once you've agreed on the boundaries of the game, it's time for the players to decide who their characters will be. This can be full character creation, or simply deciding on the characters' concepts and backstories.": "一旦你同意了游戏的边界，就该让玩家决定他们的角色是谁了。这可以是完整的角色创建，或者简单地决定角色的概念和背景故事。",
	"Players should also decide why their characters adventure together. Players can either give their characters pre-existing relationships, or decide how their personalities mesh once the characters meet for the first time. Figuring this out in advance avoids the \"party of loners\" situation, where there's no in-game reason that the PCs keep putting up with each other and risk their lives for each other adventure after adventure.": "玩家还应该决定他们的角色为什么一起冒险。玩家可以让他们的角色有预先存在的关系，或者在角色第一次见面时决定他们的性格如何融合。提前想好这个问题可以避免出现 \"独行侠聚会 \"的情况，即在游戏中没有任何理由让NPC继续忍受对方，并在一次次冒险中为对方冒生命危险。",
	"Use backgrounds and bonds as jumping off points for players to decide how their characters might be connected. A player might ask the table, \"Which of your characters might my character have met during his time as a sailor?\"": "利用背景和纽带作为跳板，让玩家决定他们的角色可能有什么联系。一个玩家可能会问桌子，\"我的角色在做水手的时候可能会遇到你们的哪些角色？\"",
	"Traits and flaws can serve as seeds for relationships between characters. One player could volunteer, \"What if the way your character stammers under pressure reminds her of her younger brother, and so she feels protective of your character?\"": "特质和缺陷可以作为角色之间关系的种子。一个玩家可以自告奋勇地说：\"如果你的角色在压力下结结巴巴的样子让她想起了她的弟弟，所以她对你的角色感到保护，那会怎么样？\"",
	"Alternatively, \"My character steals small items even when it's a bad idea—does anyone else's character watch mine especially closely, to make sure she behaves?\"": "或者说，\"我的角色偷窃小物品，即使这是个坏主意--有没有人的角色特别密切地观察我的角色，以确保她的行为？\"",
	"A key part of building relationships this way is that both players should be excited about the new connection. One player should not force a relationship on another player's character.": "以这种方式建立关系的一个关键部分是，双方玩家应该对新的联系感到兴奋。一个玩家不应该把关系强加给另一个玩家的角色。",
	"Once these decisions have been made, the GM can start making concrete plans about what will happen in the campaign. Part of the joy of running a tabletop game is seeing what characters the other players create, and finding out what those characters do in different situations. Now the GM knows who the PCs are, and what kind of adventures make sense for them—and who the players are, and what kind of adventures will be the most fun for {@i them}.": "一旦做出了这些决定，GM就可以开始对活动中会发生的事情做出具体的计划。运行桌面游戏的部分乐趣在于看到其他玩家创造了什么角色，并发现这些角色在不同情况下会做什么。现在，GM知道了谁是PC，什么样的冒险对他们来说是有意义的--谁是玩家，什么样的冒险对{@i them}来说是最有趣的。",
	"Nobody enjoys scheduling, but working out a schedule is a lot better than constantly cancelling sessions or playing with half a party. Figure out a cancellation policy, including what happens to player characters if their player doesn't show up to a session.": "没有人喜欢安排时间，但制定一个时间表要比不断取消会议或用一半的人玩要好得多。制定一个取消政策，包括如果玩家的角色没有出现在会议中会发生什么。",
	"A good strategy is to decide on a day—like every Saturday, or every other Sunday—that works for everyone most of the time. Players then know what to expect, and they can try to keep that day open. If players can't make a session, cancel it until next week, but don't change the day. If you move game day around in the week, chasing the gaps in players' schedules, you'll find sessions are unpredictable and far-between, and scheduling them is a never-ending headache. Everyone should also decide how long the campaign should last, so they know how much time they're committing to it. (Don't be afraid to start a short campaign. You can always re-up with the same characters if everyone wants to keep going.)": "一个好的策略是决定一个日子，比如每个星期六，或每隔一个星期天，这对每个人来说大部分时间都是可行的。这样玩家们就知道该怎么做了，他们可以尝试保持这一天的开放。如果玩家不能来参加会议，就取消它，直到下周，但不要改变日期。如果你在一周内把游戏日移来移去，追逐玩家日程表上的空隙，你会发现会议是不可预测的，而且间隔很远，安排会议是一个永无休止的头痛问题。每个人都应该决定活动应该持续多长时间，这样他们就知道自己要投入多少时间。(不要害怕开始一个短的活动。如果每个人都想继续下去，你总是可以用相同的角色重新开始。）",
	"Session Zero is also where you should work out questions like who brings what snacks, and whether you share dice or everyone brings their own. You may also want to work out whether people are comfortable with alcohol and other substances at the table.": "零点会议也是你应该解决的问题，比如谁带什么零食，以及你是分享骰子还是每个人都带自己的。你可能还想弄清楚人们对餐桌上的酒精和其他物质是否适应。",
	"When you're done with all this, you'll have a solid plan in place to start a great campaign for everyone.": "当你完成这一切后，你将有一个坚实的计划，为大家开始一个伟大的运动。",
