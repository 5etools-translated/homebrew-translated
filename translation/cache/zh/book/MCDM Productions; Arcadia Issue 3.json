	"Well, here we are at our first stop on the ARCADIA road. From the beginning, we said MCDM planned to make three issues and assess whether or not to keep going. When we began this endeavor, I wasn't sure how the magazine would be received. Did people want more fifth edition content on a regular basis? There's already a lot out there! That's why we needed to do more than just provide content. This magazine needed to be something special with the best writers and artists we could find. So we built an exceptional team, and we liked what we created, but how did you react?": "好了，我们到了ARCADIA道路上的第一站。从一开始，我们说MCDM计划做三期，然后评估是否继续下去。当我们开始这项工作时，我并不确定这本杂志会被如何接受。人们是否希望定期有更多的第五版内容？外面已经有很多了! 这就是为什么我们需要做的不仅仅是提供内容。这本杂志需要与我们能找到的最好的作家和艺术家一起成为特别的东西。因此，我们建立了一个卓越的团队，我们喜欢我们创造的东西，但你有什么反应？",
	"The answer: super positively. I'm writing this letter after the release of issue 1, and already your responses and enthusiasm for the content exceeds my highest hopes. Our Patreon numbers blasted off, we're getting all sorts of love on social media, and you're also finding, following, and praising our authors and artists. You've spoken. You want more ARCADIA, and we'll be giving it to you.": "答案是：超级积极的。我是在第一期发行后写这封信的，你们的反应和对内容的热情已经超过了我的最高期望。我们的Patreon数字爆炸了，我们在社交媒体上得到了各种爱，而且你也在寻找、关注和赞扬我们的作者和艺术家。你已经说了。你们想要更多的ARCADIA，而我们会给你们的。",
	"In fact, authors, artists, and playtesters are already cranking on future issues. We're still working out the timeline for releases, but we hope to get you illustrated, edited, playtested content on a regular basis as we fine-tune our process for indefinite production.": "事实上，作者、艺术家和游戏测试者已经开始着手准备未来的问题。我们仍在制定发布的时间表，但我们希望在我们为无限期生产而微调的过程中，定期为你提供经编辑和测试的内容。",
	"ARCADIA is still evolving, and the team does that by listening to you. Our first ARCADIA survey will be available to Patreon patrons shortly after we publish this issue. The results help us pinpoint the most useful and fun content for your gaming table, and let you make requests for articles you'd like to read in the future. We'll also ask you about new content we have ideas for! We want to know what you like, because you help make ARCADIA a hit!": "ARCADIA仍在不断发展，而团队是通过倾听你的意见来实现的。我们的第一次ARCADIA调查将在我们出版本期杂志后不久向Patreon赞助人提供。调查结果可以帮助我们确定对你的游戏桌最有用和最有趣的内容，并让你提出你想在未来阅读的文章的要求。我们也会询问你关于我们有想法的新内容! 我们想知道你喜欢什么，因为你帮助使《ARCADIA》成为一个热门期刊",
	"Our Patreon surveys aren't the only place to talk to us about ARCADIA. The MCDM Discord and Reddit communities have great folks talking about all things RPG. (Shoutout to the incredible MCDM community moderators who really make these wonderful places to hang.) In fact, these are great places to go to find fans creating their own content inspired by the magazine. Remember Willy Abeel's \"Jumping on Mounted Combat\" article? You can find a bunch of new mount stat blocks on Reddit inspired by what Willy created. That's just the tip of the incredible iceberg.": "我们的PATREON调查并不是唯一可以和我们谈论ARCADIA的地方。MCDM Discord和Reddit社区有很多人在讨论所有关于RPG的事情。(向难以置信的MCDM社区版主致敬，他们真的让这些地方变得很好。) 事实上，这些都是很好的地方，可以找到粉丝们在杂志的启发下创造他们自己的内容。还记得Willy Abeel的 \"跳跃的骑战 \"文章吗？你可以在Reddit上找到一堆新的坐骑状态块，其灵感来自于威利所创造的内容。这只是不可思议的冰山一角。",
	"With all this talk about the future, I almost forgot to tell you that this issue of ARCADIA is our most ambitious yet. We have four incredible articles for you, all of which focus on new areas of the game for this magazine: a roleplaying-focused mystery adventure from Alison Huang, ten new spells for fifth edition from Celeste Conowitch, three new dream-focused ancestries from Justice Arman, and rules for aerial combat from Sam Mannell. So far we've had dungeon crawls, mysteries, subclasses, spells, ancestries, monsters, and all kinds of new rules. What will we do next? Join our communities. Let us know.": "说了这么多关于未来的事情，我差点忘了告诉你们，这一期的《ARCADIA》是我们最雄心勃勃的一期。我们为你准备了四篇令人难以置信的文章，所有这些文章都集中在本杂志的游戏新领域：Alison Huang的以角色扮演为重点的神秘冒险，Celeste Conowitch为第五版提供的十个新法术，Justice Arman的三个以梦为重点的新祖先，以及Sam Mannell的空中战斗规则。到目前为止，我们已经有了地牢爬行、神秘、子类、法术、祖先、怪物和各种新规则。我们接下来会做什么？加入我们的社区。让我们知道。",

	"THREE DREAM-THEMED ANCESTRIES": "三个以梦为主题的祖先",
	"by Justice Arman": "作者：Arman法官",
	"To ordinary creatures, dreams are a fleeting source of inspiration. A gnome inventor jolts from their bed and dashes to the workshop, the spark of ingenuity fresh in their mind. A humble farmer dreams of faraway riches and trading their spade for a sword. But in the hands of more powerful entities, dreams transcend imagination and become tools of limitless potential. This article presents three new character ancestries inspired by sleep and dreams.": "对普通生物来说，梦是一种转瞬即逝的灵感来源。一个地精发明家从床上一跃而起，冲向车间，脑海中闪现出独创性的火花。一个卑微的农民梦想着远方的财富，用他们的铲子换一把剑。但在更强大的实体手中，梦想超越了想象力，成为潜力无限的工具。本文介绍了三个由睡眠和梦境激发的新角色祖先。",
	"Agents of meddling gods use dreams to deliver prophetic messages. Dreams are battlegrounds for cosmic defenders and slumbering psionic dragons, waging war against reflections of unfathomable evil in an endless sea of thought. Ancient aberrations enter deep trances, willing creatures into existence in crescendos of unconscious creation.": "爱管闲事的神的代理人利用梦境来传递预言信息。梦境是宇宙卫士和沉睡的幻象龙的战场，在无尽的思想之海中与深不可测的邪恶的反映开战。古老的反常者进入深沉的恍惚状态，在无意识的创造的高潮中使生物得以存在。",
	"The following ancestries are detailed in this article:": "本文详细介绍了以下祖先的情况。",
	"{@race lucidling|Ar3|Lucidlings} are the strange, spontaneous offspring of sleeping aberrations.": "{@race lucidling|Ar3|Lucidlings}是奇怪的、自发的睡眠反常的后代。",
	"{@race sand speaker|Ar3|Sand speakers} enter the dreams of other creatures, acting as emissaries and thought thieves.": "{@race sand speaker|Ar3|Sand speakers}进入其他生物的梦境，充当使者和思想盗贼。",
	"{@race somnian|Ar3|Somnians} are imaginative dream architects. Appearing as starry silhouettes, somnians craft illusions and assume nightmarish forms.": "{@race somnian|Ar3|Somnians}是富有想象力的梦想建筑师。他们以星辰般的剪影出现，制造幻觉，呈现出梦魇般的形态。",
	"Ssussothis slowly awoke from its decennial nap. Once again, the aboleth dreamed of that pathetic warrior and his dopey grin. What an embarrassment it was to dream of defeat at the hands of such a lighthearted fool. Ssussothis' anger leached from the aberration's body, filling the cavern with a hideous squelching sound.": "Ssussothis从它十年一次的小睡中慢慢醒来。Aboleth再次梦到那个可悲的战士和他那呆呆的笑容。梦见自己败在这样一个轻率的傻瓜手里，是多么的难堪啊。Ssussothis的愤怒从畸形人的身体中渗出，使洞穴里充满了狰狞的挤压声。",
	"The aboleth sluggishly opened its three eyes to find an intruder standing in a pool of ectoplasmic goo. The slimy, grey-skinned humanoid was beaming at Ssussothis, a wide gap-toothed grin stretching across a chinless face. The being's three vertically stacked red eyes blinked, and they waved a fleshy, sword-shaped tentacle.": "阿波尔斯迟钝地睁开了它的三只眼睛，发现一个入侵者站在一滩外质粘液中。这个黏糊糊的、灰色皮肤的人形生物正对着苏苏斯微笑，一个宽大的齿隙笑容在一张没有下巴的脸上延伸。这个人的三只垂直叠加的红眼睛眨动着，挥舞着一条肉质的、剑形的触手。",
	"\"Are you my mama?\" asked the eager lucidling.": "\"你是我的妈妈吗？\"急切的鲁西德林问。",
	"When sleep meets the sleepless, lucidlings are born. The unwanted offspring of immortal aberrations, lucidlings burst forth from the dreams of ancient aboleths and other alien beings, where uncontrolled thoughts beget life.": "当睡眠与无眠者相遇，清醒者诞生了。不朽的反常者的不受欢迎的后代，清醒者从古老的亚伯拉罕和其他外星生物的梦中迸发出来，在那里不受控制的思想产生了生命。",
	"No two lucidlings are alike. When the Vizier of the Court of All Flesh, Lord Rall, inverts the fragile flesh of a dozen enemies, his dreams might be so filled with their screams that it inadvertently spawns several lucidlings at once. A trained eye—one unfortunate to have seen a plethora of aberrations—can identify the lucidlings' lineage based on physical characteristics, but similarities among lucidlings with the same parent are typically far and few between. Though all lucidlings are humanoids, one lucidling might be smooth and spindly with a single piercing eye, while their \"sibling\" could be twice as large, with a purple leathery hide speckled with tiny barbs.": "没有两个清醒的人是相同的。当 \"万物之庭 \"的大臣Rall勋爵颠覆了十几个敌人脆弱的肉体时，他的梦中可能充满了他们的尖叫声，以至于无意中同时孕育了几个清醒者。一双训练有素的眼睛--不幸的是，他已经看到了大量的反常现象--可以根据身体特征来识别清醒者的血统，但同一父母的清醒者之间的相似之处通常是很少的。虽然所有清醒者都是人形，但一个清醒者可能是光滑的、骨瘦如柴的，只有一只刺眼的眼睛，而他们的 \"兄弟姐妹 \"可能是两倍大，有紫色的皮革皮，上面有细小的倒刺。",
	"In addition to physical features, lucidlings inherit diluted personality traits from their creators. A lucidling descended from a dominating aboleth may be described as controlling or manipulative, while the child of a gibbering mouther might be loquacious and greedy. Despite these patterns in their psyche, lucidlings are hardly replicas of their creators. They are unique individuals, shaped by their environments, choices, and experiences.": "除了身体特征外，清醒者从他们的创造者那里继承了稀释的人格特征。一个由统治者阿波勒斯的后代所生的清醒者可能被描述为控制欲或操纵欲，而一个胡言乱语的人的孩子则可能是健谈和贪婪的。尽管他们的心理有这些模式，但Lucidlings几乎不是其创造者的复制品。他们是独特的个体，由他们的环境、选择和经历塑造而成。",
	"Paranoid progenitors reduce many lucidlings to dust shortly after their inception, but not all aberrations attempt to destroy their accidental handiwork—and those that do are not always successful. A surviving lucidling might become a dutiful minion, bizarre apprentice, or loyal spy. Others manage to escape their creators' lairs before the aberrations wake.": "偏执的祖先在他们诞生后不久就将许多Lucidlings化为灰烬，但并不是所有的反常者都试图摧毁他们意外的手艺，而且那些反常者并不总是成功。一个幸存的Lucidling可能会成为一个尽职的奴仆、奇怪的学徒或忠诚的间谍。其他人则设法在反常者醒来之前逃离他们创造者的巢穴。",
	"Lucidlings begin life as fully-formed adults with alien appearances and little or no concept of organized humanoid society. Once exposed to the outside world, curiosity overwhelms most lucidlings, driving them to partake in the best and worst experiences life has to offer.": "Lucidlings开始时是一个完全成形的成年人，有着外星人的外表，对有组织的类人社会几乎没有概念。一旦接触到外部世界，好奇心压倒了大多数清醒者，驱使他们参与生活中最好和最坏的经历。",
	"Every lucidling is born with a vestige, an organic structure that points to their otherworldly heritage. The Lucidling Vestiges table contains examples of physical features you can add to give your character a more alien appearance. These structures have no effect on your character's game statistics.": "每个Lucidling出生时都有一个遗迹，一个指向他们异世界遗产的有机结构。Lucidling遗迹表包含了一些身体特征的例子，你可以添加这些特征来使你的角色具有更多的外貌。这些结构对你的角色的游戏统计数据没有影响。",
	"Eyestalks": "眼轴",

	"Extra pair of tiny arms": "额外的一对小臂",
	"Shriveled wings": "萎缩的翅膀",
	"External organs": "外部器官",
	"Lucidlings are genderless. They typically adopt the name of their parental aberration, followed by a suffix synonymous with the muse of their birth dream. Lucidlings often choose an abbreviated nickname to accommodate creatures who do not speak their progenitor's language.": "梦游者是没有性别的。他们通常采用他们父母反常的名字，然后再加上一个与他们出生时的梦想的缪斯同义的后缀。Lucidlings通常选择一个缩写的绰号，以适应那些不会说其祖先语言的生物。",
	"Albezuro-Gel (Abegel), Krizeth-Gel (Krigel), Krizeth-Mawpt (Kript), Marthekh-Khan (Markh), Xapkiro-Laxx (X-Lax)": "Albezuro-Gel (Abegel), Krizeth-Gel (Krigel), Krizeth-Mawpt (Kript), Marthekh-Khan (Markh), Xapkiro-Laxx (X-Lax)",
	"Your lucidling character has the following traits.": "你的 \"清醒 \"角色有以下特征。",
	"Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.": "你的智力分值增加2，你选择的另一项能力分值增加1。",
	"Lucidlings reach maturity at the time of their creation, but their lifespans vary wildly. Some lucidlings live less than a year, while others are seemingly immortal. Lucidlings do not age.": "Lucidlings在被创造时达到成熟，但他们的寿命有很大的不同。有些Lucidlings的寿命不到一年，而另一些则似乎是不朽的。琉璃人不会衰老。",
	"As products of unchecked creativity, lucidlings tend towards chaotic alignments.": "作为不受约束的创造力的产物，Lucidlings倾向于混乱的排列组合。",
	"Lucidlings range from 4 to 7 feet tall and weigh between 100 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.": "路西丁的身高在4到7英尺之间，体重在100到300磅之间。你的体型是中等。",
	"Your base walking speed is 30 feet.": "你的基本行走速度是30英尺。",

	"As an action, you can assume an otherworldly form, choosing from the following options. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes, until you die, or until you revert to your normal form as a bonus action. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "作为一个动作，你可以采取一个异世界的形式，从以下选项中选择。这种转变持续10分钟，直到你死亡，或者直到你作为一个额外动作恢复到你的正常形态。一旦你使用这个特性，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	" You sprout a pair of tentacles, arms, or similar appendages. Each appendage has a reach of 10 feet and can lift a number of pounds equal to three times your Strength score. You can use a bonus action on your turn to perform a simple task with one of your appendages, such as: lift, push, pull, or interact with an object or creature; grapple a Large or smaller creature; or make an unarmed strike. Your GM might allow you to perform other tasks with your appendages.": " 你长出一对触手、手臂或类似的附属物。每个附肢的伸长距离为10英尺，可以举起相当于你力量值三倍的重量。你可以在你的回合中使用一个额外的动作，用你的一个附肢执行一个简单的任务，例如：举起、推、拉或与一个物体或生物互动；抓住一个大型或小型生物；或进行一次徒手攻击。你的总经理可能会允许你用你的附肢执行其他任务。",
	"Your appendages can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.": "你的附属肢体不能挥舞武器或盾牌，也不能做任何需要手动精确度的事情，例如使用工具或魔法物品或执行法术的躯体部分。",
	"You gain a flying speed equal to": "你获得的飞行速度等同于",
	"your walking speed and can hover.": "你的行走速度，并能悬停。",
	"You secrete a viscous magical slime, granting you the ability to breathe underwater and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.": "你分泌出一种粘稠的魔法粘液，赋予你在水下呼吸的能力，以及相当于你步行速度的游泳速度。",
	"In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal poison damage equal to half your level to the attacker.": "此外，当一个生物用近身攻击击中你时，你可以用你的反应对攻击者造成相当于你等级一半的毒伤害。",
	"You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If the receiving creature can speak at least one language, it can respond to you telepathically.": "你可以与你周围30英尺内你能看到的任何生物进行心灵感应。如果接收的生物能说至少一种语言，它可以用心灵感应来回应你。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech.": "你可以说、读、写普通话和深奥语。",
	"Azita clasped her hands together and leaned forward on her oaken desk inquisitively. It was littered with books, notes, and drawings devoted to sleep and the power of the subconscious. \"What did you dream of last night?\" she asked the young prince.": "阿兹塔双手合十，好奇地向前靠在她的橡木办公桌上。书桌上堆满了专门讨论睡眠和潜意识力量的书籍、笔记和图画。\"你昨晚梦见了什么？\"她问小王子。",

	"Formed from the sands of island shores in the astral sea, sand speakers look like sauntering humanoid sculptures stretched from dyed glass. They infiltrate the minds of creatures in their sleep, acting as prophetic messengers and so-called \"thought thieves\" on behalf of extraplanar entities.": "沙语者由星海中岛屿海岸的沙子形成，看起来就像用染色玻璃拉伸而成的闲庭信步的人形雕塑。他们在睡梦中潜入生物的头脑，代表星外实体充当预言使者和所谓的 \"思想盗贼\"。",
	"Before recorded time, archangels warred with aberrations at the bounds of the multiverse, where astral sands slowly spilled into nothingness. Led by Oneirus the Eternal, the angels sought to drive back the unfathomable evils and prevent the aberrations from disrupting their divine works. During a cataclysmic battle, Oneirus' radiant fire scorched the iridescent sand, giving it form and infusing it with life. Humanoid figures of molten glass, the original sand speakers, rose from the astral desert and knelt before the archangel.": "在有记录的时间之前，大天使们在多元宇宙的边界与反常者交战，那里的星沙慢慢溢出到虚无之中。在永恒者奥尼鲁斯的领导下，天使们试图赶走深不可测的邪恶，并防止畸变者扰乱他们的神圣工作。在一场灾难性的战斗中，奥尼鲁斯的光芒之火烧毁了五彩缤纷的沙子，赋予其形态并注入了生命。熔化玻璃的人形，即最初的沙子扬声器，从星际沙漠中升起，跪在大天使面前。",
	"Oneirus invited each sand speaker to pledge themselves to a righteous cause and return with the angels to the celestial host. Many accepted and became prophetic messengers, while others decided to explore their newfound freedom, wandering the sands like interplanar nomads. Some, however, were tempted by unintelligible whispers emanating from the Abyss, rejecting Oneirus in favor of maleficent beings lurking beyond the sands.": "奥尼鲁斯邀请每一位沙地上的演讲者保证自己的正义事业，并与天使们一起返回天国。许多人接受并成为预言家的使者，而其他人则决定探索他们新发现的自由，像星际游牧者一样在沙地上游荡。然而，有些人被来自深渊的难以理解的耳语所诱惑，拒绝了阿尼鲁斯，而选择了潜伏在沙地之外的邪恶的生命。",
	"Despite their smooth complexion, sand speakers are composed of millions of tiny granules suffused with cosmic energy. Sand speakers travel the multiverse in service to meddling archfey, imprisoned fiends, and forgotten deities hoping to reassert their godhood. Some conduct divine outreach as heralds, while others tempt sleeping souls on behalf of ambitious devils. A sand speaker might appear before a belligerent zealot, chastising their actions in hopes of averting a holy crusade without a single casualty.": "尽管他们有着光滑的肤色，但沙语者是由数百万个充满宇宙能量的小颗粒组成的。说沙子的人在多元宇宙中旅行，为爱管闲事的大帝、被囚禁的恶魔和希望重新确立其神性的被遗忘的神祗服务。有些人作为使者进行神圣的宣传，有些人则代表野心勃勃的魔鬼诱惑沉睡的灵魂。一个沙子演讲者可能会出现在一个好战的狂热者面前，责备他们的行为，希望能避免一场没有任何伤亡的神圣的十字军。",
	"Some sand speakers, called thought thieves, engage in subconscious subterfuge, slipping into the minds of influential figures to steal precious secrets or plant the seed of an idea in hopes of prompting action in the material world. Expert thought thieves are graceful shadows, sneaking past the defenses of well-guarded noble estates, fortified prisons, and the magically warded towers of paranoid mages.": "有些说沙子的人，被称为思想盗贼，从事下意识的潜规则，溜进有影响力的人物的脑海中，窃取珍贵的秘密，或埋下思想的种子，希望能促使他们在物质世界采取行动。思想盗贼专家是优雅的影子，可以偷偷溜过守卫森严的贵族庄园、坚固的监狱和偏执狂法师的魔法防御塔的防线。",
	"The ability to dream walk is both a blessing and a curse. Distrusted as violators of the unconscious mind, sand speakers carry a stigma wherever they go.": "梦中行走的能力既是一种祝福也是一种诅咒。作为无意识思维的侵犯者，讲沙子的人不被信任，无论他们走到哪里都带着污名。",
	"Sand speakers typically relocate after appearing in a creature's dreams to avoid scrutiny. While some prefer hidden lairs on the outskirts of civilizations or adopt a regular disguise, most sand speakers are vagabonds, constantly on the move to minimize the odds of being recognized by a former target. Sand speaker societies are rare, and take the form of caravans or mobile camps.": "说沙子的人在出现在一个生物的梦中后，通常会迁移到其他地方，以避免被审查。虽然有些人喜欢隐藏在文明郊区的巢穴中，或者采用常规的伪装，但大多数讲沙子的人都是流浪者，不断地移动以减少被以前的目标认出的几率。说沙子的人的社会是罕见的，采取大篷车或移动营地的形式。",
	"By the time a sand speaker reaches maturity, they have seen dozens of dreams. However, a sand speaker's ability comes at a price: the first time that they dream walk, they can no longer have dreams of their own. Instead, they must live vicariously through the fantasies of others, beholding the wonder of the unrestrained mind but tasting none of its fruits for themselves.": "当一个讲沙子的人达到成熟的时候，他们已经看到了几十个梦。然而，说沙子的人的能力是有代价的：他们第一次做梦的时候，就不能再有自己的梦。相反，他们必须通过别人的幻想来生活，看到不受约束的心灵的奇迹，但自己却无法品尝到它的成果。",
	"Dream walks inspire sand speakers to explore the real world. To a sand speaker, each dream is an illusion—alluring, foreign, and hollow. They observe delicious foods, wondrous curiosities, and breathtaking landscapes imagined by dreamers. Sand speakers chase these visions during their waking hours, venturing out into the world in search of iconic landmarks, gourmet recipes, and famous individuals that inspired dreams they've visited.": "梦境的行走激发了说沙子的人对现实世界的探索。对讲沙子的人来说，每个梦都是一种幻觉--诱人的、陌生的、空洞的。他们观察美味的食物，奇妙的奇物，以及做梦者所想象的令人惊叹的风景。说沙子的人在醒着的时候追逐这些幻觉，到外面的世界寻找标志性的地标、美食食谱和激发他们所访问的梦的名人。",
	"Though sand speakers lose the ability to have new dreams after their first dream walk, they can still relive old ones. In sand speaker culture, these old dreams are symbols of fate called omens. Typically, the same omen recurs for weeks, months, or years. A sand speaker has no control over which omen they experience each night and always recalls it perfectly upon waking. Like tarot card readings or casting runes, a sand speaker draws meaning from their omen, believing it holds some hidden clue to their destiny.": "尽管讲沙子的人在第一次梦境行走后就失去了做新梦的能力，但他们仍能重温旧梦。在讲沙子的人的文化中，这些旧梦是命运的象征，称为预兆。通常情况下，同一个预兆会重复出现几周、几个月或几年。说沙子的人无法控制他们每晚经历的预兆，而在醒来后总是能完美地回忆起它。就像塔罗牌读数或施放符文一样，说沙子的人从他们的预兆中汲取意义，相信其中有一些关于他们命运的隐藏线索。",
	"The Sand Speaker Omens table displays possible omens for your character, while the Sand Speaker Quirks table contains specific quirks to help you portray them.": "沙地演讲者预兆表显示了你的角色可能出现的预兆，而沙地演讲者怪癖表则包含了具体的怪癖，以帮助你描绘他们。",

	"Sand speakers reach maturity at the same rate as humans. On average, they live about 300 years.": "说沙子的人达到成熟的速度与人类相同。平均而言，他们的寿命约为300年。",
	"Sand speakers tend towards lawful neutral. Tapping into the subconscious minds of other creatures gives sand speakers a sense of perspective. They see creatures in their most vulnerable states, witnessing their brightest hopes, deepest desires, and darkest fears.": "说沙子的人倾向于合法的中立。挖掘其他生物的潜意识给了沙语者一种视角感。他们看到生物最脆弱的状态，见证他们最光明的希望、最深的欲望和最黑暗的恐惧。",
	"Sand speakers have smooth, elongated features. They range from 6 to 8 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.": "沙喇叭有光滑、修长的特征。他们的身高在6到8英尺之间，体重在150到250磅之间。你的尺寸是中等。",

	"While in this form, you retain your walking speed and lose all other movement speeds you have. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.": "在这种形态下，你保留你的步行速度，并失去你拥有的所有其他移动速度。你可以在1英寸宽的狭窄空间内移动而不被挤压。",
	"You gain resistance to nonmagical damage. You can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. You can't attack or cast spells.": "你获得对非魔法伤害的抵抗。你不能说话或操纵物体，你所携带或持有的任何物体都不能被丢弃、使用或以其他方式进行互动。你不能攻击或施放法术。",
	"Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "一旦你使用这个特质，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",

	"The Dream Realm does not abide by the laws of the material world, so sand speakers hoping to gain information must think outside the box. For example, in real life, the ability to read—be it a book, a sign, even a clock—is not processed in the subconscious part of the human brain, therefore we are unable to read in our dreams. While a dozing creature might believe it's reading, a sand speaker inside the dream may come across inscriptions written in gibberish or books filled with blank pages. Similarly, creatures in dreams are products of the dreamer's subconscious and may look or sound differently than who the dreamer understands them to be—if they have a face at all! Knowing this information can help GMs and players convey dreams as distinct, vivid experiences with unique problems for characters to solve.": "梦境不遵守物质世界的法则，所以希望获得信息的说沙人必须跳出框框思考。例如，在现实生活中，阅读的能力--无论是一本书、一个标志，甚至是一个钟，都不在人脑的潜意识部分处理，因此我们在梦中无法阅读。虽然打瞌睡的生物可能认为自己在阅读，但在梦中的沙子说话者可能会遇到用胡言乱语写的碑文或充满空白页的书。同样，梦中的生物也是做梦者潜意识的产物，它们的外观或声音可能与做梦者所理解的生物不同--如果它们有一张脸的话！了解这些信息可以帮助游戏规则的制定者们更好地理解他们。了解这些信息可以帮助GM和玩家将梦境表达为独特、生动的经历，并为角色解决独特的问题。",

	"You cause a tree to sprout from an unoccupied space of solid ground that you can see within range. When you cast the spell, you determine the height of the tree, which can be a maximum of 20 feet tall.

When the duration ends or when you have used all seven colors, the bow vanishes.": "一旦你发射了一支箭，相应的颜色就会从弓上消失，而且在这个特定的施法过程中，你不能再选择这种颜色。当持续时间结束或当你用完所有七种颜色时，弓就会消失。",

	"{@i Violet}. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blinded condition. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal Planes.)": "{@i Violet}. 拯救失败时，目标会被弄瞎。然后它必须在你的下一个回合开始时做一个智慧救赎动作。拯救成功会结束失明状态。如果救赎失败，该生物会被传送到由GM选择的另一个存在平面，并且不再失明。(通常情况下，处于非本位面的生物会被放逐回家，而其他生物通常会被送入星界或虚空界）。",
	"You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to shrink for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is not worn or held. If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.": "你使范围内的一个生物或一个你能看到的物体在持续时间内缩小。选择一个生物或一个未被穿戴或持有的物体。如果目标是一个不愿意的生物，它可以做一个 \"宪法救赎\"。如果成功，该法术就没有效果。",
	"The target becomes Tiny, shrinking to a height of 1 inch, and it weighs 1 pound, unless it already was smaller or weighed less before the spell was cast. If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once. Until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1 damage. If the creature was not already Tiny before this spell was cast, its speed is halved for the duration.": "目标变得很小，缩减到1英寸高，重量为1磅，除非它在施法前已经更小或重量更轻。如果目标是一个生物，它所穿戴和携带的所有东西都会随之改变大小。受影响的生物掉落的任何物品都会立刻恢复到正常大小。在咒语结束之前，目标在力量检查和力量投掷方面有劣势。目标的武器也会缩小，以符合其新的尺寸。当这些武器被缩小时，目标用它们的攻击会造成1点伤害。如果该生物在施放此法术前还没有被缩小，它的速度会在持续时间内减半。",
	"You grow a pair of metallic, feathered wings. These wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.": "你长出一对金属质地的羽翼。这些翅膀在持续时间内给予你60英尺的飞行速度。当咒语结束时，如果你还在高空，你会坠落，除非你能阻止坠落。",
	"While the spell is active, you can use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack with the wings against a target within 10 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. The wings are magical weapons.": "当咒语激活时，你可以使用一个额外动作，用翅膀对你10英尺内的目标进行一次近身法术攻击。一旦命中，目标将受到2d6的砍伤。翅膀是神奇的武器。",
	"As a bonus action, you can choose to end the spell and launch the metallic feathers in a 60-foot cone of razor-sharp blades. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "作为一个额外的行动，你可以选择结束咒语，并将金属羽毛发射到一个60英尺的尖刀锥体中。锥体中的每个生物都必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作。蓄力失败时，生物会受到3d8的穿刺伤害，蓄力成功则受到一半的伤害。",
	"You exchange your own living heart for the finely crafted heart of stone you used for the spell's material component. Your living heart can then be stored or hidden anywhere you like, but must remain within 1 mile of you to keep the spell active, where it continues to beat for the duration. While your heart is removed in this manner, you automatically succeed on all death saving throws. If you die, but your original heart remains intact, you gain a new body with a new stone heart in 1d10 days and return to life with all your hit points. Your new body appears within 5 feet of your original heart.": "你用你自己的活体心脏换取你用于咒语物质成分的精巧的石头心脏。然后你的活体心脏可以被存放或藏在你喜欢的任何地方，但必须保持在你周围1英里的范围内，以保持咒语的有效性，在那里它将继续跳动。当你的心脏以这种方式被移走时，你的所有死亡挽救动作都会自动成功。如果你死了，但你原来的心脏仍然完好无损，你会在1d10天内获得一个带有新石心的新身体，并以你所有的命中率恢复生命。你的新身体出现在你原来心脏的5英尺范围内。",
	"While you possess a stone heart, you lose the ability to heal naturally during a short or long rest, and can only restore hit points through magical healing. If your living heart is damaged or destroyed, you are instantly slain.": "当你拥有一颗石心时，你在短期或长期的休息中会失去自然愈合的能力，只能通过魔法治疗恢复命中率。如果你的活体心脏被损坏或摧毁，你会被立即杀死。",
	"You can choose to end the spell as a bonus action. The spell ends automatically if you travel more than 1 mile from your living heart. When the spell ends, your own living heart instantly returns to its proper place, and the stone heart is destroyed.": "你可以选择结束咒语作为一个额外动作。如果你离开你的活人心脏超过1英里，咒语会自动结束。当咒语结束时，你自己的活人心脏会立刻回到它应有的位置，而石心则被摧毁。",
	"You animate the corpse of a creature that has died within the past day whose body is still intact. For the duration, you restore a semblance of life to the deceased creature, putting the reanimated subject in a half-life state but not truly reconnecting the soul to the body.": "你使在过去一天内死亡的生物的尸体复活，而该生物的身体仍然是完整的。在持续时间内，你会恢复已故生物的生命迹象，使复活的对象处于半生状态，但不会真正将灵魂与身体重新连接。",
	"The reanimated creature has 1 hit point and can move as they could in life. In this state, a target is unable to attack, use spells, or take similarly complex actions. If the creature could speak in life, it has the ability to do so, though its memory is cloudy, making it difficult for the subject to remember even the basic details of its past life. During a limited interaction, the animated corpse could be passed off as alive, but extended conversation reveals something is amiss. A creature that uses its action to examine the body can determine that it is not alive with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.": "复活的生物有1个命中点，可以像生前一样移动。在这种状态下，目标无法攻击、使用法术或采取类似的复杂行动。如果该生物在生前能说话，它就有能力这样做，尽管它的记忆是模糊的，使得目标很难记住甚至是其过去生活的基本细节。在有限的互动过程中，这具动画的尸体可以被当作活的，但长时间的交谈会发现有些不对劲。一个使用其行动来检查尸体的生物可以通过对你的法术救赎DC进行成功的智力（调查）检查来确定它不是活的。",
	"The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent reanimated does not count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead, and the reanimated body does not decay.": "这个法术也有效地延长了使目标人物起死回生的时间限制，因为复活的天数不计入复活等法术的时间限制，而且复活的身体也不会腐烂。",
	"A creature reanimated in this way is not undead, and it can be resurrected by any spell that would return a fully dead creature to life.": "以这种方式复活的生物不是不死之身，它可以被任何能让完全死亡的生物恢复生命的法术复活。",

	"by Sam Mannell": "作者：Sam Mannell",
	"A wizard leans over the edge of their magic carpet, casting a bolt of fire at a fleeing, winged assassin. A ranger rides her trusty griffon companion, twisting around the dragonfire licking at their heels. The party braces for impact as a roc plummets from the clouds, smashing into their stolen airship!": "一个巫师俯身在他们的魔毯边缘，向一个逃跑的带翅膀的刺客投掷火弹。一个游侠骑着她可靠的狮鹫伙伴，绕过舔着他们脚跟的龙火。当一只大鹏鸟从云层中坠落，砸向他们偷来的飞艇时，一行人做好了冲击的准备。",
	"In a combat-focused roleplaying game with flying creatures and vehicles, you're bound to take a fight to the skies sooner or later. While precise tactical positioning can be valuable on solid ground, many players and GMs find that judicious creature placement in three dimensions slows down the action, right when things are getting interesting!": "在一个以战斗为重点的角色扮演游戏中，如果有飞行生物和车辆，你迟早会把战斗带到天空中。虽然精确的战术定位在坚实的地面上很有价值，但许多玩家和管理员发现，在事情变得有趣的时候，明智的生物在三维空间中的位置会减缓行动的速度。",
	"Aces High is a lightweight ruleset for aerial combat, aimed at replicating the high-octane action of a cinematic dogfight. Aerial combat doesn't happen a lot in roleplaying games, because it tends to be more cumbersome and less fun than combat on the ground—but in many stories that aren't RPGs, aerial battles happen all the time! The aim of Aces High is to emulate the thrill of those stories, and make you want to put more aerial combat in your games.": "Aces High是一个轻量级的空战规则集，旨在复制电影中斗狗的高亢动作。空中战斗在角色扮演游戏中并不经常发生，因为它往往比地面战斗更麻烦，更没有乐趣--但在许多不是RPG的故事中，空中战斗一直在发生！Aces High的目的是模仿这些故事的快感，并使之成为一种新的游戏方式。Aces High的目的是模仿这些故事的快感，让你想在你的游戏中投入更多的空战。",
	"These rules are strictly aimed at combat encounters that take place entirely in the air. No half measures.": "这些规则严格针对完全在空中发生的战斗遭遇。没有半点措施。",
	"The cornerstone of Aces High is the flight modifier, a number attached to your character which functions like an ability modifier, and is used to modify d20 rolls. This includes ability checks, called flight checks, and saving throws, called flight saving throws.": "Aces High的基石是飞行修改器，一个附加在你的角色上的数字，其功能类似于能力修改器，用于修改D20卷。这包括能力检查（称为飞行检查）和救赎（称为飞行救赎）。",
	"The two factors that determine your flight modifier are size and flying speed, because the flight modifier is based on the real-life concept of the thrust-to-weight ratio. You can find a vehicle or creature's flight modifier on the flight modifiers table on the next page.": "决定你的飞行修改器的两个因素是尺寸和飞行速度，因为飞行修改器是基于现实生活中的推重比概念。你可以在下一页的飞行修改器表格中找到一个车辆或生物的飞行修改器。",
	"When riding a mount, use the mount's flight modifier. When piloting a vehicle, use the vehicle's flight modifier. When you gain a flying speed, whether through a spell such as fly, or the use of a magic item such as wings of flying, calculate your own flight modifier.": "当乘坐坐骑时，使用坐骑的飞行修改器。当驾驶车辆时，使用车辆的飞行修正值。当你获得飞行速度时，无论是通过法术如飞行，还是使用魔法物品如飞行之翼，都要计算你自己的飞行修正值。",
	"If you're the helmsman of a vehicle, directing a mount, or flying under your own steam, you're considered a pilot. Only pilots use a flight modifier.": "如果你是车辆的舵手，指挥坐骑，或以自己的力量飞行，你就被认为是一个飞行员。只有飞行员才使用飞行修改器。",
	"If you're riding along on a mount, vehicle, or magic item, but you're not directly responsible for piloting, then you're a passenger, and you don't use any flight modifier. Don't worry! You can still take actions during the action phase.": "如果你骑在坐骑、车辆或魔法物品上，但你不直接负责驾驶，那么你就是一个乘客，而且你不使用任何飞行修改器。别担心！你仍然可以在行动期间采取行动。你仍然可以在行动阶段采取行动。",

	"Aces High aims to be fast, simple, and fun. Don't worry about the precise positioning of combatants, the direction they are flying, or their fly speed! You can safely assume that combatants are constantly changing direction while chasing each other, automatically making the best maneuvers they can—the only thing you need to know is whether or not they have a clear shot at each other. Measurements, including altitude (see \"Altitude Die\"), are abstractions when using these rules.": "Aces High的目标是快速、简单和有趣。不要担心战斗人员的准确定位，他们的飞行方向，或他们的飞行速度！你可以安全地假设战斗人员在追逐对方时不断改变方向，自动做出他们能做的最好的动作。你可以有把握地认为，战斗人员在追逐对方时不断改变方向，自动做出他们能做的最好的机动动作--你唯一需要知道的是他们是否有机会清楚地射中对方。在使用这些规则时，测量，包括高度（见 \"高度模\"），都是抽象的。",
	"Using minis can be useful to help visualize the scene, but Aces High doesn't use a grid at all.": "使用迷你模型可以帮助可视化场景，但Aces High根本没有使用网格。",
	"While you can defeat an opponent by dealing damage to them, your primary objective in an Aces High encounter is to ground the enemy. Knocking your foes out of the sky is the fastest path to victory!": "虽然你可以通过对对手造成伤害来击败他们，但你在Aces High遭遇战中的首要目标是击倒敌人。将你的敌人击落在空中是通向胜利的最快途径!",
	"When two or more combatants commit to aerial combat, all pilots involved must Scramble!": "当两个或更多的战斗人员承诺进行空战时，所有参与的飞行员必须争分夺秒!",
	"Scrambling sets the turn order and the starting altitude of each combatant. Much like standard initiative, combatants roll a d20 and add their flight modifier to the result, with higher results taking their turns first. However, unlike initiative, all combatants have 10 seconds to roll as many times as they want, trying to get the best possible result. Once the timer is up, everyone must use the result they have in front of them!11 Players using an online platform to play are able to roll much faster than normal, so consider cutting the time limit in half when playing online.": "争夺设定了回合顺序和每个战斗人员的起始高度。和标准的主动权一样，战斗人员掷出一个D20，并在结果上加上他们的飞行修饰符，结果越高，他们的回合就越快。然而，与主动权不同的是，所有战斗人员都有10秒钟的时间，想掷多少次就掷多少次，试图获得尽可能好的结果。一旦计时结束，每个人都必须使用他们面前的结果！11 使用在线平台进行游戏的玩家能够比正常情况下更快地掷骰子，所以在在线游戏时，可以考虑将时间限制减半。",
	"When flying any mount or vehicle, only the pilot needs to Scramble. Passengers don't need to Scramble—they take actions when their pilot does.": "在驾驶任何坐骑或车辆时，只有飞行员需要争分夺秒。乘客不需要争分夺秒--当他们的飞行员采取行动时，他们也会采取行动。",
	"When a new combatant joins (or rejoins!) the fray, they Scramble without a timer, and use the first result they roll.": "当一个新的战斗人员加入（或重新加入！）战场时，他们的争夺没有计时器，并使用他们滚动的第一个结果。",
	"To find your opening altitude, don't add your flight modifier; all you need to do is look at the number on your d20, and match it to the corresponding Altitude on the Opening Altitude Table.": "要找到你的开局高度，不要加上你的飞行修改器；你所需要做的就是看你的D20上的数字，并将其与开局高度表上的相应高度相匹配。",
	"Altitude is vital to both success and survival in an Aces High encounter. We track it on the Altitude Die, a d6 that you can place next to your character sheet or your mini. The higher the number, the higher you are!": "在Ace High游戏中，海拔对于成功和生存都是至关重要的。我们用海拔模子来追踪它，这是一个D6，你可以放在你的角色表或你的迷你模型旁边。数字越大，你就越高!",
	"Being above your target is an enormous tactical advantage that allows you to use the sun or other environmental conditions to make tracking your movement extremely difficult. A pilot is too engaged with flying to spend precious seconds craning their neck to squint at the sky! You have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets of a higher Altitude than you, unless you're a passenger.": "在你的目标上方是一个巨大的战术优势，它允许你利用太阳或其他环境条件来使追踪你的运动变得极其困难。飞行员太专注于飞行了，不可能把宝贵的时间花在伸长脖子看天空上。对比你海拔高的目标，你在攻击卷上有劣势，除非你是个乘客。",
	"As you might expect, this also means you have advantage on attack rolls against targets with an Altitude below yours. This advantage applies whether you're a pilot or a passenger.": "正如你所期望的，这也意味着你在对海拔低于你的目标进行攻击时有优势。无论你是飞行员还是乘客，这个优势都适用。",
	"Once everyone has Scrambled and set their Altitude Die, play begins. On each player's turn there are two phases; the stunt phase—in which you try to create angles of attack, and the action phase—in which you try to use them!": "一旦每个人都完成了争夺并设置了他们的高度模，游戏就开始了。在每个玩家的回合中，有两个阶段；特技阶段和行动阶段，在特技阶段，你要努力创造攻击角度，在行动阶段，你要努力使用这些角度",
	"When your stunt phase starts, you roll a number of d4s equal to your flight modifier (minimum of 1 die). These are your Stunt Dice. You can spend them to alter your Altitude, or spend them to create Angles.": "当你的特技阶段开始时，你要掷出与你的飞行修饰符相等数量的D4（最小为1个骰子）。这些是你的特技骰子。你可以用它们来改变你的高度，或者用它们来创造角度。",
	"Unspent dice carry over to the next round. When your next stunt phase starts, roll a new set of d4s, and add them to the pile you had left over.": "未用完的骰子会延续到下一轮。当你的下一个特技阶段开始时，掷出一组新的d4，并把它们加到你剩下的那一堆。",
	"Your stunt phase ends when you say it does, or when you have no more Stunt Dice to spend.": "你的特技阶段在你说的时候结束，或者在你没有更多的特技骰子可以使用时结束。",
	"Once you're more comfortable with this system, you may want to turn up the heat. Try adding a 60-second timer to the stunt phase to add some pressure, if everyone in your group is okay with it. What's more important to you; adjusting your Altitude, or creating an Angle? Choose fast!": "一旦你对这个系统更加适应，你可能想把热度提高。试着在特技阶段增加一个60秒的计时器，以增加一些压力，如果你们小组的每个人都能接受的话。对你来说，什么更重要；是调整你的高度，还是创造一个角度？选择快速!",
	"When you roll your Stunt Dice, the results are somewhat like a hand of cards. To create an Angle, you must match three-of-a-kind, or three-in-a-row. For example, 3-3-3 and 2-3-4 are both viable Angles. When you match and subsequently spend these dice, you gain an extra action to use during the action phase!": "当你掷出你的特技骰子时，其结果有点像一副牌。要创造一个角度，你必须匹配三张相同的牌，或三排。例如，3-3-3和2-3-4都是可行的角度。当你匹配并随后花费这些骰子时，你会获得一个额外的行动，在行动阶段使用。",
	"If you're fast enough, it's possible to create multiple Angles and therefore access more than the normal amount of actions in one turn, but only the fastest of creatures and vehicles can do this regularly! Generally speaking, it's more likely that a monster that's in their element when flying—like a roc, or a couatl—is going to be fast enough to really bend the action economy, but that's by design; dogfighting a roc should feel like a legendary encounter!": "如果你的速度够快，就有可能创造出多个角度，从而在一个回合内获得超过正常数量的行动，但只有最快的生物和车辆才能经常这样做！一般来说，在飞行时更有可能的是怪物，如大鹏或美洲狮，它们的速度快到足以真正改变行动经济。一般来说，更有可能的是，在飞行时处于它们的元素中的怪物--如大鹏，或美洲狮--会快到足以真正弯曲行动经济，但这是设计上的；与大鹏搏斗应该感觉像是一场传奇的遭遇战！这也是一种设计。",
	"The other way to spend Stunt Dice during your stunt phase is to adjust your Altitude, either by climbing or diving. In both cases, you spend a Stunt Die and then alter your Altitude by the number on the spent Stunt Die. Climbing increments the Altitude Die, and diving decrements it.": "在你的特技阶段，花费特技骰子的另一种方式是调整你的高度，可以通过爬升或潜水。在这两种情况下，你都要花费一个特技骰子，然后按照花费的特技骰子上的数字改变你的高度。攀登会增加高度骰，而潜水会减少高度骰。",
	"You can only spend a Stunt Die to adjust your Altitude": "你只能花一个特技模子来调整你的海拔高度",
	"once during your stunt phase.": "在你的特技阶段有一次。",
	"When you choose to dive, the potential energy you've stored is transformed into momentum you can use to supercharge your speed! When you decrement your Altitude Die by the result of a spent Stunt Die, you can add that amount as a bonus to one of the following:": "当你选择下潜时，你所储存的势能会转化为动力，你可以用它来提高你的速度 当你用一个特技模子的结果减少你的高度模子时，你可以把这个量作为奖励加到以下一项中。",
	"1. Your AC.": "1. 你的空调。",
	"2. Your attack and damage rolls.": "2. 你的攻击和伤害卷。",
	"You keep these bonuses until the start of your next turn.": "你保持这些奖励，直到你下一回合开始。",
	"Climbing above 6 on the Altitude Die means you've passed over into High Altitude. Upgrade your Altitude Die to a d12! For every point of Altitude you have above 6, you gain an extra Stunt Die to roll at the start of your stunt phase. You can't climb above Altitude 12.": "攀登到海拔模的6以上意味着你已经进入高海拔地区。将你的高度模升级为D12! 你的海拔高度每超过6点，你就获得一个额外的特技骰子，在特技阶段开始时滚动。你不能爬到海拔12以上。",
	"However, any creature that ends its turn in High Altitude must make a Constitution saving throw to withstand the thinning air and plummeting temperature! Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed.": "然而，任何在高海拔地区结束其回合的生物都必须进行一次体质拯救，以抵御稀薄的空气和骤降的温度。不需要呼吸的生物会自动成功。",
	"The DC for a High Altitude Constitution saving throw is the number on your Altitude Die x 2.": "高海拔地区的体质拯救动作的DC是你的海拔模子上的数字×2。",
	"Any creature that fails this saving throw falls unconscious. This may or may not mean you start Freefalling, but it's likely that it does—an unconscious creature cannot fly, and if you're piloting a vehicle, you've probably passed out at the wheel.": "任何失败的生物都会陷入昏迷。这可能意味着你开始自由落体，也可能不意味着你开始自由落体，但很可能意味着--失去意识的生物不能飞行，如果你在驾驶车辆，你可能已经在方向盘上昏迷了。",
	"You can repeat this saving throw in order to regain consciousness at the end of each of your turns, but the DC for repeated saving throws remains the same no matter your Altitude.": "你可以在每个回合结束时重复这个拯救动作以恢复意识，但无论你的海拔高度如何，重复拯救动作的DC都是一样的。",
	"See \"Freefall\" below for more details.": "更多细节见下文 \"自由落体\"。",
	"If your Altitude die shows a 1, then you are in Low Altitude, and just like High Altitude, it's dangerous. If your Altitude die ever decrements below 1, or you're in Freefall and you end your turn in Low Altitude, you hit the ground. And probably explode.": "如果你的高度模子显示为1，那么你就处于低空，就像高空一样，这很危险。如果你的高度模子递减到1以下，或者你处于自由落体状态，并且你在低海拔地区结束你的回合，你就会落地。而且可能会爆炸。",
	"If you end your turn in Low Altitude and you're not Freefalling, make a Flight saving throw to avoid colliding with the ground, ocean, rooftops, lava, etc. The DC for this saving throw depends on the terrain, and so is determined by the GM. The sample encounter at the end of this article contains an example.": "如果你在低海拔地区结束你的回合，并且你没有自由落体，请做一个飞行蓄力动作以避免与地面、海洋、屋顶、熔岩等相撞。这个自救动作的DC取决于地形，因此由GM决定。本文末尾的遭遇样本包含一个例子。",
	"Whenever you hit the ground, either by failing the Low Altitude saving throw, or by decrementing below 1 on the Altitude die, you immediately take falling damage, as described under \"Freefall.\"": "每当你落地时，无论是因为低海拔救赎失败，还是因为海拔模子递减到1以下，你都会立即受到坠落伤害，如 \"自由落体 \"中所述。",
	"After your stunt phase ends, play moves into the action phase. During the action phase, you and any passengers with you on your mount or vehicle can take one action (except the Dash action) and one additional action for each Angle you created during the stunt phase. Passengers can also move about their vehicles, such as the deck of an airship, but pilots, mounts, and vehicles have used their movement during the stunt phase.": "在你的特技阶段结束后，游戏进入行动阶段。在行动阶段，你和你的坐骑或车辆上的任何乘客可以采取一个行动（除了冲刺行动），以及你在特技阶段创造的每个角度的一个额外行动。乘客也可以在他们的车辆上移动，例如在飞艇的甲板上，但飞行员、坐骑和车辆在特技阶段已经使用了他们的移动。",
	"If you're a pilot, you can use an action to allow your mount or vehicle to take an action. This differs from how mounted combat works on the ground, chiefly because while airborne, you're not using a movement speed or measuring distance in feet, both of which the core mounted combat rules heavily rely on.": "如果你是一个飞行员，你可以使用一个行动来让你的坐骑或车辆采取一个行动。这与地面上的骑兵作战方式不同，主要是因为在空中时，你不使用移动速度或以英尺为单位测量距离，而这两者都是核心骑兵作战规则所严重依赖的。",
	"Ranged attacks and spells dominate in aerial combat. When you create an Angle, you can assume that you are putting yourself at an optimal distance to make any ranged attack you like.": "射程攻击和法术在空战中占主导地位。当你创造一个角度时，你可以假设你把自己放在一个最佳的距离，以进行你喜欢的任何远程攻击。",
	"Melee weapons can be used so long as your Altitude dice matches your targets. If your weapon has the reach property, you can also make melee attacks against a target one point of Altitude away. Note that the normal Altitude rules for advantage and disadvantage still apply to reach weapons!": "只要你的高度骰子与你的目标相符，就可以使用近战武器。如果你的武器有伸手的属性，你也可以对距离你1点高度的目标进行近战攻击。请注意，正常的高度优势和劣势规则仍然适用于伸手可及的武器。",
	"Whenever you, your mount, or your vehicle is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw and takes damage as a result, decrement your Altitude by 1. Losing Altitude to damage can only occur once per turn.22 Note that this says once per turn, not once per round. For instance, each party member gets a chance to take the wyvern down a peg, but only once!": "每当你、你的坐骑或你的车辆被攻击击中或蓄力失败并因此而受到伤害时，你的高度就会减少1。例如，每个党员都有机会将狼人打倒在地，但只有一次。",
	"Damage is typically applied to a mount or vehicle first, because it's a much bigger target to hit in the midst of the chaos. A GM is free to rule that pilots and passengers can be directly targeted by attacks, potentially with disadvantage.": "伤害通常会首先作用于坐骑或车辆，因为在混乱中它是一个更大的目标。GM可以自由地规定，飞行员和乘客可以直接成为攻击的目标，可能会有不利因素。",
	"If your vehicle or mount is reduced to 0 hit points and you don't have a flying speed, you and any passengers without a flying speed begin Freefalling (see below).": "如果你的车辆或坐骑的命中率降至0，并且你没有飞行速度，你和任何没有飞行速度的乘客开始自由落体（见下文）。",
	"While reduced to less than half your hit points, you're Going Down, and your Altitude decreases by 1 at the end of each of your turns, no matter what.": "当你的命中率降低到一半以下时，你会被击倒，并且你的高度在每个回合结束时都会减少1，无论如何。",
	"When you score a critical hit on an attack, it's a direct hit! The target rolls a d4, and drops that many points of Altitude immediately.": "当你在一次攻击中取得关键命中时，它是一个直接命中! 目标掷出d4，并立即下降那么多的高度。",
	"The barbs of a grapnel bite into your hull! Two dragons lock onto each other with glittering jaws and teeth!": "弹片的倒刺咬住了你的船身! 两条龙用闪亮的颌骨和牙齿锁定对方!",
	"Sometimes things get really up close and personal. When you want to grapple a target, it works as usual; in place of a melee attack. A GM might rule that grappling is necessary for a boarding action, if vehicles are involved!": "有时事情会变得非常近距离和个人化。当你想抓捕一个目标时，它像往常一样工作；代替近战攻击。如果涉及到车辆，GM可能会规定抓捕对于登船行动是必要的。",
	"It's up to the GM to decide whether or not grappling an opponent makes you both start Freefalling. A griffon grappling a pegasus might be grounds for such a ruling, but an airship firing a grappling hook probably wouldn't!": "这要由GM来决定，抓捕对手是否会使你们都开始自由落体。狮鹫抓捕飞马可能是这种裁决的理由，但飞艇发射抓钩可能就不会了！\"。",
	"Sometimes you bite off more than you can chew—we've all been there—but how do you escape a foe that's got you out maneuvered in the air? Turning tail and running isn't so easy when they've zeroed in on you.": "有时候，你咬的东西比你能咬的多--我们都有过这样的经历--但你如何逃脱一个在空中把你耍得团团转的敌人？当他们盯上你的时候，掉头就跑就不那么容易了。",
	"As an action, you can decide to Bug Out. To do this, announce your intentions, and pray. You now have a giant target on your back, and every bandit in the sky is free to take a potshot at it!": "作为一项行动，你可以决定逃亡。要做到这一点，宣布你的意图，并祈祷。现在你的背上有一个巨大的目标，天空中的每一个强盗都可以自由地对它进行射击！你的目标是什么？",
	"When you Bug Out, an enemy may use their reaction to make a Flight check against your passive Flight score, which is 10 + your Flight modifier. On a success, they can make a single spell or weapon attack against you.": "当你 \"虫鸣 \"时，敌人可以用他们的反应对你的被动飞行分数进行飞行检查，这个分数是10+你的飞行修改因子。如果成功，他们可以对你进行一次法术或武器攻击。",
	"If you survive the onslaught, you escape, find somewhere to land, and live to fly another day.": "如果你能在攻击中幸存下来，你就能逃脱，找到地方降落，并能活到下一天。",
	"If a fireball spell, dragon's breath weapon, or other area of effect is used during an Aces High encounter, you can use your best judgement regarding which targets it can affect, or the rules for adjudicating areas of effect in the core rulebook, meant to guide GMs using theater-of-the-mind.": "如果在Aces High遭遇战中使用了火球术、龙息武器或其他效应区，你可以使用你对它能影响哪些目标的最佳判断，或者核心规则手册中的效应区裁决规则，意在指导GM使用心魔剧场。",
	"As a basic guideline, creatures with an altitude difference of 3 or more cannot be included in the same area of effect.": "作为一个基本准则，高度差为3或更多的生物不能包括在同一效果区。",
	"The core rules say that creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall, up to a maximum of 20d6 bludgeoning damage.": "核心规则说，生物每跌落10英尺就会受到1d6的重击伤害，最多达到20d6的重击伤害。",
	"In Aces High, normal rules for falling damage don't apply. You always take 20d6 bludgeoning damage when you hit the ground, because you're usually falling from extreme heights. A combatant flies so fast that touching the ground at all, outside of a controlled landing, is likely to spell disaster. Of course, a GM is free to rule that falling from Low Altitude deals less damage—something like 10d6, or 5d6—but these rulings should be made on instinct to keep the action moving!": "在《王牌高空》中，正常的坠落伤害规则并不适用。当你落地时，你总是受到20d6的重击伤害，因为你通常是从极高的高度坠落。一个战斗人员飞得如此之快，以至于在受控着陆之外，根本不可能接触到地面，这很可能会带来灾难。当然，GM可以自由地裁定从低空坠落造成的伤害较小--比如10d6，或者5d6--但是这些裁定应该是根据本能做出的，以保持行动的连续性",
	"This damage is applied to your mount or vehicle first if you have one (because they hit the ground first!), and leftover damage is then applied to you and your passengers. The pilot and passengers take the same amount of damage; it is not divided between them.": "如果你有坐骑或车辆的话，这些伤害会先作用于你的坐骑或车辆（因为它们会先落地！），然后剩余的伤害会作用于你和你的乘客。飞行员和乘客受到的伤害是一样的；伤害不会在他们之间分割。",
	"If this seems harsh, consider the following; falling out of the sky is literally the worst case scenario when committing to aerial combat. Also note that this level of lethality becomes much less pronounced for player characters somewhere between levels 8 and 10, or once they have over 70 hit points total, as they're less likely to suffer instant death.": "如果这看起来很残酷，请考虑以下情况；从天上掉下来简直是投入空中战斗的最坏情况。还要注意的是，这种程度的致命性对于8到10级的玩家角色来说变得不那么明显，或者一旦他们的总命中率超过70点，因为他们不太可能遭受即时死亡。",
	"Even characters who are basically gods have succumbed to the unyielding wrath of gravity, but that said, those who want a bit of danger at lower levels should embrace it!": "即使是那些基本上是神的角色也屈服于重力的不屈之怒，但话虽如此，那些想在较低水平上有一点危险的人应该拥抱它！\"。",
	"Good question! Objects (and creatures!) in the real world hit terminal velocity after about twelve seconds of falling. For our purposes, that's 2 rounds.": "问得好! 现实世界中的物体（和生物！）在下落约12秒后达到终点速度。就我们的目的而言，那是2个回合。",
	"When in Freefall, decrement your Altitude die once on round one, twice on round two, and then three times every round after that.": "当处于自由落体状态时，在第一轮减少你的高度模子一次，在第二轮减少两次，然后在之后的每一轮减少三次。",
	"This gives allies a window to Dive and save you! In order to do this, an ally must have a lower Altitude than you, and then must use an action to make a Flight check and snatch you from the jaws of death. The DC for this check is up to the GM, and could depend on how fast you are falling, how close to the ground you are, and even whether or not you need to be plucked from the deck of a failing airship!": "这给了盟友一个跳水救你的机会。为了做到这一点，盟友必须有一个比你更低的海拔高度，然后必须用一个行动来进行飞行检查，把你从死亡的边缘抢过来。这个检定的DC由GM决定，可能取决于你坠落的速度，你离地面的距离，甚至是你是否需要从失败的飞艇的甲板上被拉出来。",
	"A GM could also use the speed at which a creature or vehicle is falling to help determine how much Freefall damage they take if no one is able to rescue them. For example, round one is 5d6, round two is 10d6, and round three and beyond is 20d6!": "GM也可以使用生物或车辆下落的速度来帮助确定如果没有人能够救他们，他们会受到多少自由落体的伤害。例如，第一轮是5d6，第二轮是10d6，第三轮及以后是20d6！这就是自由落体。",
	"Gut Moves are like reactions—you can make them whenever you want in response to a trigger, so long as you have some Stunt dice lying around unspent. Gut Moves do not use your Reaction.": "内脏动作就像反应--只要你有一些特技骰子未用，你就可以在任何时候对一个触发器做出反应。内脏动作并不使用你的反应。",

	"Next, think about whether or not there are any extra features of the area that could come into play. In a fantasy game, you might encounter tremendous storms, angry cloud giants, or floating islands!

	"This encounter is built for a group of at least four characters of 10th-15th level. Two characters begin the encounter flying on the back of one young silver dragon. Only two Medium-sized characters can comfortably ride the dragon—one is a pilot, the other is a passenger.": "这个奇遇是为一组至少4个10-15级的角色而设的。两个角色开始在一条年轻银龙的背上飞行。只有两个中等身材的角色可以舒适地乘坐龙--一个是驾驶员，另一个是乘客。",

	"The Krystalum family enjoys a life of luxury. Spoilt and entitled, the family members treat others like tools, and pay no regard to those who can't benefit them.": "克里斯托鲁姆家族享受着奢侈的生活。娇生惯养，有权有势，家庭成员把别人当做工具，对那些不能为他们带来好处的人不闻不问。",
	"The youngest Krystalum, Diana, despises the way her family behaves, and isn't afraid to tell them so. Because of this, the rest of the Krystalums act like she doesn't exist, and when they have to acknowledge her, they treat her like one of the servants. While her family's disregard was once a cause for grief, it's become an advantage, allowing Diana to do what she wants to without attracting the attention of her parents and siblings.": "最小的Krystalum，戴安娜，鄙视她的家人的行为方式，并且不怕告诉他们。正因为如此，Krystalums家族的其他人就像她不存在一样，当他们不得不承认她时，他们把她当作仆人之一。虽然她的家人对她的漠视曾经是一个悲伤的原因，但它已经成为一个优势，允许戴安娜做她想做的事而不引起她父母和兄弟姐妹的注意。",
	"Using {@i From Earth}, a book from the family library, Diana summoned a xorn, a type of earth elemental that eats precious metals and jewels. She torments the rest of her family with a series of thefts, while keeping her new friend happy by giving them a source of food. She doesn't intend to physically hurt her family. Instead, she wants to make a ruckus, something that can't be ignored, to attract the attention of people who might be able to help her get away from her family.": "黛安娜用家族图书馆的一本书（%0%）召唤出了一只xorn，一种吃贵重金属和珠宝的土元素。她用一系列的偷窃来折磨她的家人，同时通过给他们提供食物来源来让她的新朋友开心。她并不打算在身体上伤害她的家人。相反，她想制造混乱，制造一些不能被忽视的东西，以吸引那些可能会帮助她离开家人的人的注意。",
	"The adventure begins when the characters arrive at Krystalum Manor. There, Lord Reuben explains the situation before allowing the characters to speak with the other family members and examine some of the manor's rooms.": "冒险开始于人物到达克里斯托鲁姆庄园的时候。在那里，鲁本勋爵解释了情况，然后允许人物与其他家庭成员交谈，并检查庄园的一些房间。",
	"The characters' investigation leads them to Diana Krystalum, who is so overlooked that the rest of the family didn't even think of mentioning her earlier. It's up to the party to decide whether they help her accomplish her plan, or tell her family the truth.": "人物的调查使他们找到了戴安娜-克里斯托鲁姆，她是如此的被忽视，以至于家族中的其他人甚至没有想到早些时候会提到她。是帮助她完成计划，还是告诉她的家人真相，这要看当事人的决定。",
	"I wrote {@i A Diamond In The Rough} with the intent of creating a roleplay-focused adventure that uses an investigation to pace and drive the story. Because of this, I didn't design the mystery to be particularly complex. For me, it's more a question of how long it takes for characters to figure out what all the pieces are, and what they do once they have all the information.": "我写{@i A Diamond In The Rough}的目的是创造一个以角色扮演为中心的冒险，用调查来引导和推动故事的发展。正因为如此，我并没有把谜题设计得特别复杂。对我来说，这更多的是一个问题，即角色需要多长时间来弄清楚所有的碎片，以及一旦他们得到所有的信息后，他们会做什么。",

	"Reuben is a gruff man who expects people to know what he wants, even if he doesn't explicitly spell out his desires.": "鲁本是一个粗暴的人，他希望人们知道他想要什么，即使他没有明确说明他的愿望。",
	"As someone who expects to always get his way, he doesn't like to make compromises. Moreover, he hates small talk and lengthy conversations with those he deems below his station. If the characters ask too many questions, he becomes irritated and accuses them of not being up to the task.": "作为一个期望总是能得到自己的方式的人，他不喜欢做出妥协。此外，他讨厌与那些他认为低于他地位的人进行小范围的交谈和冗长的谈话。如果人物问的问题太多，他就会变得很烦躁，指责他们不能胜任工作。",

	"Micah becomes easily flustered if the characters hint at breaking Reuben's rules, and tries to discourage them as much as possible.

If asked whether he would steal to supplement the fact that he is underpaid, he hesitates before stating he would not.": "虽然麦加没有偷任何珠宝，但这些偷窃行为无疑使他意识到犯罪确实是有代价的。如果被问及他是否会通过偷窃来补充他工资不足的事实，他犹豫了一下才说他不会。",

The xorn focuses on foes who deal a lot of damage, using its Earth Glide ability to appear right next to the target.": "xorn专注于保卫戴安娜，并优先攻击任何接近她的人。然而，这个元素并没有死亡的愿望。xorn专注于造成大量伤害的敌人，使用它的大地滑翔能力出现在目标旁边。",

	"Lord Reuben listens intently, concealing any emotions behind cold professionalism, to what the characters tell him. At first, Lord Reuben doesn't believe Diana has the courage to pull off so many robberies and laughs if the adventurers present this theory without evidence. If the characters present proof that Diana was behind the thefts, he briskly gives them their promised 200 gp each and dismisses them without thanks or indication of how he intends to punish Diana.": "鲁本勋爵认真地听着，把任何情绪都掩盖在冷酷的职业精神后面，听着这些人物告诉他的话。起初，鲁本勋爵不相信戴安娜有勇气进行这么多的抢劫，如果冒险者提出这个没有证据的理论，他就会笑。如果这些人物提出证据证明戴安娜是这些盗窃案的幕后黑手，他就轻描淡写地给他们承诺的每人200金币，然后不加感谢地解雇他们，也不说明他打算如何惩罚戴安娜。",
	"A visibly distressed Micah leads the adventurers out of the manor. He clearly wants to protest the situation but won't stand up for the characters unless they also object. Lord Reuben calls the guards if the adventurers outstay their welcome or change their mind on siding with him (see \"Stand Your Ground\").": "一个明显感到痛苦的麦加带领冒险家们走出了庄园。他显然想抗议这种情况，但除非他们也反对，否则不会站出来为角色说话。如果冒险家们逾期不归或者改变主意站在他一边，鲁本勋爵就会叫来卫兵（见 \"站在你的立场\"）。",

	"Xorns become hostile if mistreated or disrespected.": "如果被虐待或不被尊重，Xorns会变得充满敌意。",
	"Xorns are incredibly powerful for the level range this adventure is designed for. However, their upkeep is not cheap. Each week, a xorn must consume gemstones and precious metals worth a total of at least 200 gp, or it gains a level of exhaustion. Consuming an additional 200 gp worth of gemstones or precious metals reduces the xorn's exhaustion level by 1.": "对于这个冒险所设计的等级范围来说，Xorns是令人难以置信的强大。然而，它们的维护费用并不便宜。每个星期，Xorn必须消耗总价值至少200gp的宝石和贵金属，否则它就会获得一个等级的疲惫。消耗额外的价值200金币的宝石或贵金属可以使xorn的疲惫等级降低1。",
	"The Elemental Plane of Earth is brimming with more metals and jewels than xorns could ever eat in their lifetimes. Because of this, a xorn gains a strong motivation to stay on the Material Plane, such as Karat's desire to protect Diana, it wants to return to its home plane.": "地球元素界充斥着更多的金属和珠宝，是xorn们一生中都吃不完的。正因为如此，一个xorn获得了留在物质界的强烈动机，比如卡拉特保护戴安娜的愿望，它想回到自己的主位面。",
