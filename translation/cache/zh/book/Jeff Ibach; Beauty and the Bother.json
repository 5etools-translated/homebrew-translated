	"This is an article my wife wrote nearly 20 years ago. At the time it grew out of how I was handling her character's high Charisma score. We discussed how if I favored her, as the DM's wife, it would be uncool. That's when it hit her - Charisma can be a blessing and a curse! Quickly putting fingers to keyboard she wrote this to give me inspiration for making her character's high Charisma interesting, not just a benefit. Enjoy!": "这是我妻子近20年前写的一篇文章。当时，它源于我如何处理她的角色的高魅力得分。我们讨论了如果我偏爱她，作为DM的妻子，这将是不酷的。这时，她突然想到--魅力可以是一种祝福，也可以是一种诅咒！她迅速地用手指敲击键盘，写下了这段话。她迅速地把手指放在键盘上，写下了这段话，给我灵感，让她的角色的高魅力变得有趣，而不仅仅是一种好处。请欣赏!",
	"P.S. If you are going to pull these on your new Bard or Sorcerer player or whatever, at least let them know that their Charisma score can sometimes be a bother, and give them the heads up you intend to make it quite a ride!   {@i -Jeff Ibach}": "P.S. 如果你要对你的新吟游诗人或巫师玩家或其他什么人使用这些方法，至少让他们知道他们的魅力得分有时会是一个麻烦，并给他们提个醒，你打算让他们有一个相当的旅程   {@i -Jeff Ibach}",
	"What can a good DM do when one of his players wants to put their highest score in Charisma? The following are some encounter ideas for the DM to place in any city or village to make it an interesting and dangerous place for the character with the good looks and charm, not to mention their adventuring companions.": "当他的一个玩家想把他们的最高分放在魅力上时，一个好的DM可以做什么？以下是DM在任何城市或村庄中的一些遭遇想法，以使其成为一个对具有良好外表和魅力的角色来说有趣而危险的地方，更不用说他们的冒险同伴了。",
	"During play, the PC with the high charisma score should be made aware that they are noticed. Just a few simple statements by the DM that indicate the NPCs take notice of the PC will do. The following are a few examples of other suggestions to indicate that the NPCs have noticed the high score.": "在游戏过程中，应该让拥有高魅力分数的个人意识到他们被关注。DM只需说几句简单的话，表明NPC注意到了该PC，就可以了。以下是其他建议的几个例子，以表明NPC注意到了高分。",
	"{@b Apparel.} The clothes and accessories that the PC wears could serve as a mobile advertisement for a local shop or several shops. The tailor makes the PCs clothes in return that the PC mentions his shop whenever anyone asks about their clothing. The tailor may ask the PC for the cost of materials if the PC takes advantage of this deal and re-quests clothing made of silk, velvet or other costly materials.": "{@b Apparel.} PC所穿的衣服和配件可以作为当地商店或几个商店的移动广告。裁缝为PC制作衣服，作为回报，只要有人问起他们的衣服，PC就会提到他的商店。如果PC利用这个交易，重新要求用丝绸、天鹅绒或其他昂贵的材料制作衣服，裁缝可以向PC索要材料费用。",
	"{@b Courtesy.} NPCs may offer their place in line or open a door to an attractive PC. This may also happen to an aver-age looking character, but will happen more often to the more comely PC by members of the opposite sex.": "{@b Courtesy.}NPC可能会给一个有吸引力的PC提供他们的位置，或者给他开门。这种情况也可能发生在长相普通的角色身上，但会更多地发生在更有魅力的PC身上，由异性成员提供。",
	"{@b Extras.} When the PC has purchased an item, whether food or supplies, the vendor may offer the PC an extra apple or a few more iron spikes. This can be done by the NPC to promote good business or show that he is inter-ested in the PC on a more personal level.": "{@b Extras.}当PC购买了一件物品，无论是食物还是用品，卖家可能会给PC提供一个额外的苹果或几个铁钉。这可以由NPC来做，以促进良好的业务，或者表明他在更多的个人层面上对PC感兴趣。",
	"{@b Heads turning.} The PC with the high charisma may be content if the DM mentions that the heads of merchants and customers are turning as he walks through the mar-ket. The DM can describe specific NPCs as being dis-tracted, such as the pick pocket forgets to pick the pocket, the merchant staring at the PC doesn't notice the thief stealing from his cart, and the occasional pedestrian who trips because she is so busy looking at the PC that he doesn't watch where she is going.": "{@b Heads turning.}如果DM提到当他走过市场时，商人和顾客的头都在转动，那么拥有高魅力的PC可能会感到满足。DM可以描述特定NPC的失神，比如扒手忘记了扒口袋，盯着PC的商人没有注意到小偷从他的车上偷东西，偶尔有行人被绊倒，因为她忙着看PC，他没有注意她的去向。",
	"{@b Smiles.} Some people seem to be more inclined to smile a greeting at an attractive person, instead of speaking. Smil-ing back would have various effects, depending on the NPC in question. Toll keepers may allow the PC to pass and charge nothing if the PC simply returns the smile.": "{@b Smiles.}有些人似乎更倾向于对一个有吸引力的人微笑问候，而不是说话。回以微笑会有不同的效果，取决于相关的NPC。收费员可能会允许PC通过，并且不收取任何费用，如果PC只是回以微笑的话。",
	"Depending on how well the player role-plays their charisma score, many of these drawbacks can be turned into benefits and vice versa.": "根据玩家对他们的魅力分数的角色扮演，这些缺点很多都可以变成好处，反之亦然。",
	"{@b Artistic Value.} The local artist wants to paint or sketch the PC. They may or may not have other plans once they get the PC alone. The artist will appeal to the PCs ego by using flattery and even offer money if he must.": "{@b Artistic Value.}当地艺术家想为PC作画或写生。一旦他们得到了这个人，他们可能有也可能没有其他计划。艺术家会通过奉承来吸引个人的自尊心，甚至在必要时提供金钱。",
	"{@b Appearance.} If the NPC is neat and fastidious, they would be more appreciative, or inclined to agree, with the PC having a neat and clean, if not tailored, appearance. If the PC with the high Charisma hasn't had time to ‘freshen up' before the encounter his high score will do him little good. Such things as road dust, obvious wounds, sweat, or a horse like odor could cause problems in an encounter with this type of NPC.": "{@b Appearance.}如果NPC是整洁的，他们会更欣赏，或者倾向于同意PC有一个整洁的，甚至是量身定做的外表。如果拥有高魅力的个人在遭遇之前没有时间 \"梳洗\"，他的高分对他没有什么好处。诸如道路上的灰尘、明显的伤口、汗水或像马一样的气味都会在与这种类型的NPC相遇时造成问题。",
	"{@b Children.} Children are everywhere and they are very impressionable. The children in the city may follow the PC around and ask him questions by the dozens along the way. Some of them may be spies for the local information broker or the thieves' guild. Some could have a crush on the PC and others may want to join the PC when they leave town as squires, stable hands, or messengers.": "{@b Children.}儿童无处不在，他们非常容易受到影响。城市里的孩子们可能会跟着PC到处跑，一路上问他几十个问题。他们中的一些人可能是当地信息经纪人或盗贼公会的间谍。有些人可能对PC有好感，有些人可能想在PC离开城镇时加入他们，成为侍从、马夫或信差。",
	"{@b Chivalry.} This code of conduct should also be taken into account, and good looks should play little or no part in it. The chivalric NPC would pay attention to the homely baker carrying too many loaves of bread and offer him assistance instead of catering to the attractive, unburdened PC. The PCs attention would occur after the baker is attended to, provided the PC waits that long.": "{@b Chivalry.}这种行为准则也应该被考虑在内，而好的外表应该很少或根本不发挥作用。富有骑士精神的NPC会注意那个拿着太多面包的家庭面包师，并向他提供帮助，而不是迎合那个有吸引力的、没有负担的PC。在面包师被照顾好之后，NPC的注意力才会出现，只要NPC等待那么久。",
	"{@b Competition for PC.} Two rival suitors are vying for the PCs attention. One or both of them gets the idea that slaying a dragon (or other dangerous creature) would impress the PC and sets out to do it. The NPCs could also hold contests and beg the PC to oversee them and judge who has won. The winner of these competitions will expect the PC on their arm thereafter. The loser may shadow the couple or attempt to do harm to the winner or to the PC, depending on their nature.": "{@b Competition for PC.} 两个敌对的追求者正在争夺PC的注意力。他们中的一个或两个有了这样的想法：杀死一条龙（或其他危险的生物）会给PC留下深刻的印象，于是就开始行动了。NPC也可以举行比赛，并恳求PC监督他们，判断谁赢了。这些比赛的获胜者此后会期待PC在他们的手臂上。失败者可能会跟踪这对夫妇，或者试图对胜利者或PC造成伤害，这取决于他们的本性。",
	"{@b Competition for NPC.} Members of the same sex may view the PC with a mix of envy or concern over what their spouses, or prospective spouses, may think of the new beauty in town, thus reversing any reaction bonuses and instead making them penalties. Alternately, the local center of attention may aid the PC and his friends in order to get them out of town as quickly as possible.": "{@b Competition for NPC.}同性的成员可能会用羡慕或担心他们的配偶或未来的配偶对镇上的新美女的看法来看待这个人，从而扭转了任何反应奖金，反而使他们受到惩罚。另外，当地的焦点人物可能会帮助PC和他的朋友，以便让他们尽快离开小镇。",
	"{@b Crush.} Everything the PC says or does is very important to the NPC with a crush. The NPC may follow the PC around or offer to join her on a quest. Small gifts of flowers or sweets may be offered. If the NPC is rebuffed in the slightest a strong, negative reaction is likely to follow.": "{@b Crush.} PC所说或所做的一切对暗恋的NPC来说都非常重要。该NPC可能会跟踪PC，或提出与她一起去做任务。可以提供鲜花或糖果的小礼物。如果NPC被拒绝了，可能会有强烈的负面反应。",
	"{@b Envy.} A jealous psychotic wants to destroy all the beauty in the world, starting with the PC. The NPC in question could be attractive or not, in which case they act out of hateful jealousy or spite.": "{@b Envy.} 一个嫉妒的精神病患者想要摧毁世界上所有的美，从个人开始。有关的NPC可能是有吸引力的，也可能不是，在这种情况下，他们的行为是出于仇恨的嫉妒或怨恨。",
	"{@b Equals.} NPCs that also have a high Charisma score may or may not be influenced by the PCs good looks or leadership. In fact, the PC may be considered a challenge or a conquest and nothing more. Alternately, the NPC may pretend to be swayed in favor of the PC, but in truth is scheming for his own benefit.": "{@b Equals.} 同样拥有高魅力分数的NPC可能会也可能不会被PC的帅气或领导力所影响。事实上，PC可能被认为是一种挑战或征服，仅此而已。另外，NPC可能会假装被动摇地支持PC，但实际上是为了自己的利益而策划的。",
	"{@b Framed.} A jealous or jilted NPC may go so far as to lie about witnessing a crime and describing the PC as the culprit. It's much easier for the NPC to convince the local militia or watch that the PC is a criminal then it is for the NPC to track the PC down themselves. This will force the guards to locate the PC and then notify the NPC in order for them to testify at the trial. The NPC will make the decision whether or not to prosecute the PC depending on the PCs reactions to the encounter.": "{@b Framed.}一个嫉妒或被抛弃的NPC可能会撒谎说目睹了一起犯罪，并把PC描述成罪犯。对NPC来说，说服当地民兵或守卫相信PC是罪犯要容易得多，而NPC自己去追踪PC则要容易得多。这将迫使守卫找到PC，然后通知NPC，让他们在审判中作证。NPC将根据PC对遭遇的反应来决定是否起诉该PC。",
	"{@b Gifts.} If the PC is not wearing or using the last gift the NPC gave them the NPC may become upset or irritated. The player should keep a log in order to keep track of which NPC in which city gave which gift.": "{@b Gifts.}如果PC没有穿戴或使用NPC给他们的最后一件礼物，NPC可能会变得不高兴或被激怒。玩家应该保持一个日志，以便跟踪哪个城市的哪个NPC给了哪个礼物。",
	"{@b Loot.} Stolen items could be given as gifts to impress the PC. These gifts are most likely in the form of jewelry, but may include cloaks, scarves, hats, gloves, or minor magical items. These items will most likely not have obvious visible signs of ownership (such as monograms or names embroidered on them), but may have a Wizard Mark or an invisible clue that the original possessor left to prove ownership.": "{@b Loot.} 偷来的物品可以作为礼物来打动PC。这些礼物最有可能是珠宝，但也可能包括斗篷、围巾、帽子、手套或小型魔法物品。这些物品很可能没有明显可见的所有权标志（如绣在上面的字母或名字），但可能有一个巫师标记或原始拥有者留下的无形线索来证明所有权。",
	"{@b Mutual support.} If an NPC gives the PC a gift or a favor and the PC takes advantage (or seems to) of that generosity and offers nothing in return, it's a good possibility that the next time the party visits that town, or a nearby town, they may not be well received. The stream of gifts will not last forever, and the PCs reputation for taking them and offering nothing in exchange could spread to others in the same business, social class, or profession.": "{@b Mutual support.}如果一个NPC给了PC一个礼物或一个忙，而PC利用（或似乎利用）这种慷慨而不提供任何回报，那么很有可能在下一次聚会访问那个城镇或附近的城镇时，他们可能不会受到欢迎。礼物流不会永远持续下去，而接受礼物而不提供任何交换的PC的名声可能会传播给同一行业、社会阶层或职业的其他人。",
	"{@b Notoriety.} Being attractive makes the PC stand out. People will remember an attractive or unusual PC before they remember any other. NPCs will still be talking about the beautiful PC even after they have left the town, and this makes it easier for others to track them, or companions known to travel with them, and place the PC at the scene of any crime or disturbance. Jilted NPCs will have no difficulty finding the PC unless they takes measures to disguise or hide themselves, and likely negating any reaction bonuses.": "{@b Notoriety.}有吸引力使PC脱颖而出。人们会在记住任何其他的人之前记住一个有吸引力的或不寻常的人。即使在他们离开城镇之后，NPC仍然会谈论美丽的PC，这使得其他人更容易追踪他们，或已知与他们一起旅行的同伴，并将PC置于任何犯罪或骚乱的现场。被抛弃的NPC将不难找到PC，除非他们采取措施来伪装或隐藏自己，并可能否定任何反应奖励。",
	"{@b Reputation.} Fame can be a double-edged sword. One ugly rumor isn't likely to hurt the PC, but if a jealous NPC makes it a point to spread several in the right places, the PCs fans could become rivals or even enemies. A smart NPC would use past events as examples, give the credit for good deeds elsewhere, or use partial truths to make the PC look untrustworthy. Repairing a damaged reputation could take hard work, plenty of time, and lots of coin.": "{@b Reputation.} 名声可以是一把双刃剑。一个丑陋的谣言不可能伤害到个人，但如果一个嫉妒的NPC在适当的地方散布几个谣言，个人的粉丝就会成为对手甚至敌人。聪明的NPC会利用过去的事件作为例子，将功劳归于其他地方，或者利用部分事实使PC看起来不值得信任。修复受损的声誉可能需要艰苦的工作、大量的时间和大量的钱财。",
	"{@b Simple minds.} A beggar, local drunk, or the village idiot likes the PC. They follow the PC everywhere and offer small tokens of affection, usually bits of broken glass, shiny rocks, or picked flowers. The poor NPC will spend whatever money he comes across to buy things for the PC and possibly even steals something to give as a gift. If the NPC or his gifts are rejected, the townsfolk may begin to view the PC in a negative light for abusing him. If the PC encourages the NPC then he could also be accused of taking advantage of the 'simple soul.'": "{@b Simple minds.} 一个乞丐、当地的酒鬼或村里的白痴喜欢这个人。他们到处跟着PC，并提供小的感情信物，通常是碎玻璃、闪亮的石头或采摘的花朵。这个可怜的NPC会花他所遇到的任何钱来为PC买东西，甚至可能偷一些东西来作为礼物。如果NPC或他的礼物被拒绝了，镇民们可能会因为虐待NPC而开始对他有负面看法。如果PC鼓励NPC，那么他也可能被指责为利用了这个 \"简单的灵魂\"。",
	"{@b Station.} Nobles are likely to be swayed by a PC that is at least of the same station. With few exceptions, NPCs are not likely to be attracted to or influenced by a PC of a lesser social class. Buying a title or acquiring wealth are something else altogether.": "{@b Station.}贵族可能会被一个至少是相同地位的人所动摇。除了少数例外，NPC不可能被一个社会地位较低的PC所吸引或影响。购买头衔或获得财富则完全是另一回事。",
	"{@b Wisdom.} The DM may allow the NPC a Wisdom or Insight check to determine if they has fallen for the PC. There could be any number of situations that might offer resistance to seduction and allure attempts. Also, if the NPC has a description as havinga a thing for the opposite sex, they would be familiar with seduction attempts and be able to spot when it is being used against them.": "{@b Wisdom.} DM可以允许NPC用智慧或洞察力检查来确定他们是否已经爱上了PC。可能有很多情况会对勾引和引诱的尝试提供阻力。另外，如果NPC被描述为对异性有好感，他们就会熟悉诱惑的尝试，并且能够发现它何时被用来对付他们。",
	"A visit to the PCs hometown can have its pitfalls as well. Here are a few suggestions to make homecoming an interesting event.": "对个人家乡的访问也会有其隐患。这里有一些建议，可以使返乡成为一个有趣的事件。",
	"{@b Family Tree.} The PCs mother wants to make a good match for her child. Every time the PC visits his hometown his Mother throws a homecoming party and parades would-be suitors or brides past the PC wherever he may be during the entire stay.": "{@b Family Tree.}PC的母亲想为她的孩子做一个好的匹配。每次PC访问他的家乡时，他的母亲都会举办一个返乡聚会，在整个逗留期间，无论PC在哪里，都会有潜在的追求者或新娘从他面前经过。",
	"{@b Old Flame.} The PCs childhood sweetheart is pining for their return. Once they enter the city limits, the NPC will do just about anything to make sure the PC doesn't leave again.": "{@b Old Flame.} PC的青梅竹马对他们的回归耿耿于怀。一旦他们进入城市范围，NPC就会做任何事情来确保PC不会再离开。",
	"{@b Sibling Rivalry.} The PCs brother, sister, or cousin is always losing paramours to the more attractive family member. Depending on the NPC, this could spark anger, revenge, or just plain hatred from them.": "{@b Sibling Rivalry.} 个人的兄弟、姐妹或表亲总是被更有吸引力的家庭成员抢走伴侣。根据不同的NPC，这可能会引发他们的愤怒、报复，或者只是单纯的仇恨。",
	"Every adventuring group has its differences, but you can increase the friction by adding a few of these Charisma-based situations to the campaign.": "每个冒险小组都有其不同之处，但你可以通过在活动中加入一些基于魅力的情况来增加摩擦。",
	"{@b Deceit.} An NPC uses a romantic encounter with the charismatic PC to find out information on one of the other PCs in the group. They are looking for weaknesses, disadvantages, or fears in order to get revenge for some slight.": "{@b Deceit.} 一个NPC利用与有魅力的PC的浪漫邂逅来寻找团体中其他PC的信息。他们正在寻找弱点、劣势或恐惧，以便为某种轻视进行报复。",
	"{@b Hero Worship.} One of the NPCs that is following the charismatic PC insists on taking her side in any discussion. The NPC will also tell the other PCs that they are wrong if they disagree with his favorite PC.": "{@b Hero Worship.} 一个跟随有魅力的PC的NPC坚持在任何讨论中站在她一边。该NPC还会告诉其他NPC，如果他们不同意他最喜欢的PC，他们就是错的。",
	"{@b Infatuation.} One of the other PCs romantic interests falls for the PC with the higher Charisma. The NPC could also just feign an interest in another PC in order to get close to the more attractive one.": "{@b Infatuation.}其他PC的浪漫兴趣者中有一个人喜欢上了魅力较高的PC。NPC也可以假装对另一个PC感兴趣，以便接近更有吸引力的人。",
	"{@b Information.} The NPC may give inaccurate information in an attempt to impress the PC with what he knows. Alter-nately, he may be feeding the PC false information in or-der to gain information about her, or the group's, goals.": "{@b Information.} NPC可能提供不准确的信息，试图用他所知道的东西来打动PC。另外，他也可能向PC提供错误的信息，以获得有关她或团体目标的信息。",
	"{@b Lies.} An NPC has a wife/ husband/ jealous suitor and lies about it to spend time with or court the PC. This could have serious repercussions and cause innumerable prob-lems for the group, especially if the NPC in question has money or influence.": "{@b Lies.} 一个NPC有一个妻子/丈夫/嫉妒的求婚者，并且为了与PC相处或追求PC而撒谎。这可能会产生严重的影响，并给团体带来无数的麻烦，特别是如果这个NPC有金钱或影响力。",
	"{@b Revenge.} An NPC takes the PCs rejection (real or imag-ined) very hard and disappears. Her family hires bounty hunters to find the PC and bring him back for 'justice.' The NPCs may go so far as to charge the PC with kidnapping.": "{@b Revenge.} 一个NPC对PC的拒绝（真实的或想象的）非常不满，并消失了。她的家人雇佣了赏金猎人来寻找该NPC，并将其带回 \"正义\"。该NPC可能会以绑架罪指控该PC。",
	"{@b Status.} The local matchmaker has been trying to find a wife/husband for one of the young adults in town, and their reputation is at stake. The matchmaker may offer to give advice on clothes, hair coloring, or other suggestions to make the PC even more attractive to the NPC that they have in mind. The matchmaker may also try to coerce the other party members into helping them.": "{@b Status.}当地的媒人一直在努力为镇上的一个年轻人寻找妻子/丈夫，而他们的声誉正受到威胁。媒人可能会提供衣服、头发颜色的建议，或者其他建议，使个人对他们心目中的NPC更具吸引力。媒人也可能试图胁迫其他党员帮助他们。",
	"Overusing Enchantment and Charm spells hold their own disadvantages also. Here are a few examples.": "过度使用魔法和魅惑法术也有其自身的缺点。这里有几个例子。",
	"{@b Advantage.} If the PC uses a Friends, Suggestion or related spell on a shopkeeper the effects could be more powerful than described in the spell description. The shopkeeper could become infatuated with the PC and decide to leave the shop and follow him wherever he may be headed. The shopkeeper's family or business partners may not approve of this course of action, however.": "{@b Advantage.}如果PC对店主使用朋友、建议或相关的法术，其效果可能比法术描述中的更强大。店主可能会迷恋上PC，并决定离开商店，跟随他到他可能去的地方。然而，店主的家人或生意伙伴可能不同意这种做法。",
	"{@b Caught.} If the PC is seen casting the spell by anyone, perhaps through a window or door, the PCs reputation as a cheat will spread like wildfire, and merchants everywhere will be unwilling to do any sort of business with them. Some merchants may also keep a guard, an older child, or a spouse hidden behind a curtain to keep an eye out for thieves. If the local merchant's or thieves' guild hears about the encounter they may want to have a few words with the PC; alternately, they may also choose to refuse to do any business with the spell caster.": "{@b Caught.}如果有人看到PC施法，也许是通过窗户或门，那么PC作为骗子的名声会像野火一样传播开来，各地的商人都不愿意与他们做任何形式的生意。有些商人可能还会在窗帘后面藏着一个警卫、一个大孩子或一个配偶，以监视小偷。如果当地的商人或盗贼公会听说了这次遭遇，他们可能想和PC说几句话；另外，他们也可能选择拒绝与施法者做任何生意。",
	"{@b Discounts.} If the PC attempts to use their charm to influence the prices of goods on a regular basis, then make some of the shopkeepers the same sex as the PC or just not interested. Alternately, add the shopkeeper's husband/wife/partner to the customers in the store. This will increase the prices of goods by 10 - 50% once the spouse intervenes.": "{@b Discounts.}如果PC经常试图用他们的魅力来影响商品的价格，那么让一些店主与PC的性别相同或者只是不感兴趣。或者，将店主的丈夫/妻子/伴侣加入到商店的顾客中。一旦配偶介入，这将使商品的价格提高10-50%。",
	"{@b Fraud.} If the PC sells the NPC something fake or at an unreasonable profit the NPCs business may fold as the result. They may come looking for the PC or hire others to do so. The PC may also overhear news of the disaster from other sources. A bad reputation may follow if the NPC can prove the transaction is what caused the downfall. In order to save face as a merchant, the NPC will claim to know others who have been duped by the PC.": "{@b Fraud.}如果PC卖给NPC的东西是假的或者利润不合理，NPC的生意可能会因此而倒闭。他们可能会来找PC，或者雇佣其他人来找他。PC也可能从其他渠道听到关于灾难的消息。如果NPC能够证明这笔交易是导致倒闭的原因，那么他的名声就会变差。为了挽回商人的面子，NPC会声称认识其他被PC欺骗的人。",
	"Some ways that a PC can suffer a loss of Charisma are critical hits, fire, acid, and the like, but for the most part these can be cured by the magic. The following are a few ideas that a DM can use to create adventures based around the loss of Charisma. If the DM allows, a special quest in the name of a god of beauty or charm can be undertaken to restore the lost ability score points (one quest per point regained is recommended).": "PC遭受魅力丧失的一些方式是关键性的打击、火、酸等等，但在大多数情况下，这些都可以通过魔法治愈。下面是一些想法，DM可以用来围绕魅力的丧失创造冒险。如果DM允许，可以以美神或魅力之神的名义进行一次特殊的任务，以恢复失去的能力分数（建议每恢复一点就进行一次任务）。",
	"{@b Curses.} These can affect how people view the PC. Care and logic must be taken when using this method; since many clerics have access to the Remove Curse spell, the DM may rule that a quest or service must be undertaken to make amends to the offended party before the curse can be lifted. Gypsies giving a curse could just cause the PC to have a negative reaction adjustment when dealing with other gypsies or with everyone in general. A priest, or anyone with a devout heart, defending his faith or temple might call down a Curse on their attackers singly or as a group; requiring a service to the deity for removal.": "{@b Curses.} 这些会影响人们对个人的看法。在使用这种方法时，必须小心谨慎，讲究逻辑；由于许多神职人员都可以使用消除诅咒的咒语，所以DM可以规定，在解除诅咒之前，必须进行任务或服务，对被冒犯的一方进行补偿。吉普赛人发出的诅咒可能只是导致个人在与其他吉普赛人或一般人打交道时有负面的反应调整。牧师或任何有虔诚之心的人，为了捍卫他的信仰或寺庙，可能会单独或集体对他们的攻击者发出诅咒；需要对神灵进行服务才能解除。",
	"{@b Scrolls, weapons, or other items} the PC has could affect the reaction of any race or class, depending on who created them and why. An item that radiates evil or is created by committing an evil act may repel all good aligned NPCs, and an item with a history of offensive deeds in regard to one specific race would offend that race if overtly carried or worn by the PC. The DM should also keep in mind that those individuals that travel with the PC carrying such an item are in for no better treatment.": "{@b Scrolls, weapons, or other items}的人可能会影响任何种族或阶级的反应，这取决于谁创造了它们以及为什么。一件散发着邪恶气息的物品或通过实施邪恶行为创造出来的物品可能会排斥所有与善结盟的NPC，而一件对某一特定种族有攻击性行为的物品如果被PC公开携带或佩戴，就会冒犯该种族。DM还应该记住，那些与携带这种物品的PC一起旅行的人也不会有更好的待遇。",
	"Charisma is a relative score and every one thinks that different aspects of Charisma are appealing. Some NPCs may prefer the shy and quiet PC to the one with obvious leadership potential and a commanding personality. DMs should always keep in mind that racial differences and sex could be factors in how the NPCs view the PC with the high Charisma score. There are also some NPCs that simply cannot be seduced away from their chosen partners, duties, beliefs, or goals. Loyalty, deep abiding affection, and love are also things to consider if the PC starts attempting to influence NPCs who are already attached to another person, a set of ideals, or a code. Good roleplaying should always be taken into account, and the better the roleplaying, the better the NPC reaction.": "魅力是一个相对的分数，每个人都认为魅力的不同方面是有吸引力的。一些NPC可能更喜欢害羞和安静的PC，而不是具有明显的领导潜力和指挥性格的人。管理者应该始终牢记，种族差异和性别可能是NPC如何看待具有高魅力分数的PC的因素。也有一些NPC根本无法被引诱离开他们选择的伙伴、职责、信仰或目标。如果PC开始试图影响那些已经依附于另一个人、一套理想或守则的NPC，那么忠诚、持久的感情和爱也是需要考虑的事情。应始终考虑到良好的角色扮演，角色扮演越好，NPC的反应越好。"
