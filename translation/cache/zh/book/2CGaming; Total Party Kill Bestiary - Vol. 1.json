	"Imagine you have been running a game of 5th Edition for some time now, and the characters have passed the 10th level benchmark. As their powers increase, you find yourself struggling to field compelling foes that threaten these seemingly invincible heroes with defeat. As you scour the world in search of resources to improve your game's monsters, you find yourself spending more and more time customizing a handful of foes to meet your encounter needs. It's exhausting, time-consuming, and frustrating to see an ambush undone by a simple {@spell banishment} spell or to watch your dragon boss fight be butchered in a single turn by a paladin's critical. This pain has driven many an experienced DM to retire a campaign when it should be at its most exciting. Whether you are looking for a solution to these aforementioned problems or just need some deadly, high-level foes for your next game, the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} is here to inspire fear and shred character sheets, no matter the level of your players' characters.": "想象一下，你运行第五版游戏已经有一段时间了，而且角色已经超过了10级的基准。随着他们力量的增加，你发现自己正在努力寻找令人信服的敌人，来威胁这些看似无敌的英雄们的失败。当你在世界范围内寻找资源来改善游戏中的怪物时，你发现自己花了越来越多的时间来定制少数几个敌人以满足你的遭遇需求。看到埋伏被一个简单的{@spell banishment}法术破坏，或者看到你的龙族BOSS战在一个回合内被一个圣骑士的关键性攻击所屠戮，这是令人疲惫、耗时和沮丧的事情。这种痛苦促使许多有经验的DM在战役最精彩的时候退场。无论你是在寻找上述问题的解决方案，还是只是需要为你的下一个游戏寻找一些致命的高级敌人，(1%)都会在这里激发恐惧，粉碎角色表，无论你的玩家角色是什么级别。",
	"The creatures in this book will eat skilled adventurers for breakfast. Overconfident or careless characters will find themselves petrified by the song of a beautiful fey bird, slain instantly by an undead horseman heralding death, or the favorite chew toy of a ravenous brown dragon. These monsters will feel right at home in your game world, lurking in its darkest corners or conquering nations. Bizarre, mysterious, malevolent, or virtuous, these creatures are exclusively high-level threats suitable only for veteran heroes. Wherever these foes appear, they will make an impact, putting your players' skills to the test and contributing to a vibrant and dangerous campaign.": "本书中的生物会把熟练的冒险家当作早餐吃掉。过于自信或粗心的角色会发现自己被美丽的费伊鸟的歌声吓坏了，被预示死亡的不死骑士当场杀死，或者成为贪婪的棕龙最喜欢的咀嚼玩具。这些怪物会在你的游戏世界中感到宾至如归，潜伏在最黑暗的角落或征服国家。离奇的、神秘的、恶毒的或善良的，这些生物都是只适合老资格英雄的高级威胁。无论这些敌人出现在哪里，他们都会产生影响，使你的玩家的技能受到考验，并为一个充满活力和危险的活动作出贡献。",
	"The {@i Totally Party Kill Bestiary} contains many fantastic and wonderous creatures to delight your players. It also contains some pretty dark and gruesome critters that will do gnarly stuff to PCs who encounter them. We feel that such designs add an air of menace and danger that inspires real fear and disgust in players; emotions can be just as important to the RPG experience as fun, laughs, and thrills. However, that doesn't mean they are for everyone, and you should take the prospect of integrating creatures that push this boundary seriously. The last thing we want is to see someone walk away from your game table because of something we made, so please talk to your players about how far you can push violence against their characters using some of the monsters contained with these pages. You don't have to give everything away but do your best to ensure the people at your table don't get hurt.": "{@i Totally Party Kill Bestiary}包含了许多神奇的生物，可以让你的玩家感到高兴。它也包含一些相当黑暗和可怕的小动物，它们会对遇到它们的人做出可怕的事情。我们觉得这样的设计增加了一种威胁和危险的气氛，激发了玩家真正的恐惧和厌恶；情感对于RPG体验来说，与乐趣、笑声和惊险一样重要。然而，这并不意味着它们适合每个人，你应该认真对待整合推动这一界限的生物的前景。我们最不希望看到的是有人因为我们做的东西而离开你的游戏桌，所以请与你的玩家讨论，你可以在多大程度上使用这些页面所包含的一些怪物对他们的角色实施暴力。你不必把一切都说出来，但要尽力确保你桌上的人不会受到伤害。",

	"This book is more than just another appendix of monsters. It is a tactical assortment of brutally dangerous enemies organized into groups for optimal use by a DM. In addition to a group's combat statistics, also included are crucial tactical information to run challenging encounters, lore to seamlessly integrate these creatures into your game world, and other fun details that showcases monsters like never before. Almost every monster found within this book has a challenge rating of 10 or higher and is designed to withstand some of the greatest high-level character strengths. This is not another monster encyclopedia. This book's content is intended to be used in a way most appropriate for your game and empowers you to do so. Whether you need a villain to foreshadow a coming apocalypse or a devious threat that pushes players to their limits, this book provides you with both the statistics and the tools to make that possible.": "这本书不仅仅是另一个怪物的附录。它是一个由残酷危险的敌人组成的战术组合，将其编入DM的最佳使用范围。除了一个组的战斗统计数据外，还包括运行挑战性遭遇战的关键战术信息、将这些生物无缝融入你的游戏世界的传说，以及其他有趣的细节，以前所未有的方式展示了怪物。本书中发现的几乎每一种怪物都有10级或更高的挑战等级，并被设计用来承受一些最伟大的高级角色的力量。这不是另一本怪物百科全书。本书的内容旨在以最适合你的游戏的方式来使用，并赋予你这样做的权力。无论你是需要一个预示即将到来的天启的反派，还是需要一个将玩家推向极限的狡猾威胁，本书都为你提供了统计数据和工具，使之成为可能。",
	"Monsters within this book are compiled into thematic groups that share a background, lore, and ecology; imaginatively named \"monster groups.\" Each monster group section contains its members' combat classifications, favors and foils, which member possesses the fearsome \"TPK brand,\" lore, tactics, plot hooks, treasure, ecology, and special notes by iconic gnome bard, Talien Vos Karven. This section details the significance of each of those elements, which are critical for you to understand to achieve best results when designing encounters featuring said monsters.": "本书中的怪物被编入共享背景、传说和生态的主题组；富有想象力的命名为 \"怪物组\"。每个怪物组的部分都包含其成员的战斗分类、恩惠和衬托、哪个成员拥有可怕的 \"TPK品牌\"、传说、战术、情节钩子、宝藏、生态，以及标志性地精吟游诗人塔利安-沃斯-卡文的特别说明。本节详细介绍了这些元素的意义，这对你在设计以上述怪物为特色的遭遇战时达到最佳效果至关重要。",
	"Monsters within this book are classified into groups based on their strengths and abilities, which helps a DM easily understand their role on the battlefield. Each monster possesses a classification, with the most powerful among them being \"Elites\" who are proficient in multiple classifications simultaneously. By understanding this system of classifications, you can craft encounters that deliver on a specific challenge you want your players to experience. Do you want your heroes to dodge sniper fire as they storm a fortress? Use an artillery creature. Looking for a fearsome beast that crushes adventurers beneath its feet? Try a brute. Perhaps you need a final boss for your dungeon, in which case all you must do is find an appropriate elite. This system is a throwback to 4th Edition and helps create encounters that deliver on a specific style of play. The details of each monster classification and how to use them can be found in this section.": "本书中的怪物根据它们的实力和能力被分为不同的组别，这有助于DM轻松了解它们在战场上的作用。每个怪物都有一个分类，其中最强大的是 \"精英\"，他们同时精通多种分类。通过了解这个分类系统，你可以精心设计遭遇战，以实现你希望你的玩家体验的特定挑战。你想让你的英雄们在攻打要塞时躲避狙击手的射击吗？那就用一个炮兵生物吧。想找一个能把冒险者踩在脚下的可怕的野兽？试试蛮牛吧。也许你的地下城需要一个最后的老板，在这种情况下，你必须做的就是找到一个合适的精英。这个系统是第四版的翻版，有助于创造出能够实现特定游戏风格的遭遇战。每个怪物分类的细节以及如何使用它们可以在本节中找到。",
	"{@b Artillery.} The artillery classification indicates ranged combat specialists with abilities that can harry enemies from afar. Only the best snipers can match an artillery creature at ranged combat, which can often unleash firepower that puts even the most optimized {@spell eldritch blast}-slinging warlock to shame. Artillery creatures are vulnerable at close range, relying on allies or their own evasive abilities to stay out of melee. An artillery wants to end a fight from afar, keeping its enemies on the defensive and struggling to find cover.": "{@b Artillery.} 炮兵分类表示远程战斗专家，其能力可以从远处骚扰敌人。只有最好的狙击手才能在远程战斗中与火炮生物相提并论，它所释放的火力甚至能让最优化的{@spell eldritch blast}的术士感到羞愧。炮兵生物在近距离上很脆弱，依靠盟友或他们自己的闪避能力来远离近战。炮兵希望从远处结束战斗，让敌人处于防守状态并努力寻找掩护。",
	"{@b Brute.} Brutes are brutal melee combatants specializing in giving out as much punishment as they take. Free from player interference, a brute quickly pulverizes vulnerable characters and dismantles tactical advantages. Brutes can be counted on to take powerful hits and often do so to protect vulnerable allies or objectives. A brute seeks to be the focus of a fight, soaking up punishment and returning the favor tenfold.": "{@b Brute.}野蛮人是残酷的近战战士，专门给人以同样多的惩罚。在不受玩家干扰的情况下，野蛮人可以迅速粉碎脆弱的角色并摧毁战术优势。蛮牛可以依靠强大的攻击力，并经常这样做来保护脆弱的盟友或目标。蛮牛寻求成为战斗的焦点，吸收惩罚并十倍地回报。",
	"{@b Controller.} Controllers may not be the ones who kill a character, but they certainly make things easier for their allies. Controllers unleash debilitating effects that impair or cripple their enemies and are most effective when paired with more directly lethal creatures able to capitalize on advantages the controller provides. A controller wants to secure victory through tactical superiority, placing itself and its allies into a winning position, the tabletop equivalent of setting up a checkmate.": "{@b Controller.}控制者可能不是杀死一个角色的人，但他们肯定会让他们的盟友更轻松。控制者释放衰弱的效果，损害或削弱他们的敌人，当与能够利用控制者提供的优势的更直接致命的生物搭配时，控制者是最有效的。控制者希望通过战术优势来确保胜利，将自己和盟友置于胜利的位置，相当于在桌面上设置一个将棋。",
	"{@b Elite.} Elites are monsters with enough diverse strengths to fit multiple classifications. Only the most powerful of creatures are elites and possess few weaknesses that adventurers can exploit. As rare as they are powerful, elites can be considered bosses that lurk at the end of a dangerous dungeon or the climax of an epic adventure. An elite is often legendary and crushes opposition with overwhelming power.": "{@b Elite.} 精英是具有足够多的不同实力的怪物，适合多种分类。只有最强大的生物才是精英，并且拥有冒险者可以利用的少数弱点。精英既罕见又强大，可以被认为是潜伏在危险的地下城尽头或史诗般的冒险高潮中的老板。精英通常具有传奇色彩，以压倒性的力量粉碎对手。",
	"{@b Leader.} Leaders are masterful support creatures that aid allies with healing, magical enchantment, and other powerful buffs. Leaders rarely possess significant kill potential, focusing instead on teamwork and keeping their deadly allies in top fighting shape. Leaders need at least a few allies to help, preferring those that help them accomplish their encounter objectives. In combat, a leader alleviates harm on its allies, undoing damage with an efficiency that is nearly impossible to outclass.": "{@b Leader.} 领导者是一种高超的辅助生物，他们用治疗、魔法和其他强大的BUFF来帮助盟友。领导者很少拥有显著的杀伤力，而是专注于团队合作，使他们的致命盟友保持最佳战斗状态。领导者至少需要几个盟友的帮助，更喜欢那些帮助他们完成遭遇战目标的盟友。在战斗中，领导者会减轻对其盟友的伤害，以几乎不可能超越的效率消除伤害。",

I can see since you've purchased this tome that not only do you have impeccable literary taste but a hunger for knowledge that exceeds what most of the common folk would call \"reasonable.\" I am Talien Vos Karven, acclaimed ecologist from the College of Lore and master adventurer. It is with no small personal risk to myself and my companions that I have compiled an encyclopedia of what is, without a doubt, this world's most fearsome creatures.

While much of what you read here is objective fact, I have taken the liberty of adding my own brilliant suppositions, insights, and theories about many horrors I encountered. Should you have the misfortune of encountering one of these creatures, I hope that you survive to expand upon this knowledge. Our existence is a fragile thing, and I hope that through understanding these most dangerous forces, we can better protect that which matters most.": "欢迎你，亲爱的读者。既然你购买了这本小册子，我可以看出你不仅有无可挑剔的文学品味，而且对知识的渴望超过了大多数普通人所谓的 \"合理\"。我是塔利安-沃斯-卡文，来自传说学院的著名生态学家和冒险家大师。我冒着对自己和同伴不小的个人风险，编制了一本百科全书，毫无疑问，这是这个世界上最可怕的生物。在这本书中，你会发现我所发现的关于这些可怕敌人的所有信息，从可疑的传闻到我自己的第一手经验。虽然你在这里读到的大部分内容都是客观事实，但我还是冒昧地对我遇到的许多恐怖事件加入了我自己的精彩推测、见解和理论。如果你不幸遇到这些生物之一，我希望你能活下来，扩大这些知识。我们的存在是一个脆弱的东西，我希望通过了解这些最危险的力量，我们可以更好地保护最重要的东西。",
	"{@b Lurker.} Master ambushers and assassins, lurkers strike first and hard. Using evasion and stealth to achieve their goals, lurkers are slippery foes that are difficult to lock down and destroy. Because adventurers travel in groups, most lurkers require the assistance of other creatures to finish the job. A lurker seeks to systematically and swiftly eliminate threats, taking heroes out of commission before they have a chance to respond.": "{@b Lurker.}伏击者和刺客高手，潜伏者先下手为强。潜伏者利用躲避和隐身来实现他们的目标，他们是难以锁定和消灭的狡猾敌人。由于冒险者是成群结队的，大多数潜伏者需要其他生物的协助才能完成任务。潜伏者试图系统地、迅速地消除威胁，在英雄们有机会作出反应之前就使他们失去行动能力。",
	"{@b Skirmisher.} Mobility specialists, skirmishers use hit-and-run tactics to deliver precise blows while avoiding reprisal. A skirmisher can swiftly capitalize on a vulnerable enemy or disrupt a tactical advantage. Clever skirmishers are good at teamwork, waiting for the precise moment to strike or baiting frustrated adventurers into chasing them into traps. A skirmisher wants to frustrate and harass its target, too dangerous to ignore but too elusive to easily kill.": "{@b Skirmisher.}机动性专家，小兵使用打了就跑的战术，在避免报复的同时给予精确的打击。小兵可以迅速地利用脆弱的敌人或破坏战术优势。聪明的小兵善于团队合作，等待准确的时机进行打击，或者诱使沮丧的冒险者追赶他们进入陷阱。一个小兵想要挫败和骚扰它的目标，太危险而无法忽视，但又太难以捉摸而无法轻易杀死。",
	"{@b Soldier.} Tactical melee combatants of the highest caliber, a creature with the soldier classification is an implacable barrier that cannot be overcome with brute force. These creatures often plant themselves firmly between any force seeking to assail weaker allies, punishing those who injure their comrades with a frightful vengeance. A soldier never fights alone and wants to enable and protect its more vulnerable allies to achieve victory.": "{@b Soldier.}最高水平的战术性近战战斗人员，士兵分类的生物是一个不可逾越的障碍，不能用蛮力克服。这些生物经常在任何试图攻击弱小盟友的力量之间牢牢地安插自己，以可怕的复仇之心惩罚那些伤害其同伴的人。士兵从不孤军奋战，希望能使其更脆弱的盟友获得胜利，并保护他们。",
	"An understanding of a creature's strengths and weaknesses is essential to a succesful encounter. Along with a monster's classification will be a short list of character abilities and features that favor or foil the monster's own abilities and features. Use this information to ensure your encounters challenge the players in the right ways, giving them a specific path to victory. Some mosnters favor no features, meaning there are no optimal paths to succeed against it.": "对生物的长处和弱点的理解对于成功的遭遇战是至关重要的。伴随着怪物的分类，会有一个简短的角色能力和特征清单，这些能力和特征有利于或挫败怪物自身的能力和特征。利用这些信息来确保你的遭遇战以正确的方式挑战玩家，给他们提供一条通往胜利的具体道路。有些怪物不喜欢任何特征，这意味着没有最佳的路径可以成功地对付它。",

	"{@b Foils.} Which character features, classes and abilities perform poorly against the monster.": "{@b Foils.} 哪些角色特征、等级和能力在面对怪物时表现不佳。",
	"The {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} features a number of creatures with a unique set of traits, summarized by classifying it as a titanic creature. A titanic creature is truly massive - with a unique anatomy that doesn't make sense for it to be treated as a single target. It has multiple sections, each of which functions like an independent creature, relying on the monster's core statistics for most of its effects. Each section has the same AC, resistances, immunities, and saving throw bonuses as the base statistical block of the creature. Sections are affected by conditions and other effects individually, unless explicity stated otherwise in the section's traits. A titanic creature's statistics describe how much space the creature takes up along with each of its sections, as well as its height. If you're using physical miniatures, you're unlikely to have a massive miniature that's appropriate, so you have may to improvise something. Because a titanic creature is so big, creatures smaller than it can always occupy the same space, or move through the titanic creature's space without penalty, and titanic creatures neither take nor provoke opportunity attacks.": "{@i Total Party Kill Bestiary}的特点是一些具有独特特征的生物，总结起来就是将其归类为泰坦生物。泰坦尼克号生物是真正巨大的--具有独特的解剖结构，将其作为单一目标处理是没有意义的。它有多个部分，每个部分的功能都像一个独立的生物，依靠怪物的核心统计数据来实现其大部分效果。每个部分都有与该生物的基本统计块相同的攻击力、抵抗力、免疫力和蓄力奖励。各个部分都受到条件和其他效果的影响，除非在部分特征中另有明确说明。一个泰坦尼克号生物的统计资料描述了该生物在其每个部分所占的空间，以及它的高度。如果你使用的是实物缩影，你不可能有一个合适的巨型缩影，所以你可能要即兴创作一些东西。由于泰坦尼克号生物是如此之大，比它小的生物总是可以占据相同的空间，或者在泰坦尼克号生物的空间内移动而不受到惩罚，而且泰坦尼克号生物既不采取也不挑起机会攻击。",
	"Every titanic creature has a core section. If the \"core\" section is reduced to zero hit points, the titanic creature is slain. Other sections that are reduced to zero hit points become {@condition incapacitated} for as long as it has zero hit points, but the creature as a whole remains alive and well. Some creatures can restore {@condition incapacitated} sections during a fight while other's cant. In general, unless a titanic creature has an ability that allows it to restore an {@condition incapacitated} section, it can only do so if it finishes a long rest, which allows each section to individually spend Hit Dice to recover hit points.": "每个泰坦尼克号生物都有一个核心部分。如果 \"核心 \"部分的命中率降至零，泰坦尼克号生物就会被杀死。只要它的命中率为零，其他部分就会变成{@condition incapacitated}，但生物作为一个整体仍然活着，而且很好。有些生物可以在战斗中恢复（%1%）的部分，而其他生物则不能。一般来说，除非泰坦生物有能力让它恢复{@condition incapacitated}的部分，否则它只能在完成长时间的休息后才能这样做，这样可以让每个部分单独花费命中率来恢复命中率。",
	"In combat, every section has a fixed initiative result that it acts on. On each section's turn, if that section has a speed, the entire creature can move during that section's turn, following normal rules for movement. In some cases, a creature may have a certain speed on a specific section's turn, such as a dragon with a \"wings\" section only having a fly speed when its \"wings\" act.": "在战斗中，每个部分都有一个固定的主动权结果，它根据这个结果行动。在每个部分的回合中，如果该部分有一个速度，整个生物在该部分的回合中可以按照正常的移动规则进行移动。在某些情况下，一个生物可能在某个特定部分的回合中拥有一定的速度，例如一条拥有 \"翅膀 \"部分的龙只有在其 \"翅膀 \"行动时才有飞行速度。",
	"Characters can attempt to climb a Titanic creature as part of their movement by making an {@skill Athletics} or {@skill Acrobatics} check (their choice) opposed by the creature's {@skill Athletics} or {@skill Acrobatics} check (DM's choice). Success means they can move up to half their speed along the creature, failure means they stay where they are, whether that's on the ground or upon the creature. Making this attempt doesn't require an action, but a creature can only attempt it once per turn. If a creature takes damage while climbing a titanic creature or a forced movement effect would push or pull them while climbing, they must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (their choice) against a DC of half the damage taken or 10, whichever is higher. Success means they hold on, remaining where they are. Failure means they fall, dropping to the ground in the titanic creature's space and taking falling damage as appropriate. Titanic creatures have disadvantage on all attacks against creatures that are currently climbing them.": "角色可以尝试爬上泰坦尼克号生物作为他们运动的一部分，方法是做一个{@skill Athletics}或{@skill Acrobatics}的检查（他们自己选择），与该生物的{@skill Athletics}或{@skill Acrobatics}检查相对立（DM选择）。成功意味着他们可以沿着该生物移动到他们速度的一半，失败意味着他们留在原地，无论是在地上还是在该生物身上。做这个尝试不需要行动，但一个生物每回合只能尝试一次。如果一个生物在攀爬泰坦尼克号时受到伤害，或者强制移动效果会在攀爬时推拉他们，他们必须做一个力量或灵巧的拯救动作（他们自己选择），其DC为所受伤害的一半或10，以高者为准。成功意味着他们坚持住了，留在原地。失败意味着他们坠落，在泰坦尼克号生物的空间里掉到地上，并受到相应的坠落伤害。泰坦尼克号生物在对目前正在攀爬它们的生物的所有攻击中都处于劣势。",
	"You should use your best judgement when it comes to targeting a creature's sections. Ranged attacks should be able to target any section if the caster is within range of the creature, but melee attacks and touch spells can only target sections the character should conceivably reach. A fighter with a sword, for example, isn't going to be able to attack the head of a 60-foot tall golem, he'll be stuck hacking at the legs.": "当涉及到瞄准一个生物的部分时，你应该使用你最好的判断力。如果施法者在生物的范围内，远程攻击应该能够瞄准任何部分，但近战攻击和触摸法术只能瞄准角色可以想象得到的部分。例如，一个拿着剑的战士不可能攻击一个60英尺高的石像的头部，他只能砍腿。",
	"Likewise, use your best judgment when it comes to applying a status effects to the titanic creature. Casting {@spell dominate monster} on a dragon's tail, for example, probably won't work. It would need to target the creature's head or its core to be effective. Likewise, you probably can't knock a golem's arm {@condition prone}. Otherwise, most effects will only affect one section of the creature. For example, you could stun a creature's arms or legs, preventing them from acting, but the rest of the creature would act as normal. Finally, most titanic creatures are immune to forced movement and teleportation effects unless they wish to be affected.": "同样地，在对泰坦尼克号生物施加状态效果时，请使用你最好的判断。例如，对龙的尾巴施放（%0%），可能不会起作用。它需要以生物的头部或核心为目标才有效。同样地，你可能也不能敲打巨魔的手臂（1%）。否则，大多数效果只能影响生物的一个部分。例如，你可以击晕一个生物的胳膊或腿，使其无法行动，但生物的其他部分会正常行动。最后，大多数泰坦尼克号生物对强制移动和传送效果是免疫的，除非它们希望被影响。",
	"To avoid making dozens of rules to cover every possibility, control of the details is in your hands. Go with what feels right from the descriptions provided above and your own sense of fair play.": "为了避免制定几十条规则来涵盖各种可能性，细节的控制权在你手中。根据上面提供的描述和你自己的公平竞争意识，选择感觉正确的方法。",
	"With a book full of deadly, high-level monsters, it is difficult to imagine there are even more lethal threats. Unfortunately for would-be heroes, a majority of monster groups within this tome have a single member that is marked with a special skull emblem, declaring it a lethal threat. These monsters are certified party-killers, guaranteed to deliver the toughest fight possible for their challenge rating. Each branded creature possesses abilities that when applied by a skilled DM make for an extraordinarily dangerous encounter. Such creatures should never be used lightly and only if you are absolutely certain your players can handle being wiped out. These creatuers do not fight fair. Their abilities are devastating and overwhelming when used correctly, not only to adventurers but to the world around them. Consider carefully the consequences to both your narrative and gameplay when implementing such a foe.": "在一本充满致命的高级怪物的书中，很难想象还有更多的致命威胁。不幸的是，这本书中的大多数怪物群体都有一个特殊的骷髅头标志，宣布其为致命的威胁。这些怪物都是经过认证的派对杀手，保证能在其挑战等级中提供最艰难的战斗。每种烙印生物都拥有一些能力，当熟练的DM应用这些能力时，就会产生异常危险的遭遇。这种生物绝对不能随便使用，而且只有在你绝对确定你的玩家可以承受被消灭的情况下才可以使用。这些生物不会公平战斗。如果使用得当，它们的能力是毁灭性的，不仅对冒险者，而且对它们周围的世界都是压倒性的。在实施这样的敌人时，要仔细考虑对你的叙述和游戏的后果。",
	"Many of the creatures presented in this book have a statement by the gnome bard Talien Vos Karven, sharing his personal experiences with the monster, along with the occasional insight from his adventuring companions.

	"While every monster in this book is presented with the usual array of information about its background and features, information that a DM can make available to players is also included. When your players want to research a foe before facing it in battle, you can allow them to attempt certain group ability checks to gain valuable lore that will improve their odds of success against it. Groups wishing to attempt such checks should make significant efforts to even attempt the roll—gathering evidence, tracking movements, consulting wise beings, or delving through forgotten tomes. Once the party has done so, they may attempt a group ability check as detailed in the monster's lore section. Depending on the result, the party gains valuable information about the monster's behavior and abilities, examples of which are found in each monster's lore table. You should alter this section and the lore therein at your discretion to better fit your game world. Unless the characters are extremely powerful, give them a chance to gain lore about creatures found in this book. It can make for a meaningful downtime activity between adventurers, and odds are it won't spoil the encounter. If they choose to pass on the opportunity, the players have no one to blame but themselves when your monster lays them out.": "虽然本书中的每个怪物都有关于其背景和特征的常规信息，但也包括了DM可以提供给玩家的信息。当你的玩家想在战斗前研究一个敌人时，你可以让他们尝试某些团体能力检查，以获得有价值的传说，从而提高他们对抗敌人的成功率。希望尝试这种检查的团体应该做出重大努力，甚至尝试滚动--收集证据、追踪行动、咨询智者，或者钻研被遗忘的书本。一旦队伍完成了这些工作，他们就可以尝试进行团体能力检查，详情见怪物的传说部分。根据结果，党派会获得关于怪物的行为和能力的有价值的信息，这些例子可以在每个怪物的传说表中找到。你应该酌情改变这一部分和其中的传说，以更好地适应你的游戏世界。除非角色非常强大，否则要让他们有机会获得关于本书中的生物的传说。这可以使冒险者之间的休息时间变得有意义，而且有可能不会破坏遭遇战。如果他们选择放弃这个机会，那么当你的怪物把他们干掉的时候，玩家就只能怪自己了。",
	"Monsters with a high challenge rating are far more complicated than their low-class comrades. This makes the DM's job harder, so it is essential to combat the ever-expanding powers characters attain at high levels. To mitigate the challenges of running encounters featuring complex creatures, each monster has a tactics section with recommended average, easier, and harder tactics. Use these suggestions to cut down on preparation time and as a reference when you aren't sure what your monster should do. No matter what your players' skill level, this section will help you craft a finely tuned encounter of any desired difficulty.": "具有高挑战等级的怪物要比它们的低级同伴复杂得多。这使得DM的工作更加困难，所以必须对抗角色在高等级时获得的不断扩大的力量。为了减轻以复杂生物为特征的遭遇战的挑战，每种怪物都有一个战术部分，其中包括推荐的平均、较容易和较难的战术。使用这些建议可以减少准备时间，并在你不确定你的怪物应该做什么时作为参考。无论玩家的技能水平如何，这一部分都能帮助你制作出任何所需难度的精巧的遭遇战。",
	"When you find a monster you'd like to include in your game, this section provides you with fantasy scenarios to make it a part of your game world. These hooks can be small story elements to put your creature on the map or important plot threads that tempt players into going on a monster hunt that spans a dozen sessions.": "当你发现一个你想在游戏中加入的怪物时，本节为你提供了幻想方案，使它成为你游戏世界的一部分。这些钩子可以是小的故事元素，让你的生物出现在地图上，也可以是重要的情节线索，引诱玩家去进行跨越十几个时段的怪物狩猎。",
	"A hard-won victory deserves a suitable reward, and many of the creatures in the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} possess valuable equipment or are made of rare components that can be forged into useful items. When a monster has a treasure section, it is still at your discretion what the characters receive as a reward after defeating the monster. However, it is recommended you grant these rewards for particularly demanding encounters. On top of making victory taste all the sweeter, such treasures serve as trophies to remind players about their past conflicts and make for a good story to tell at the local tavern.": "来之不易的胜利应该得到适当的奖励，{@i Total Party Kill Bestiary}中的许多生物都拥有宝贵的装备，或者由稀有的成分制成，可以锻造成有用的物品。当一个怪物有一个宝藏部分时，仍然由你决定角色在击败怪物后获得什么奖励。然而，建议你对特别苛刻的遭遇给予这些奖励。除了让胜利的滋味更加甜美之外，这些宝物还可以作为战利品，提醒玩家他们过去的冲突，并在当地的酒馆里讲一个好故事。",
	"Even the most fiendish of monsters have a home, and their ecology section details where they prefer to live, explore, and hunt. Use a creature's ecology when considering its role in your game world. While you can certainly plop any monster into a dungeon without context, creatures of power have a difficult time existing without making some impact on the world around them. By letting your creatures have something to do in their free time, you can foreshadow an encounter or motivate players to act against it.": "即使是最凶残的怪物也有一个家，它们的生态部分详细说明了它们喜欢在哪里生活、探索和狩猎。在考虑一个生物在你的游戏世界中的作用时，要使用它的生态环境。虽然你可以在没有背景的情况下把任何怪物塞进地牢，但有能力的生物如果不对它们周围的世界产生一些影响，就很难存在。通过让你的生物在它们的空闲时间做些什么，你可以预示一个遭遇，或者激励玩家对它采取行动。",
	"Whether they be obnoxious or do-gooders spreading virtue about your grimdark game world or self-serving murderers smashing your intricate narratives to pieces, eventually characters need a good old fashion beat down. To suffer defeat is a meaningful RPG experience, and to snatch victory from the jaws of failure is always a campaign highlight. While the \"TPK\" in the book's title need not be taken literally, every game needs a few moments when the players wonder, {@i Is this the end?}": "无论他们是令人厌恶的好人，还是在你灰暗的游戏世界中传播美德的人，或者是自以为是的杀人犯，将你错综复杂的叙事打成碎片，最终角色都需要一个好的老式的打倒。遭受失败是一种有意义的RPG体验，而从失败中抢夺胜利总是一个活动的亮点。虽然书名中的 \"TPK \"不需要从字面上理解，但每个游戏都需要有几个时刻让玩家想知道，{@i Is this the end?}",
	"To make best use of this book and its monsters, you will need the 5th Edition core rules on hand to construct encounters. Your skills as a DM will come into play while implementing this content into your world. While it's tempting to completely wreck your players with an impossibly powerful creature, the goal of the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} is to put the most powerful characters in 5th Edition through fights that challenge and excite them. You should familiarize yourself with the general rules of encounter building, particularly those concerning combat encounter difficulty.": "为了更好地利用本书及其中的怪物，你需要手头的第五版核心规则来构建遭遇战。在将这些内容落实到你的世界中时，你作为DM的技能将发挥作用。虽然用一种不可能的强大生物完全摧毁你的玩家是很诱人的，但（%0%）的目标是让第五版中最强大的角色经历挑战和兴奋的战斗。你应该熟悉建立奇遇的一般规则，特别是那些关于战斗奇遇的难度。",
	"Because these montsers are organized into groups, where there is one, there are often more. Running a monster from this book can be the characters' first introduction to what becomes an entire family of lethal beasts, making them ideal for recurring enemies that continually raise the difficulty bar. Most of the time, characters can observe and interact with monster groups without fighting. These monsters can be more than deadly threats that lurk in a dungeon. They can tell a story, facilitate world building, and provide character niches that intrigue and disgust your players.": "因为这些怪物被组织成群，有一个，往往就有更多。从这本书中运行一个怪物可能是人物对成为整个致命野兽家族的第一次介绍，使他们成为不断提高难度的反复出现的敌人的理想选择。大多数时候，人物可以观察并与怪物群互动，而不需要战斗。这些怪物可能不仅仅是潜伏在地牢中的致命威胁。它们可以讲述一个故事，促进世界的建设，并提供角色的壁龛，使你的玩家感到好奇和厌恶。",
	"Every monster in 5th Edition has a challenge rating that indicates what its difficulty should be relative to characters of a certain level, and the ones found here are no different. Using challenge rating appropriately with these creatures can result in easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters according to the general rules of encounter building. This section talks about using the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} and the 5th Edition rules for determining challenge rating to create a quality high-level experience you can find nowhere else.": "第五版中的每一种怪物都有一个挑战等级，表明相对于某一等级的角色而言，其难度应该是多少，这里的怪物也不例外。根据建立奇遇的一般规则，对这些生物适当地使用挑战等级可以产生简单、中等、困难和致命的奇遇。本节讲述了如何使用（%0%）和第五版确定挑战等级的规则来创造你在其他地方找不到的优质高级体验。",
	"With high-level play in 5th Edition comes big numbers. As a creature's chance to hit, save DCs, AC, and other features improve, so too do its odds of success in its endeavors or chance of foiling its attackers. Where the d20 eas once the biggest factor in determining success at lower levels, at high levels a creatures' (or character's) significant bonuses to their advantages weigh more heavily. A creature with a +20 to hit is probably going to land most of its attacks regardless of its d20 rolls, and its damage rolls are going to be more consistent with a +10 bonus from its Strength. With the exception of the natural 1 and natural 20, this means you can expect a more average result from creatures in your encounters with fewer twists from wacky rolls. Beware! This consistency also applies to your encounter's weaknesses. Having no bonuses to an Intelligence saving throw means your creature has almost no chance of beating a DC 19 saving throw versus a {@spell feeblemind} spell. While this truth requires more forethought when building your encounters, it also makes predicting encounter outcomes and dynamics a lot easier. Use this to your advantage to deliver on more precise results and encounter goals!": "在第五版中，高水平的游戏伴随着大量的数字。随着一个生物的命中率、救赎DCs、AC和其他特征的提高，它的成功几率和挫败攻击者的机会也随之提高。在低级别的情况下，D20曾经是决定成功与否的最大因素，而在高级别的情况下，生物（或角色）对其优势的重大奖励就显得更为重要了。一个拥有+20命中率的生物可能会使它的大部分攻击落地，而不考虑它的d20卷，它的伤害卷会与它的力量的+10奖励更加一致。除了自然的1和自然的20之外，这意味着你可以期望在你的遭遇中从生物那里得到一个更平均的结果，而从古怪的滚动中得到更少的扭曲。请注意! 这种一致性也适用于你的遭遇战的弱点。对智力救赎没有奖励意味着你的生物几乎没有机会战胜DC19对{@spell feeblemind}法术的救赎。虽然这个事实要求你在构建奇遇时要有更多的预想，但它也使得预测奇遇的结果和动态变得更加容易。利用这一点来实现你的优势，以达到更精确的结果和遭遇战的目标。",
	"To a group of adventurers, death at 1st level is a catastrophe, at 6th level a significant inconvenience, at 10th level a pit stop, and at 15th level a speedbump. When you are dealing with characters who can exile their foes to other planes, {@spell wish} reality into new forms, or enslave a small army of minions, providing a challenge means thinking about the game differently. While your encounter might technically be \"deadly,\" killing a 16th-level fighter doesn't mean much when his cleric friend burns a single 3rd-level spell slot to cast {@spell revivify}. When thinking abount encounter difficulty for characters of 10th level or higher, we recommend changing the goals of encounters to reflect the following instead of their traditional explanations. When using monsters from the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} with encounter-building tools, these are the intended difficulty results. When using monsters from other resources, you probably have to assume the challenge ratings provided are actually lower than what they need to be to achieve these kinds of encounter results.": "对于一群冒险家来说，1级的死亡是一场灾难，6级的死亡是一个重大的不便，10级的死亡是一个坑，15级的死亡是一个减速带。当你面对的角色可以将他们的敌人流放到其他位面，{@spell wish}现实变成新的形式，或者奴役一小群小兵的时候，提供挑战意味着对游戏的思考方式不同。虽然你的遭遇在技术上可能是 \"致命的\"，但当一个16级的战士的牧师朋友用一个3级的法术槽来施放（%1%）时，杀死他并不意味着什么。在考虑10级以上角色的遭遇战难度时，我们建议改变遭遇战的目标，以反映以下情况，而不是其传统解释。当使用来自{@i Total Party Kill Bestiary}与奇遇构建工具的怪物时，这些是预期的难度结果。当使用来自其他资源的怪物时，你可能不得不假设所提供的挑战等级实际上低于实现这类遭遇战结果所需的等级。",
	"An easy encounter requires almost no effort to overcome. High-level characters will blaze through these encounters quickly and efficiently (sometimes with a single spell cast), making them better suited for storytelling tools than actual challenges. High level heroes have better things to do than battle weak foes that do not test their abilities. A party can handle an a near unlimited number of these encounters in an adventuring day.": "一个简单的遭遇几乎不需要付出任何努力就能克服。高级别的角色会快速有效地通过这些遭遇（有时只需施放一个法术），使它们更适合作为讲故事的工具而不是实际的挑战。高级别的英雄有更好的事情要做，而不是与不考验他们能力的弱小敌人作战。在一个冒险日中，一个团队可以处理几乎无限数量的这种遭遇。",
	"A medium encounter should be dangerous to any party that does not take it seriously. Player arrogance, laziness, or ignorance should cost the party significant resources, while a well-prepared and focused group should not be in mortal danger unless they get supremely unlucky. A party can handle between four to five of these encounters in a single adventuring day.": "对于任何不认真对待的队伍来说，中等规模的遭遇战应该是危险的。玩家的傲慢、懒惰或无知应该使队伍失去大量的资源，而一个准备充分、注意力集中的队伍应该不会有致命的危险，除非他们运气极差。一个团队在一个冒险日里可以处理四到五个这样的遭遇。",
	"A hard encounter is a brutal experience. If a party goes in unprepared, they will suffer dire consequences: deaths, massive resource expenditures, and negative impacts to the story. Even a party fully prepared for the trials ahead will be tested, having to apply every ounce of their skill and creativity to succeed. A party can handle between two to three of these encounters in a single adventuring day.": "艰难的遭遇是一种残酷的经历。如果一支队伍在毫无准备的情况下进入，他们将遭受可怕的后果：死亡、大量的资源消耗和对故事的负面影响。即使是对前面的考验有充分准备的队伍也会受到考验，必须运用他们的每一盎司的技能和创造力才能成功。在一个冒险日中，一个团队可以处理两到三个这样的遭遇。",
	"A deadly encounter is an extraordinary event that can smash even the most powerful heroes into pieces. Every time you run one of these encounters, an unprepared party should be guaranteed defeat in one fashion or another. Nothing the party does should be enough to assure victory, only provide them a fighting chance. Your players should feel like the encounter threatens to end their adventuring career and should require an extraordinary amount of skill (and luck) to emerge unscathed. Most deadly encounters aren't lethal enough to actually end the campaign but should have significant consequences for failure. However, if you have the iron will required to let your game end based on the encounter's outcome, using an appropriate creature bearing the TPK brand can make that a reality. A party can handle one of these encounters in a single adventuring day, commonly requiring a long rest immediately afterward.": "致命的遭遇是一个非同寻常的事件，甚至可以将最强大的英雄打成碎片。每次遇到这种情况时，没有准备的队伍都会以这样或那样的方式失败。队伍所做的一切都不足以保证胜利，只能为他们提供一个战斗机会。你的玩家应该感觉到这种遭遇会威胁到他们的冒险生涯，应该需要大量的技巧（和运气）才能毫发无损。大多数致命的遭遇并不致命，不足以真正结束活动，但应该对失败有重大影响。然而，如果你有足够的意志力让你的游戏根据遭遇战的结果而结束，那么使用带有TPK标志的适当的生物可以使之成为现实。一个团队可以在一个冒险日内处理一个这样的遭遇战，通常需要在之后立即进行长时间的休息。",

A horrific blending of two or more animals, abominable hybrids bring the most fearsome offensive abilities of thei respective components to bear. Each time a hybrid appears, it is but one of dozens of potential combinations. As a DM, you will have to construct a hybrid to fit the needs of your game using a convenient \"build a beast\" system. This system starts with the hybrid base stat block, and then you add two or more {@filter animal essences|optionalfeatures|Feature Type=AE} to it, modifying its abilities and other statistics. Benefits in each essence that are marked with \"(Trait)\" should be included in the final creature's stat block for reference.

Hybrids are melee bruisers with a lot of hit points and comparatively low AC. They can use their Brawn over Brains trait to make Constitution saving throws in place of Intelligence or Charisma, making them strong against effects that force those saving throws.

	"Adding the {@optfeature essence of spider|TPK} gives a lot of new traits and changes to the hybrid's stats that make it an adept ambusher on land, particularly caverns and dungeons where it can benefit from its Spider Climb trait. Including some webs in the area helps the hybrid leverage its Web Sense and Web Walker traits for extra advantage. In combat, a hybrid with {@optfeature essence of spider|TPK} can use its Web ability to restrain a creature from a distance, locking down ranged attackers or spellcasters while it engages the rest of the party.

	"The {@optfeature essence of python|TPK} provides a climb speed and {@sense blindsight}, allowing the hybrid to function in heavily obscured areas like dense fog or magical darkness. The Constrict action is a dangerous grapple attack best paired with another like the shark's Bite or the spider's Sting. The Swallow Whole attack can take a character out of the fight temporarily and is great when used against some rogues and spellcasters who may struggle to do enough damage to free themselves.": "{@optfeature essence of python|TPK}提供了一个攀爬速度和{@sense blindsight}，使混血儿能够在浓雾或魔法黑暗等严重遮蔽的地方发挥作用。束缚动作是一种危险的抓取攻击，最好与鲨鱼的咬伤或蜘蛛的刺伤等其他攻击搭配使用。囫囵吞枣的攻击可以使一个角色暂时脱离战斗，当用来对付一些流氓和施法者时是很好的，他们可能很难造成足够的伤害来释放自己。",

	"{@b Harder Tactics} - Ambushes are a great way to start a fight, and with both the {@optfeature essence of spider|TPk} and octopus providing advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks, it's easy to make a hybrid with a talent for concealing itself. Most essence options also add a way for the hybrid to grapple a creature, and since the hybrids are Huge in size, they can move a Medium creature they are grappling without being slowed down. Combine that with swim, fly, or climb speeds and a hybrid can easily split the party by pulling one character into a hard-to-reach spot before tearing into them.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 埋伏是开始战斗的好方法，由于{@optfeature essence of spider|TPk}和章鱼都能提供灵巧({@skill Stealth})检查的优势，所以很容易制造出一个具有隐藏自己天赋的混合体。大多数精华选项也为混血儿增加了一种抓捕生物的方法，由于混血儿的体型巨大，他们可以移动被他们抓捕的中等生物而不被拖累。结合游泳、飞行或攀爬的速度，混血儿可以很容易地将一个角色拉到一个难以到达的地方，然后再撕咬他们，从而分裂整个队伍。",

Whether created with intention or by some catastrophic accident, these artificial beings exhibit a wide range of magical properties in association with a school of magic.

Few ever see the blades of the champion of death as it cleaves their souls into the afterlife, a peaceful death soon to be shared with every living thing the champion can find.": "死亡是所有生命的命运，而死亡的冠军则是命运的工具。这些亡灵是灵魂的牧羊人，他们迎来了最后的帷幕，宣告生命之火熄灭的时刻已经到来。它是一个几乎不可阻挡的杀手，挥舞着双镰刀，同样轻松地劈开盔甲、肉体和精神。死亡战士的外形是一个披着阴暗长袍的骷髅半人马，它的任何动作都不会产生任何声音，与坟墓的宁静相呼应。他们的打击不造成任何痛苦，每一次击打都会将生命力从他们的目标身上切断。很少有人看到死亡使者的刀锋，因为它将他们的灵魂劈入来世，一个平静的死亡很快就会被使者找到的每一个活物分享。",
	"The mere memory of this one sends shivers down my spine, like I'll never be warm again. A champion of death looks right into your soul and knows a hundred ways to rend it from your body. Possessed of incredible speed, it can strike so quickly it will separate your head from your shoulders before you realize it moved. A warding shell of antilife energies prevents living beings from getting close, and the champion wields its long-handled scythes with impunity. Elkus Dalgren is the only cleric I know who can stand up to undead of this magnitude, and even he was hesitant. Granted, his hesitation was because he had to find time between fending off a demonic incursion and founding another alcoholism support group, but all the same, one should not take these avatars of death lightly if one enjoys being alive.": "仅仅是对这个人的记忆就使我不寒而栗，就像我再也不会感到温暖。一个死亡斗士直视着你的灵魂，知道有一百种方法可以将它从你的身体中剥离。它拥有难以置信的速度，可以快速出击，在你意识到它的动作之前就把你的头和你的肩膀分开。一个由反生命能量组成的防护壳阻止了生物的接近，而冠军则肆无忌惮地挥舞着它的长柄镰刀。埃尔库斯-达尔格伦是我所知道的唯一能对抗这种程度的亡灵的牧师，甚至他也犹豫不决。当然，他的犹豫是因为他必须在抵御恶魔入侵和创立另一个酗酒支持团体之间寻找时间，但同样，如果一个人喜欢活着，就不应该轻视这些死亡的化身。",

	"In the deepest forests, darkest swamps, and most primeval jungles, serpents with potent toxins thrive. Centuries of breeding in isolation have pushed one such family of venomous snakes to the absolute pinnacle of lethality. Called assassin vipers, these abominations of evolution slither through the underbrush, lurking until worthy prey comes within reach. The greatest of killers wish they could possess the killing potential of a single assassin viper bite; whose venom is so potent even mighty dragons can succumb within minutes.

	"Snakes are often portrayed unfavorably in fantasy and mythology, appearing in many RPGs as a symbol of evil. While you can certainly use the assassin vipers represented here in this manner, consider the merits of treating them in a more positive or neutral light. Snakes are not inherently cruel, nor are they emotionless. They experience fear, pleasure, and anger like many other animals. With the aid of magic and a little imagination, there is no reason an assassin viper in your game cannot be a heroic animal companion, affectionate pet, or an element of nature deserving of consideration and respect. Fantasy cultures and peoples may not fall prey to the same biases and stigmas our society has against snakes. To a city of reptile lovers, keeping an assassin viper may be the equivalent of owning an exotic bird or rearing a purebred horse!": "蛇在幻想和神话中常常被描绘得很不利，在许多RPG游戏中作为邪恶的象征出现。虽然你当然可以以这种方式使用这里所代表的刺客毒蛇，但要考虑以更积极或中立的方式对待它们的好处。蛇并不是天生残忍的，也不是没有感情的。它们像许多其他动物一样经历恐惧、快乐和愤怒。借助于魔法和一点想象力，你的游戏中的刺客毒蛇没有理由不成为一个英雄的动物伙伴、有感情的宠物或值得考虑和尊重的自然元素。幻想中的文化和民族可能不会受到我们社会对蛇的偏见和污名的影响。对于一个爬行动物爱好者的城市来说，饲养一条刺客毒蛇可能相当于拥有一只异国情调的鸟或饲养一匹纯种的马",

One day, as the king lounged in his throne, a ranger approached. Old and wise, she offered to entertain the king with a display of her pets. Among them, a shimmering orange-yellow cobra. The king leaned forward, captivated by its resemblance to molten gold. The ranger offered the serpent to the king, and he took it gingerly. \"Be careful, he bites,\" were the last words the king heard before the snake's fangs plunged into his neck.

The largest of these {@creature mimic|MM|mimics} undergo a metamorphosis, permanently assuming the general shape of large objects and structures. These \"behemoth mimics\" are highly specialized hunters that are adapted to specific environments. Different strains of behemoth mimics specialize in specific shapes.

	"What extraordinary creatures! My heart has always had a fondness for the {@creature mimic|MM} and its brilliant adaptation. The \"mimic test\" has proven to be an exceptional measure of whether one is cut out for the adventuring lifestyle. Much like their lesser brethren, I suspect behemoth mimics are responsible for a great many dungeon delving careers getting cut short. I can hardly fault the {@creature mimic|MM|mimics} for this. After all, it is we adventurers who dive head first into the dark corners of the world in search of glory and treasure. One doesn't fault the tiger for hunting the antelope - it is in its nature.

	"Each behemoth mimic is like a miniature dungeon. Due to their huge size and nature as a creature, object, and structure, running these encounters is no small task. One of the most exciting aspects of the behemoth mimics is their customizable nature.

Beyond that, the layout and design of your behemoth mimic is something for you to create. You could make the interior of your mimic a dizzying maze, fill its section with loot, or even add minions that have made the mimic their home. A more detailed mimic makes the disguise more convincing to your players in the metagame, in addition to increasing the encounter's difficulty. Consider the merits of presenting your behemoth mimic in the form of a battle map to explore, rather than a creature to be fought (at least at first).

They rarely stay still for long, lingering just long enough to feed before moving on to more unsuspecting locales. The creatures seem drawn to areas of magical activity, and when given the choice always prefer spellcasters as a meal. When not on the hunt, living mage towers are surprisingly communicative. They will happily hold conversation with other creatures, so long as doing so does not reveal its true nature. They are shockingly ignorant about magic, especially when considering their abilities. To a living mage tower, its spellcasting is pure instinct, and a minor curiosity at best.

The magic at these creature's disposal is formidable. Each possesses enough firepower to level a small city, let alone a party of intrepid adventurers. They are also far more mobile than their lesser counterparts, teleporting vast distances in an instance in search of gullible prey. Everything about these creatures screams overkill to me.

	"Stone singers don't do well in open areas. The birds prefer territories of stone and earth which best complement their abilities. These environments become distinctly artificial, as the stone singer's obsessive artistic tendencies compel it to sculpt each stone into bizarre shapes. Combined with the petrified bodies of its victims, a stone singer's territory becomes a perverse museum of stone, disturbing travelers and local wildlife alike. Because a stone singer cannot compel humanoids to enter its territory, it will always choose a location well-traveled as its domain. This inevitably causes massive headaches for those affected, as only violence can compel a stone singer to leave, and even then, unless killed, the bird will eventually return.": "石头歌手在空旷的地方做得并不好。这些鸟儿更喜欢由石头和泥土组成的领地，这对它们的能力是最好的补充。这些环境成为明显的人工环境，因为石歌手的强迫性艺术倾向迫使它把每块石头都雕刻成奇怪的形状。再加上受害者的石化尸体，石歌手的领地变成了一个变态的石头博物馆，让旅行者和当地的野生动物都感到不安。由于石歌手不能强迫人类进入它的领地，它总是选择一个人迹罕至的地方作为它的领域。这不可避免地会给受影响的人带来巨大的麻烦，因为只有暴力才能迫使石歌手离开，即使如此，除非被杀死，否则石歌手最终会回来。",

So when a particularly twisted green began an elaborate breeding program between different types of chromatic dragons, everyone assumed the worst. They were not disappointed. After dozens of abominable failures, a new race of true-bred dragon was born: the truculent and savage brown dragon. Unattractive and malformed, brown dragons combine the worst mental and physical qualities of each chromatic dragon species. From that twisted combination is born a ravenous hunger that never ceases. This genetic anomaly drives all brown dragons towards acts of wanton and destruction, and they consume everything that barely qualifies as edible (and even a few things that don't). With this hunger comes a metabolism of epic proportions. Brown dragons can easily consume their weigh in food in a single day with room for more. The more a brown dragon eats, the larger it gets. Those that are able to feast with great regularity rapidly mature, circumventing a typical dragon's normally slow rate of growth. If the goal of the experimenting green was to create a universal menace that knows no allegiance, then it undoubtably succeeded, for brown dragons have been a horrific plague upon the world since the day they were first created.": "色素龙并不以其闪光的亲和力或礼仪而闻名。因此，当一个特别扭曲的绿色开始在不同类型的色龙之间进行精心的繁殖计划时，每个人都认为是最糟糕的。他们并没有感到失望。在经历了几十次可恶的失败后，一个新的真龙种族诞生了：凶残野蛮的棕龙。棕色的龙没有吸引力，而且畸形，它们结合了每个色系龙种最糟糕的精神和身体素质。从这种扭曲的组合中，诞生了一种永不停止的贪婪的饥饿感。这种基因异常驱使所有棕龙走向恣意和破坏的行为，它们吞噬一切勉强符合食用条件的东西（甚至还有一些不符合食用条件的东西）。这种饥饿感带来了史诗般的新陈代谢。棕龙可以很容易地在一天内消耗掉它们的食物重量，并有余力去吃更多。棕龙吃得越多，它就越大。那些能够经常大吃大喝的褐龙迅速成熟，避开了一般龙的缓慢生长速度。如果绿色实验的目标是创造一个不知道效忠对象的普遍威胁，那么它无疑是成功的，因为自从褐龙被创造出来的那天起，它们就一直是世界上的一个可怕的祸害。",

While other chromatic dragons are cruel and evil by their nature, brown dragons are compelled to acts of violence by design. While they are motivated by food in the most extreme sense, I don't think it is possible to satisfy their hunger. At best one can delay or placate a menacing brown dragon with gifts of food, but it is a mistake to believe such a relationship can last.

When these creatures eat something their stomachs can't handle or pass, it stews in its tract and causes the dragon great discomfort. Eventually, the dragon will vomit forth a mass of congealed metal, stone, and other indigestible bits, fused together by stomach acid. While disgusting, this material is useful as a scent enhancer, highly prized for use in perfumes and other scented accessories. This \"dragon ambergris\" is worth more than 2,000 gp per pound.

	"Because most creatures don't appreciate being chewed, brown dragons learn from a young age to be confrontational and violent. Every living creature they encounter is either food or could become food—a most convenient arrangement in the dragon's eyes. However, older and more experienced dragons often learn the value of allies and associates. They will trade and barter with these creatures, exchanging their treasure and services for food. A well-fed and respected brown dragon is a dependable ally (as long as one holds one's nose). When establishing a lair, brown dragons prefer open hills into which they can burrow huge caverns, preferably with substantial prey nearby. These dragons must frequently relocate after exhausting the surrounding environment of all resources, reducing the land to a barren wasteland stripped of everything worth eating.": "由于大多数生物不喜欢被啃咬，棕龙从小就学会了对抗和暴力。它们遇到的每一个生物要么是食物，要么可能成为食物--在龙的眼中，这是最方便的安排。然而，年长和更有经验的龙往往学会了盟友和伙伴的价值。它们会与这些生物进行交易和交换，用它们的财宝和服务换取食物。一只吃饱喝足、受人尊敬的棕龙是一个可靠的盟友（只要牵制住自己的鼻子）。在建立巢穴时，棕龙更喜欢开阔的山丘，它们可以在其中钻出巨大的洞穴，最好是附近有大量的猎物。在耗尽周围环境的所有资源后，这些龙必须经常搬迁，使土地变成一片贫瘠的荒地，没有任何值得吃的东西。",

	"These lairs must be large to accommodate a brown dragon's girth and are protected by huge boulders that are rolled in front of passageways. Essential to a lair's composition is a source of fresh water, as brown dragons thirst as much as they hunger and prefer to move as little as possible after a big meal.

	"When a brown dragon is born, it immediately consumes its eggshell. It then eats any hatch-mates, local wildlife, and everything else that it can fit in its mouth around. Terrified and ravenous, brown dragon wyrmlings instinctively seek out food above all other concerns. This drive helps them escape the most vulnerable period of their lives, ideally advancing to their \"young\" age category within a year of successful feasting. Thankfully brown dragon wyrmlings can't actually eat that much due to their size, and more than a few creatures have enlisted the service of these dragons with a promise of food.

It will then drag the target away from the battle, attempting to flee with its prize. If the dragon isn't satisfied—which is quite likely—it can always come back later for seconds. When forced to fight to the death, the dragon unleashes its Flensing Breath for maximum effect, noting which creatures fail their saving throws against it. It then targets those creatures with single-minded savagery, attempting to down them before moving on to new targets.": "棕龙的机会主义性质从它的战斗策略中可以看出。除非它别无选择，否则它就会为确保一顿饭而战斗，仅此而已。即使只是一只小龙，它也不小。它可以抓住任何它能用下巴咬住的东西，更喜欢看起来最美味的目标。然后它将把目标拖离战斗，试图带着它的战利品逃走。如果龙不满意--这是很有可能的--它总能在稍后的时间里再回来找人。当被迫进行生死搏斗时，龙会释放它的Flensing Breath以达到最大效果，并注意到哪些生物对它的救赎失败。然后，它一心一意地瞄准这些生物，试图击倒它们，然后再转向新的目标。",

Unless raised in an unusual environment, a brown dragon's sinister nature becomes dominant. This makes these dragons heartless and self-centered, refusing to do anything unless it directly benefits their interests. Some even develop cruel habits, such as holding struggling prey in their mouths just to feel them squirm. While far from dull, young brown dragons act with a shortsighted stubbornness, unable to plan more than a step or two ahead or see the big picture of a given situation. Each young brown dragon starts to develop a unique palate, finding it more enjoyable to eat certain foods rather than whatever they come across. A dragon will go to some lengths to acquire its preferred food, which can be used as leverage by a shrewd negotiator.": "如果一只{@creature brown dragon wyrmling|TPK}能够在500天以上的时间里每天吃下其重量的食物，它将成长为一只年轻的棕龙。与其他真龙相比，这些少年标本更肥壮，它们已经发展出了新的生理能力和战斗策略，以适应其庞大的形态。除非在一个不寻常的环境中长大，否则棕龙的阴险本性会成为主导。这使得这些龙无情无义，以自我为中心，拒绝做任何事情，除非直接有利于它们的利益。有些甚至养成了残忍的习惯，比如把挣扎的猎物含在嘴里，只是为了感觉它们在蠕动。虽然远非沉闷，但年轻的棕龙的行为是短视的固执，不能提前一两步计划或看到一个特定情况的大画面。每条年轻的棕龙都开始发展出独特的味觉，发现吃某些食物比吃它们遇到的任何东西都更令人愉快。一条龙会不遗余力地获取它喜欢的食物，这可以作为精明的谈判者的筹码。",
	"The secret to defeating a brown dragon is its sense of taste. Find out what it likes and you will have the advantage. Don't let their motley appearance and dour demeanor fool you—these dragons fight as savagely as an angry white with the cunning of a conniving green. The heritage these dragons share with the pure chromatics appears to be a point of great offense among dragonkind, and I can understand why. When I mentioned their relationship to the great Pyrathraxis Hexfang, her thunderous objection blew out both my eardrums.": "打败棕龙的秘密是它的味觉。找出它喜欢的东西，你就会有优势。不要被它们杂乱的外表和沉闷的举止所迷惑--这些龙的战斗力就像愤怒的白龙和狡猾的绿龙一样野蛮。这些龙与纯色龙共享的遗产似乎在龙族中引起了极大的反感，我也能理解这一点。当我向伟大的Pyrathraxis Hexfang提到他们的关系时，她雷鸣般的反对声炸毁了我的两个耳膜。",
	"With a good number of fights under its belt and a new array of abilities, young brown dragons fight with far greater confidence than {@creature brown dragon wyrmling|TPK|wyrmlings}. Most will open with a Challenging Roar to keep tasty morsels from escaping or from aiding allies in dire situations. The dragon will then Bite an enemy as quickly as possible, choosing a frail and chewable target. Once its foes are good and injured, it will unleash its Flensing Breath for maximum effect, finishing off low-health targets who couldn't succeed on the saving throw. Notice that the dragon's Hyper Metabolism feature has improved, allowing it to consume bodies for additional hit points. Doing so typically requires a {@action Use an Object} action on the dragon's part but can be well worth the effort.": "有了良好的战斗经验和一系列新的能力，年轻的棕龙在战斗中的信心远比（%0%）强。大多数会以挑战式的吼叫开场，以防止美味的小动物逃跑或在危急情况下帮助盟友。然后龙会尽可能快地咬住一个敌人，选择一个虚弱的和可咀嚼的目标。一旦它的敌人受伤，它就会释放它的Flensing Breath以达到最大效果，结束那些无法成功挽救的低健康目标。请注意，龙的超级新陈代谢功能已得到改善，允许它消耗身体以获得额外的命中率。这样做通常需要龙的一个{@action Use an Object}行动，但这是非常值得的。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - Don't use the dragon's Challenging Roar, and proceed straight to the mauling. Play up the dragon's overconfident and brutal nature, like an oversized cat toying with pests. Only use Flensing Breath against a single character at a time and never against low-health targets who could get taken to 0 hit points.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 不要使用龙的挑战吼叫，直接进行打斗。发挥龙的过度自信和残忍的特性，就像一只超大的猫在玩弄害虫。每次只对一个角色使用弗林斯之息，不要对可能被打到0点的低健康目标使用。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - The dragon will fight in its lair, basing its strategies on the effects it produces. It won't focus on eating to recover hit points, knowing that dealing damage is far more effective toward ending a fight. Use Flensing Breath on the first turn and at every available opportunity thereafter. Its damage is substantial, and the effect is brutal.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 龙会在它的巢穴中战斗，以它产生的效果为基础制定策略。它不会专注于吃东西来恢复命中率，因为它知道造成伤害对于结束战斗要有效得多。在第一轮和之后的每一次机会中使用弗林斯之息。它的伤害是巨大的，而且效果是残酷的。",
	"An excitable brown dragon has learned what a chef is and has decided to acquire one to serve her personally. With no chefs lining up for the job, she has decided to kidnap one from a local town, along with a few tasty travel snacks.": "一条兴奋的棕龙已经知道了什么是厨师，并决定获得一名厨师为她个人服务。由于没有厨师排队等候，她决定从当地的一个小镇上绑架一名厨师，以及一些美味的旅行小吃。",
	"A girthy {@creature hill giant|MM} has challenged a local brown dragon to an eating contest. Whoever eats the most halflings in a single day wins, and the contest starts next week. The halfling community is horrified, while the scum and villainy of the world begin a betting pool with tremendous payout potential.": "一个半身人（%0%）向当地的棕龙挑战，要进行一场吃东西的比赛。谁在一天之内吃了最多的半身人，谁就赢了，比赛从下周开始。半身人社区被吓坏了，而世界上的人渣和小人则开始了一个具有巨大赔付潜力的赌注池。",
	"A young brown dragon crashes in the middle of a small town, writhing in pain from something stuck in its gut. So far, the dragon hasn't hurt anyone but has caused considerable property damage in its agony. A brave and skilled healer is required to cure the creature, which will hopefully continue on its journey.": "一条年轻的棕龙坠落在一个小镇的中央，因为有东西卡在它的肠子里而痛苦地蠕动着。到目前为止，这条龙还没有伤害任何人，但在它的痛苦中造成了相当大的财产损失。需要一个勇敢而熟练的治疗师来治愈这个生物，希望它能继续它的旅程。",
	"If a {@creature young brown dragon|TPK} is able to eat its weight in food each day for 2,000 days, it will grow to become an adult brown dragon. At this point the dragon's appetite has reached legendary levels, and there are few creatures it has not tasted. Its culinary expertise is exceptional, and the dragon is able to divine a tremendous amount of information just by tasting something once. Its obsession with a certain type of food has narrowed to be even more specific. A brand of liquor, certain breed of animal, or specific subrace of humanoid are typically within the range of specificity appropriate for this obsession. While its hunger is no less great, the dragon has learned to live with the discomfort, preferring a quality meal over mindless consumption. An adult brown dragon delights in sharing knowledge of food and drink with others, a disturbing experience to many who would never dream of eating half the things a brown dragon would.": "如果一只{@creature young brown dragon|TPK}能够在2000天内每天吃下其重量的食物，它将成长为一只成年的棕龙。这时，龙的胃口已经达到了传说中的水平，很少有生物是它没有尝过的。它的烹饪技能非常出色，只需品尝一次东西，龙就能得出大量的信息。它对某类食物的痴迷已经缩小到更加具体。酒的品牌、动物的特定品种或人形的特定亚种通常都在适合这种痴迷的具体范围内。虽然它的饥饿感并不弱，但龙已经学会了忍受不适，更喜欢高质量的食物而不是无意识的消费。成年棕龙乐于与他人分享食物和饮料的知识，这对许多人来说是一种令人不安的经历，他们做梦也不会想到会吃棕龙的一半东西。",
	"I met an adult brown dragon once, and I am pleased to report they do grow more tolerable with age. You shouldn't trust one, of course, but they are not entirely governed by hunger like younger specimens. The one I encountered had an obsession with apples and become ecstatic when I provided three wagons full. The creature was then content to answer many of my questions and even share some of its own knowledge about the taste and texture of many creatures—knowledge I admit I did not have. Though I don't think I'll ever get over its description about how a gnome like myself tastes.": "我曾经遇到过一只成年棕龙，我很高兴地告诉大家，它们确实随着年龄的增长而变得更容易忍受。当然，你不应该相信它们，但它们不像年轻的标本那样完全受饥饿的支配。我遇到的那个人对苹果情有独钟，当我提供了三辆装满苹果的马车时，他变得欣喜若狂。然后，这个生物满足于回答我的许多问题，甚至分享它自己关于许多生物的味道和质地的一些知识--我承认我没有这些知识。虽然我认为我永远不会忘记它对像我这样的地精的味道的描述。",
	"Now a legendary creature, an adult brown dragon takes a drastically different tactical approach to combat. With its Munch attack, it can swallow a creature it is grappling with its Bite as an action or legendary action. The dragon should do this as often as possible. Any creature that succumbs while swallowed immediately dies from the Hyper Metabolism feature and healing the dragon. Note that its Dash legendary action opens up new combat opportunities when considering the dragon's many modes of movement. Hold Legendary Resistance in reserve in case the dragon needs to escape an effect that would incapacitate it or if it would regurgitate a swallowed creature.": "现在，作为一种传奇生物，成年的棕龙在战斗中采取了截然不同的战术方法。通过它的 \"大嚼 \"攻击，它可以用它的 \"咬 \"作为行动或传奇行动来吞掉正在抓捕的生物。龙应该尽可能多地这样做。任何在被吞下时屈服的生物都会因新陈代谢旺盛的特点而立即死亡，并为龙治疗。请注意，当考虑到龙的多种运动方式时，它的冲刺传奇行动开启了新的战斗机会。在龙需要逃避会使其丧失能力的效果时，或者在它会反刍被吞的生物时，请保留传奇抵抗。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - The dragon won't use Munch as a legendary action, only swallowing a creature if it can hold onto the victim until the start of the dragon's next turn. It should stay on the ground to make use of its {@sense tremorsense|MM}, keeping it in range of melee characters without handicapping itself arbitrarily.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 龙不会将 \"咀嚼 \"作为一个传奇动作，只有在它能抓住受害者直到龙的下一回合开始时才会吞下一个生物。它应该呆在地上以利用它的（%1%），使它处于近战角色的范围内，而不至于使自己任意伤残。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - The dragon will transition between aerial and ground combat. It will fly to its favorite target and grapple it with a Bite attack. It will then use its legendary actions to Dash, burrowing under the ground with its victim. It will swallow the creature before emerging, repeating the process all over again until it has consumed the entire party.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 龙将在空中和地面战斗之间转换。它将飞向它最喜欢的目标，用咬合攻击抓住它。然后它将使用它的传奇行动来冲刺，和它的受害者一起钻入地下。它将在出现之前吞下该生物，重复这个过程，直到它吞噬了整个队伍。",
	"A large town celebrates the new year by holding an extravagant feast. Hearing of the legendary banquet, an adult brown dragon has declared its intention to attend the festivities. Unsure of how to respond, the town has been preparing far more food than normal in hopes they can feed the dragon and avoid a confrontation. A long shot to be sure.": "一个大镇通过举行奢侈的盛宴来庆祝新年。听说了这一传奇性的宴会，一条成年棕龙宣布它打算参加庆典。由于不知道如何应对，镇上的人准备了比平时多得多的食物，希望能喂饱这条龙，避免发生冲突。可以肯定的是，这是一个漫长的机会。",
	"An adult brown dragon recently ate a powerful wizard, then figured the old man's potions qualified as food. Now the dragon is experiencing a startling combination of magical effects that were never meant to be combined, causing bizarre transformations, elemental eruptions, and general mayhem. The effects have been occuring for three days straight with no signs of stopping.": "一条成年棕龙最近吃了一个强大的巫师，然后认为这个老人的药水有资格作为食物。现在，这条龙正经历着惊人的魔法效果组合，这些效果本不应该结合在一起，造成了奇异的转变、元素的爆发和普遍的混乱。这些影响已经连续发生了三天，没有停止的迹象。",
	"After hibernating for a century, a brown dragon has awoken ravenously hungry to the point of near insanity. The beast is making a beeline for the nearest population center and likely won't stop there.": "在冬眠了一个世纪之后，一条棕色的龙被唤醒了，它饥饿到了近乎疯狂的地步。这只野兽正在向最近的人口中心进发，而且可能不会在那里停留。",
	"If an {@creature adult brown dragon|TPK} is able to eat its weight in food each day for 10,000 days, it will grow to become an ancient brown dragon. The gourmands of dragonkind, these massive creatures have an exquisite taste in food with an appetite to match. At this stage in life a brown dragon has sampled all confections it can find and knows what it wants. They have incredibly specific preferences that seem absurd to even the most refined palates. An ancient brown dragon's favorite food may be boiled chocolate mixed with gold and rubies or chilled elf brains in a watermelon bowl. These dishes are rarely things the dragons can get on their own, so they typically enlist a cooking staff to prepare their extensive meals. In the rare case these dragons encounter something they have not eaten, they pursue it with a hunger reminiscent of their youth. Given their impressive power at this age, nothing escapes an ancient brown dragon looking to try something new.": "如果一只{@creature adult brown dragon|TPK}能够在一万天内每天吃下其重量的食物，它将成长为一只古老的棕龙。作为龙族的美食家，这些庞大的生物对食物有着精致的品味，胃口也很好。在生命的这个阶段，棕龙已经品尝了它能找到的所有甜点，知道自己想要什么。它们有令人难以置信的特殊偏好，甚至对最精致的味觉来说都是荒谬的。一条古老的棕龙最喜欢的食物可能是混合了黄金和红宝石的煮巧克力，或者是西瓜碗里冰镇的精灵大脑。这些菜肴很少是龙族自己能得到的东西，所以他们通常会招募一个烹饪人员来准备他们的大量膳食。在极少数情况下，这些龙遇到了它们没有吃过的东西，它们会带着让人想起它们年轻时的饥饿感去追求它。鉴于他们在这个年龄段的令人印象深刻的力量，没有什么能逃过古棕龙想要尝试新东西的眼睛。",
	"If one counted all the food that has disappeared down an ancient brown dragon's gullet, you would have enough to feed an entire nation for a year. That is not an exaggeration. Their ravenous appetite has been tempered with age, but you should still never come between one and its meal. While other dragons know of ancient magic, divine secrets, and mysterious worlds, these wyrms understand a more conventional topic: food. They know everything there is to know about food and can recommend the perfect meal for any race, occasion, and palate. If they weren't so overbearing and dangerous, they would make the perfect consulting gourmand for the finest restaurants.": "如果计算所有从古老的褐龙口中消失的食物，你将有足够养活整个国家一年。这并不夸张。它们贪婪的胃口已经随着年龄的增长而有所收敛，但你仍然不应该出现在它和它的食物之间。当其他龙知道古老的魔法、神圣的秘密和神秘的世界时，这些巫妖了解一个更常规的话题：食物。他们知道关于食物的一切，可以为任何种族、场合和口味推荐完美的食物。如果他们不是那么霸道和危险，他们会成为最好的餐厅的完美顾问美食家。",
	"With almost as many hit points as a {@creature tarrasque|MM}, an ancient brown dragon is a powerhouse in combat. Note the statistical improvements across the board. Everything younger brown dragons can do, this one does better. Spellcasters are likely to run out of slots long before the dragon runs out of hit points, made all the worse by its ability to recover hit points at an astonishing rate via Hyper Metabolism. Plan for combat to last quite a few turns, and use Challenging Roar immediately to keep the battle on the dragon's terms. A save DC of 26 is tough to beat, so expect the Challenging Roar and Flensing Breath to consistently work. The dragon should always have at least one creature swallowed and can rely on its high Constitution saving throw bonus to keep itself from regurgitating.": "拥有几乎与{@creature tarrasque|MM}一样多的命中率，古棕龙在战斗中是一个强大的力量。请注意全面的统计改进。年轻的棕龙能做的一切，这只棕龙做得更好。施法者很可能在龙的命中率耗尽之前就已经用完了插槽，而它通过超级新陈代谢以惊人的速度恢复命中率的能力使情况更加糟糕。计划中的战斗将持续几个回合，并立即使用挑战吼叫来保持战斗在龙的条件下进行。拯救DC为26是很难被打败的，所以期望挑战吼叫和弗林斯呼吸能持续发挥作用。龙应该总是至少有一个生物被吞下，并且可以依靠它的高体质救赎奖励来保持自己不被反噬。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - Don't use Challenging Roar when the dragon could instead attack. Only swallow one character at a time, holding others with a grapple until it can digest them. In favor of making attacks, the dragon should grapple creatures with its claws, holding them until its ready to start its second course. Treat the entire combat like an eating contest the dragon is enjoying, at least until it gets low on hit points.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 当龙可以进行攻击时，不要使用挑战吼叫。一次只吞下一个角色，用爪子抓着其他角色直到它能消化它们。为了支持攻击，龙应该用它的爪子抓住生物，直到它准备好开始它的第二道菜。把整个战斗看成是龙在享受的一场进食比赛，至少在它的命中率低下之前。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - Open with Flensing Breath, then use legendary actions to deliver as many Claw attacks as possible. On the second turn, make sure to grapple a creature with the Bite attack, and then Munch it with legendary actions.

Use grapples to hold creatures in the Flensing Breath's area for devastating effect.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 用弗林斯呼吸开局，然后用传奇行动尽可能多地发出爪子攻击。在第二回合，确保用咬人攻击抓住一个生物，然后用传奇行动吃掉它。在第三回合，使用挑战吼叫--除非弗林斯呼吸可用，在这种情况下，你可以用它来代替--并在随后的回合中消灭任何幸存者。使用抓取器将生物抓在弗林斯呼吸的区域内，以达到破坏性的效果。",
	"A high-class, interplanar restaurant has lost its head chef, an ancient brown dragon who designed every dish they serve.

	"Nature is not a force exclusive to the material plane. Across the planes plants bloom, some of which evolve to survive harsh hellscapes of demonic realms. Such is the case with the family of plants known as demon seeds, which have not only survived, but thrived, in the lower planes. These toxic plants redefine what it means to be an invasive species. Each member of the demon seeds family is aggressive and hostile, assaulting anything that gets too close. They are primitively intelligent, slightly more aware than animals, and capable of using basic tactics in battle. THey have no grand schemes they pursue, but their biological instincts drive them to spread and reproduce, creating the appearance of coordination when they reach sufficient numbers. Having found their way to the material plane, demon seeds have given today's adventures a fresh host of reasons to fear nature.": "自然并不是物质层面独有的力量。各个位面的植物都在绽放，其中一些进化到可以在恶魔领域的严酷地狱环境中生存。被称为恶魔种子的植物家族就是这种情况，它们不仅在低层世界中生存，而且还很兴旺。这些有毒植物重新定义了入侵物种的含义。恶魔种子家族的每个成员都具有攻击性和敌意，攻击任何过于接近的东西。它们具有原始的智慧，比动物的意识稍强，能够在战斗中使用基本战术。他们没有什么宏伟的计划，但他们的生物本能驱使他们传播和繁殖，当他们达到足够的数量时，就会产生协调的外观。恶魔的种子找到了它们在物质世界的方式，给了今天的冒险家们许多新的理由来害怕自然。",
	"Demon seeds are ancient plants filled with a ravenous hunger. They seek out living beings and attempt to destroy, devour, and consume them. Their forms are varied and perfectly specialized for a specific mode of attack, honed over millennia of evolution on abyssal planes. One can see the origins of demon seeds in the plant life of the material plane. Tumbleweeds, thorny shrubs, roots, and even trees all share a common ancestry with demon seeds, though the influence of demonic energy has elevated and twisted them into the horrors we know today. They are possessed of a cold minimal sentience, just enough to get some gruesome satisfaction that only a predator can enjoy. Even druids fear groves where demon seeds grow. Well, all druids but Ionia. She fears nothing.": "恶魔的种子是古老的植物，充满了贪婪的饥饿感。它们寻找生命体，并试图摧毁、吞噬和吞噬它们。它们的形式多种多样，完美地专门用于特定的攻击方式，在深渊平面上经过数千年的进化而磨练。人们可以从物质世界的植物生命中看到恶魔种子的起源。风滚草、带刺的灌木、树根，甚至树木都与恶魔种子有着共同的祖先，尽管恶魔能量的影响将它们提升并扭曲成我们今天所知的恐怖。它们拥有冷酷的最低限度的知觉，只够获得一些可怕的满足感，只有捕食者才能享受到。甚至德鲁伊也害怕生长着恶魔种子的丛林。好吧，所有的德鲁伊，除了艾欧尼亚。她什么都不怕。",

These creatures never stop moving, and from within their rolling shape one can spot a single glowing eye that aids the deathroller in navigating its environment. Despite its enormous size, it can roll up vertical surfaces and even across liquids, allowing them to be found almost anywhere on the material plane. The speeds a deathroller can achieve are staggering, zooming across the landscape in pursuit of desperate prey.": "游荡的死亡卷轴撞向敌人并继续前进，就像一棵地狱般的风滚草，边走边把他们往地上磨。它的身体是一个由荆棘和厚厚的荆棘组成的球体，直径将近15英尺，叶子上的缝隙刚好足够猎物被缠住。这些生物从未停止过移动，从它们滚动的形状中，人们可以看到一只发光的眼睛，它可以帮助死亡卷轴在环境中导航。尽管它的体型巨大，但它可以在垂直表面上滚动，甚至可以穿过液体，这使得它们几乎可以在物质层面的任何地方被发现。死亡卷轴所能达到的速度是惊人的，它可以在景观中放大，追捕绝望的猎物。",
	"Ionia Faelindel once cultivated a crop of wandering deathrollers. She unleashed them on a horde of giants threatening her forest, and the results were devastating.

The age of a wandering deathroller can be estimated by the quantity of bones trapped in its brambles, the oldest of which rattle constantly from the hundreds of trapped remains. While deathrollers can be found anywhere plants can grow, they prefer temperate climates that have large open plains. Once a year for an entire day, a deathroller will deploy spikey seed pods that embed themselves in the earth. If another deathroller rolls over the pods, they become fertilized and germinate within a period of 5 years. A clutch of mature deathrollers will migrate as a \"flock\" far from the place of their birth, covering hundreds of miles and crushing anything in their way.": "游荡的死亡卷轴是掠夺性植物，经常以最大的速度滚动，以保持动力和保存能量。它们只有在捕获并杀死足够多的猎物以满足其饥饿感后才会停下来，直到这些生物被完全消化。流浪的死亡卷轴的年龄可以通过被困在其荆棘中的骨头数量来估计，其中最古老的骨头在数百个被困的遗体中不断发出响声。虽然在任何可以生长植物的地方都可以找到死亡卷轴，但它们更喜欢有大片开阔平原的温带气候。每年一次，整整一天，死亡卷轴会展开长满尖刺的豆荚，将自己嵌入土中。如果另一只死亡之轮滚过这些豆荚，它们就会受精，并在5年内发芽。一窝成熟的死亡卷轴将作为一个 \"群 \"迁移到远离其出生地的地方，覆盖数百英里，并粉碎任何阻碍它们的东西。",
	"Stepping into the demesne of a burrowing traproot is the last mistake of many a neophyte ranger. This plant shoots roots up from deep underground, targeting creatures it can detect with its long-range {@sense tremorsense|MM}. Those who are struck find themselves dragged underground and buried alive, easy prey for the traproot's sharp bite. In the rare moments when it can be found above ground, a traproot appears as a column of thick roots, in which is nestled a single glowing eye and gnarled maw. Hardy and patient, burrowing traproots have earned the nickname \"vanishers\" for their ambush tactics that rarely leave behind any evidence.": "踏入蔓生植物的领地是许多新手游侠的最后一个错误。这种植物从地下深处生出根来，用它的远距离（%0%）瞄准它能发现的生物。那些被击中的人发现自己被拖入地下并被活埋，很容易成为蔓生植物尖锐咬伤的猎物。在极少数情况下，当它在地面上被发现时，拖网会以一列粗大的树根出现，里面嵌着一只发光的眼睛和长满树枝的大嘴。穴居曳光虫坚韧而有耐心，因其很少留下任何证据的埋伏战术而赢得了 \"消失者 \"的绰号。",

For a single season the gimpy does not produce its acidic secretions, allowing its flowers to be pollinated. At the end of the season the gympie produces small fruits that resemble cranberries, which are highly prized by viticulturists for the flavorful wines that can be brewed with the succulent fruits. When not in this relatively peaceful state, a gympie's presence is easily noticed by the lack of fauna and acid burns on inorganic material. These trees exist only to scald and kill anything that gets within their cloud of acidic death.

	"Elemental archons are extraordinary beings that arise when the soul of a powerful mortal travels to one of the elemental planes by accident or lack of faith. Most souls sent to the elemental planes are lost and destroyed, but when a mortal of great ability passes to these planes, they become its master. The soul wraps itself in the elements, animating them under its control. This exertion of will is poorly received by the plane, and while such realms are hardly sentient, they have a natural negative reaction to authority. The soul is expelled, landing on another plane as an elemental archon.

How earth archons escape their home plane is a cause for much speculation, as their presence on the material plane is at odds with the natural order.

It is at its best in close combat with multiple foes, using its pitchfork to restrain as many foes as it can and staying just close enough to keep them in range of its Superheated Being trait. The longer the fight goes on, the more dangerous that trait becomes, both to the party and to any allies of the fire archon who aren't immune to fire damage. You should use Incinerate any time you can hit at least three targets with it. If the party has a lot of characters with resistance or immunity to fire damage, you should make using Incinerate a priority to open them up to damage from the archon's other attacks. Finally, unless the archon has a good reason to fight to the death, it should try to retreat when its Superheated Being trait reaches a radius of 40 feet. When building an encounter around a fire archon, select allied monsters with care, particularly if they are not at least resistant to fire damage.

It has been my observance that fire archons coalesce from the souls of violent warriors that fought with great passion. If you encounter one of these creatures, it's as likely to be the remnants of a bloodthirsty warlord as it is to be a warrior poet who drank too much and courted the wrong paramour.

These creatures are beings of limited existence with short life spans for which the mortal realms should be immensely thankful. However, there are legends of one who has always walked, the Ahng'el Prime, the first thought of the unknown god. Ahng'els sculpt reality into an unsolvable labyrinthian maze, locking creatures within a prison of their own shame. Many an adventurer has found themselves lost upon a path forged by a fell-ahng'el, creating a disturbing and twisted echo of divine creation once performed by its progenitor.": "食罪人、死神和世界毁灭者都是描述被称为Fell-ahng'els的可怕实体的名称。这些生物是一个不知名的神的表现，在不知名的黄昏领域中死去，是一个永恒的死亡。随着这个神的思想腐烂和衰亡，其巨大智慧的死亡之痛在现实中表现为fell-ahng'els。这些生物的存在是有限的，寿命很短，凡人界应该对此表示极大的感激。然而，有一个一直在行走的传说，即Ahng'el Prime，未知神的第一个想法。Ahng'els将现实雕刻成一个无法解决的迷宫，将生物锁在他们自己的耻辱监狱中。许多冒险者发现自己迷失在一条由Ahng'el铸造的道路上，创造了一个令人不安和扭曲的神性创造的回声，曾经由其祖先执行。",
	"A character can learn the following information about a fell-ahng'el with an Intelligence ({@skill History}) or Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) ability check.": "一个角色可以通过智力({@skill History})或智力({@skill Religion})能力检查了解有关fell-ahng'el的以下信息。",
	"The fell-ahng'els never seem to touch the ground or the walls of anywhere they are found. They float through the air with an unearthly grace, difficult to locate and even harder to catch. They are remorseless, evil, and outrageously powerful.": "在它们出现的地方，Fell-ahng'els似乎从不接触地面或墙壁。它们以一种超凡脱俗的优雅漂浮在空中，难以定位，更难以捕捉。它们是无情的、邪恶的，而且力量大得离谱。",
	"Fell-ahng'els transmute the land around them into a sanity-shattering labyrinth. Creatures who become trapped in the maze become crippingly ashamed of themselves, reduced to gibbering wrecks for the ahng'els to slaughter at its convenience.": "咒语--ahng'els把它们周围的土地变成了一个打破理智的迷宫。被困在迷宫中的生物会变得哭丧着脸，沦为胡言乱语的残骸，供ahng'els在方便时屠杀。",
	"A fell-ahng'el can locate and assault creatures over tremendous distances, sensing their footsteps and emotions with frightening precision. Only expert trackers can find a fell-ahng'el before the creature slaughters all intruders.": "陨石-ahng'el可以在很远的地方找到并攻击生物，以可怕的精确度感知它们的脚步和情绪。只有专家级的追踪者才能在生物宰杀所有入侵者之前找到fell-ahng'el。",
	"A fell-ahng'el is a difficult opponent to fight. Unless they are extraordinarily stealthy, any adventurers that approach within 1 mile of it will be quickly sensed. Once the ahng'el uses its Empathic Link feature to determine if they intend hostilities toward the ahng'el, it will unleash deadly {@spell mind spike|XGE} spells and other magic to harry and weaken the party. The ahng'el always knows its territory well and will take time to set traps with {@spell symbol} and {@spell glyph of warding}, hoping to wear intruders down and force them to rest. While they may recover from the effects of the ahng'el's assaults, creature that gain {@condition crippling shame|TPK} as a result of both feed and protect the ahng'el. An ahng'el will try to apply as many levels of this condition as possible to any creatures in the area, reducing the inhabitants to shattered husks to exploit in defense of the creature. Only then will the ahng'el move in for the kill, using its Execute feature to end a shameful existence.": "摔跤手是一个很难对付的对手。除非他们特别隐蔽，否则任何接近它1英里以内的冒险者都会被迅速察觉。一旦ahng'el使用它的移情链接功能来确定他们是否打算对ahng'el采取敌对行动，它就会释放致命的（%0%）法术和其他魔法来骚扰和削弱队伍。ahng'el总是很了解自己的领地，并会花时间用（1%）和（2%）设置陷阱，希望能让入侵者疲于奔命，迫使他们休息。虽然它们可能会从ahng'el的攻击影响中恢复过来，但那些获得（%3%）的生物，既能养活也能保护ahng'el。一个ahng'el会尽可能多地对该地区的任何生物施加这种条件，将居民减少到破碎的躯壳，以利用其来防御生物。只有到那时，ahng'el才会进入杀戮状态，使用它的 \"处决 \"功能来结束可耻的存在。",
	"If a party of heroes proves to be more than a match for the ahng'el's traps and tricks, it will allow them to find its home so that it may use its Dispersion feature. Once dispersed, most adventurers will struggle to escape the ahng'el's domain, let alone find their allies. These creatures are perfect targets for the ahng'el's abilities, and many heroes have found themselves imprisoned behind a {@spell wall of stone} for days, slowly wasting away while they await a rescue that will never come.": "如果一队英雄被证明不是ahng'el的陷阱和技巧的对手，它将允许他们找到它的家，以便它可以使用它的分散功能。一旦被驱散，大多数冒险者将很难逃离ahng'el的领域，更不用说找到他们的盟友。这些生物是ahng'el能力的完美目标，许多英雄发现自己被囚禁在{@spell wall of stone}后面好几天，在等待永远不会到来的救援时慢慢消亡。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - The ahng'el will never use its Dispersion feature, allowing the group to stay together at all times. Once engaged directly, the ahng'el will only use its {@spell maze} spell once it has been critically injured, and use the {@spell passwall} spell to escape from its attackers. The ahng'el will stay close to the ground, and likely attack the party before they accrue more than a few levels of crippling shame. It will leave a few creatures alive in its domain, preventing it from having many chances to save its own life via its Immortal Essence feature.": "{@b Easier Tactics}-ahng'el永远不会使用它的分散功能，允许群体在任何时候都保持一致。一旦直接交战，ahng'el只会在受重伤后使用它的（%1%）法术，并使用（%2%）法术来逃离攻击者。啊恩格艾尔会紧贴地面，并且很可能在党派累积超过几层残缺的耻辱之前就攻击他们。它将在自己的领域内留下一些活着的生物，防止它有很多机会通过其不朽的本质特征拯救自己的生命。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - The ahng'el won't be found unless it wants to be, hiding in frustratingly inaccessible locations within its regional effects. It will also keep many creatures imprisoned in its domain to serve as a precaution via its Immortal Essence feature. Any party that wishes to kill the ahng'el will likely have to free many of these creatures before they can engage the foul entity. Once attacked, the ahng'el opens with {@spell maze}, followed by its Dispersion feature. The creature will waste no time establishing an Empathic Link with vulnerable targets, reducing them to a critically injured state over and over until that character rests. Once a character has six levels of {@condition crippling shame|TPK}, the ahng'el moves in for the kill, fleeing once it has eliminated the target.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 除非ahng'el想被发现，否则它不会被发现，在它的区域效应中躲在令人沮丧的难以接近的地方。它还会将许多生物囚禁在它的领域内，通过其不朽的本质特征作为一种预防措施。任何想要杀死ahng'el的一方，在与这个肮脏的实体交战之前，很可能必须释放许多这样的生物。一旦受到攻击，ahng'el就会以{@spell maze}开场，然后是它的驱散功能。该生物会毫不犹豫地与脆弱的目标建立移情链接，一次又一次地将他们降低到重伤状态，直到该角色休息。一旦一个角色有六层的{@condition crippling shame|TPK}，ahng'el就会进入杀戮状态，一旦它消灭了目标就会逃离。",

	"Fell-ahng'els create dungeons and lairs wherever they go but prefer homes that make the effects of their unusual powers less suspicious. Dark dungeons, ancient forests, or abandoned cities are the preferred locales of a fell-ahng'el, often with only enough inhabitants remaining to feed the aberration's loathsome hunger for shame. Fell-ahng'els know that they are incredibly vulnerable until they can establish their regional effects, so rarely will they venture into populated areas for fear of being spotted in transit. While intelligent, a fell-ahng'el rarely cooperates with other creatures.

Those unfortunate enough to survive this process are forever changed, their powers evolving into a new fearsome array of abilities that dramatically outclass their \"normal\" counterparts.

I find that this makes them some of the most approachable and personable undead I have encountered, though I would never be such a fool as to trust one. I have learned much from the tongues of liches. Most of which I dare not repeat here. When it came to researching the mythical greater liches however, I found the normally prodigious intellect of these creatures lacking. Each lich spoke in a mixture of terror and awe, reminding me of a schoolchild that first learned of magic. Their naked ambition to attain such an existence was all too clear, but to my surprise none seemed to have a clear understanding of how to attain such a state, or even where to start.

	"A lich's signature feature is the ability to return to life after being slain, so long as its phylactery is intact. This cycle of rejuvenation can prove very troublesome for adventurers, who may have repeated encounters with the same lich until they can hunt down the object and destroy it. While this makes a lich a frustrating enemy, it does not make single encounters with the lich any more difficult. When using liches to challenge your players, we recommend that you not award them experience for defeating it unless its phylactery is destroyed. This prevents the lich from being an \"XP farm\" or causing other strange interactions with character advancement. Additionally, the challenge rating of the liches presented here does not factor in their ability to rejuvenate, as each encounter with the lich may vary wildly depending on the circumstances. The exception to this is the {@creature eternal lich|TPK}, which can recover so quickly that any encounter with the creature requires a party act swiftly to ensure the liches demise if they do not wish to face dire consequences.": "巫师的标志性特征是被杀死后能够恢复生命，只要它的法器是完整的。这种恢复活力的循环可能会给冒险者带来很大的麻烦，他们可能会反复遇到同一个巫师，直到他们能够找到这个东西并将其消灭。虽然这使巫师成为一个令人沮丧的敌人，但它并没有使与巫师的单次相遇变得更加困难。当使用巫师来挑战你的玩家时，我们建议你不要因为打败它而奖励他们经验，除非它的法器被摧毁。这可以防止巫师成为 \"XP农场\"，或者与角色的发展产生其他奇怪的互动。此外，这里介绍的地衣的挑战等级并没有考虑到它们的复活能力，因为每次遇到地衣都会因情况不同而有很大的差异。这方面的例外是{@creature eternal lich|TPK}，它的恢复能力如此之强，以至于在遇到这种生物时，如果他们不想面对可怕的后果，就必须迅速采取行动以确保地衣的死亡。",
	"True love is a beautiful thing. It is also completely incompatible with the nature of a lich, whose evil existence rebels against an emotion of such purity and goodness. Should a lich come to love a powerful spellcaster with naked and humble sincerity and be loved in turn, the foul magic that maintains their existence cannot abide. At the moment of their first embrace, both lovers are merged in a foul necromantic display. Body, mind, and soul are stitched together, eternally cursed in a twisted perversion of true love - A paramour lich. Now possessed of a selfish love, the lich fights with overwhelming magic to protect what little fragment is left of its affections.": "真爱是一件美丽的事情。它也与巫师的本性完全不相容，巫师邪恶的存在与如此纯洁和善良的情感相悖。如果一个巫师以赤裸裸的、谦卑的诚意去爱一个强大的施法者，并反过来被爱，维持他们存在的邪恶的魔法就无法忍受了。在他们第一次拥抱的那一刻，这对恋人都被融合在一个肮脏的亡灵魔法表演中。身体、思想和灵魂被缝合在一起，在一个扭曲的变态真爱中被永远地诅咒--一个姘妇巫师。现在拥有了自私的爱，巫师用压倒性的魔法战斗，以保护它的感情所剩无几的碎片。",

These liches are oddly dysfunctional, speaking over each other and bickering at every opportunity. I theorize that this pseudo-insanity is some kind of curse, a magical contract that binds two souls together, intimate but incapable of true love. I asked Johan his opinion on such matters and whether or note such a pact could be severed. Even with his expertise as a warlock and access to my considerable library, he could devise no such method.

When a dragon makes the unfortunate choice to become a dracolich, it gaints the potential to live forever, and in the process amasses more wealth that would make even the most ancient of dragons envious. While this may seem like a dragon's dream come true, it is a trap.

	"Remember the eternal lich is psionic, generating spells without the need for any components. This can make combat with the lich incredibly confusing, as many of the effects appear to generate from thin air or without any effort on the lich's part.

If facing serious foes, the lich will unleash its Death Bomb before unleashing a fresh wave of {@spell disintegrate} spells.": "记住，永恒的巫师是有灵性的，不需要任何组件就能产生法术。这可能会使与巫师的战斗变得非常混乱，因为许多效果似乎是凭空产生的，或者说巫师没有任何努力。它的生命感应功能可以探测到任何生物的存在，防止敌人隐藏起来或出其不意地攻击巫师。如果面对严重的敌人，巫师会在释放新一波{@spell disintegrate}的法术之前释放它的死亡炸弹。",

	"{@b Harder Tactics} - The lich will begin combat with a {@spell synaptic static|XGE} and {@spell psychic scream|XGE}, using its first set of legendary actions on its Power Overwhelming feature. Once it has gained these benefits, it will use its Death Bomb feature on the next turn for catastrophic damage. It will then throw the characters into the Death Bomb's effect with True Telekinesis, using {@spell mass suggestion} to prevent any allies from aiding beleaguered creatures. If injured below half its hit point maximum, the lich will use {@spell negative energy flood|XGE} to heal itself at least once per round as a legendary action.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 巫师将以{@spell synaptic static|XGE}和{@spell psychic scream|XGE}开始战斗，在它的力量压倒性特征上使用它的第一组传奇行动。一旦它获得了这些好处，它将在下一回合使用它的死亡炸弹功能，以获得灾难性的伤害。然后，它将用真正的心灵感应将角色扔进死亡炸弹的效果中，使用（%3%）来阻止任何盟友援助被围困的生物。如果伤害低于其最大命中率的一半，巫师将使用（%4%）来治疗自己，每回合至少一次，作为一个传奇动作。",

Their lairs are well hidden, affording them access to a healthy number of vessels to possess and amount of political influence to wield. Most creatures that work on behalf of an eternal lich rarely know they are doing so. And that is just the way the lich likes it.

It is cold, emotionless, and ruthlessly logical, a temperament mastered after millennia of evil.": "一个永恒的巫师拥有世界上所有的时间来完成它的目标。他们的目标总是深远的，他们的总体计划的每一步都是提前几个世纪就确定的。他们的巢穴隐藏得很好，使他们有机会拥有大量的船只和政治影响力。大多数代表永恒的巫师工作的生物很少知道他们在这样做。而这正是巫师喜欢的方式。当在公开场合运作时，永恒的巫师是一股可怕的力量，可以肆无忌惮地破坏。它能迅速地奴役有用的棋子，处置无价值或令人失望的爪牙。它冷酷无情，没有感情，而且无情地具有逻辑性，这是经过几千年的邪恶后掌握的一种气质。",
	"Far beneath the surface of the ocean where the sun has never shone lurk the hadala-lafeda. These cunning and mysterious fey prey upon humanoids, using fearsome magic to drag countless sailors to a watery grave. More than a few tales of sea monsters and haunted waters can be attributed to the hadala-lafeda, who strike without warning. Alien nightmares that shatter the resolve of the most stalwart paladin, these fey bring bizarre and frightening power to bear against the surface world. Their civilizations are ancient, with a culture and language obscured from all recorded history.

I consider it a matter of course to remain on dry land, well away from the many terrors that lurk below the thunders of the upper deep. But those terrors make their influence known upon the surface world at times, and it falls to scholars like myself to catalogue their abilities so we might be better prepared. Of these threats, the Hadala-Lafeda are paramount. An organized society of fey dwells in the darkest ocean pits, capable of manipulating water and minds with equal skill. I count this race of vicious fey as another fantastic reason why the ocean cannot be trusted.": "我认为，如果我们是为了探索海洋深处，我们就会有鳃。因为我最后一次检查，我们没有。我认为留在干燥的陆地上是理所当然的，远离潜伏在上层深海雷声之下的许多恐怖。但是，这些可怕的东西有时会在地面世界产生影响，像我这样的学者有责任对它们的能力进行分类，以便我们能有更好的准备。在这些威胁中，Hadala-Lafeda是最重要的。一个有组织的异族社会居住在最黑暗的海坑里，能够以同样的技巧操纵水和思想。我把这个邪恶的费伊人种族看作是海洋不可信任的另一个奇妙原因。",

Of course, they were there to bludgeon me unconscious because I had an overdue book from the College of Lore's library, but their willingness to indulge in a bit of music before battle gave me hope for mortal-celestial relations.

Those lucky enough to survive their wrathful parents venture into a world full of danger and enemies to fight. A newborn imperial dragon quickly develops its body for maximum lethality.

Imperial dragons see these as trophies or badges of honor and are willing to endure grievous injuries to elevate their status.": "每一百个真龙蛋中就有一个孵化成帝王龙，无论其父母是什么物种。那些幸运地从愤怒的父母手中幸存下来的龙，将进入一个充满危险和敌人的世界。新生的帝王龙迅速发展自己的身体，以达到最大的杀伤力。随着年龄的增长，龙的身体会因战斗而留下残酷的伤痕。帝王龙将这些视为战利品或荣誉的标志，并愿意忍受严重的伤害以提高他们的地位。",
	"The imperial dragon race shares a collective aspiration and goal. Believing themselves superior to other dragons and extremely superior to non-dragons, imperial dragons seek to unite all dragons as rulers of all lesser beings. To them, it is natural and evident that the world should be ordered, for a dragon can become one of the most powerful beings in existence by simply growing old. I have learned of an ancienty prophecy foretelling the coming of the Dragon Sovereign, a dragon with power radical enough to unite all of dragonkind and assume dominion over our world. All imperial dragons believe in this prophecy with a frightening zeal, each seeking to become the Dragon Sovereign, which explains the almost psychotic obsession they have with violence. Thankfully, no official Dragon Sovereign has been declared, but dragons with whom I have spoken reverently utter the name \"Ultraxus\" and refuse to elaborate further.": "帝王龙族有一个共同的愿望和目标。认为自己比其他龙优越，比非龙极度优越，帝王龙试图将所有龙联合起来，成为所有较小生命的统治者。对他们来说，世界应该是有秩序的，这很自然，也很明显，因为龙只要变老就能成为现存最强大的生命之一。我了解到一个古老的预言，预示着龙王的到来，一个拥有强大力量的龙，足以联合所有的龙族，对我们的世界进行统治。所有的帝国龙都以一种可怕的热情相信这个预言，每个人都在寻求成为龙王，这也解释了他们对暴力的近乎疯狂的迷恋。值得庆幸的是，还没有正式的龙族统治者被宣布，但与我交谈过的龙都虔诚地说出 \"Ultraxus \"这个名字，并拒绝进一步说明。",

	"To avoid combat with an imperial dragon, it is best to appear as weak and helpless as possible. Displays of power and strength will likely provoke the dragon into attacking just for the fun of it.": "为了避免与帝王龙作战，最好是尽可能地表现得软弱无助。权力和力量的展示可能会激起龙的攻击，只是为了好玩。",

They have no weaknesses, know no fear, and unleash disintegrating beams of force from their jaws.": "帝国龙将自己的身体训练得非常完美。它们比普通的龙强得多--它们的所有能力都是专门为战斗而设计的。它们没有弱点，不知道恐惧，并从它们的下颚释放出瓦解的力束。",
	"Unlike other dragons, imperial dragons do not hoard treasure. What currency they acquire on their adventures is swiftly spent on making themselves more dangerous, and an imperial dragon never pays for what it could take anyway (which is most things). However, imperial dragon body parts are extremely valuable when harvested and can be used to make equipment, such as {@item imperial dragon fang|TPK|imperial dragon fangs}, or used as spell components. The larger the dragon, the more material can be harvested from its body. Forging equipment from imperial dragon body parts requires considerable time, materials, and skill possessed by only the most experienced of artisans.": "与其他龙不同，帝王龙不囤积财宝。它们在冒险中获得的货币会迅速用于使自己变得更加危险，而且帝王龙从不为它能拿的东西买单（这也是大多数东西）。然而，帝王龙的身体部位在收获后是非常有价值的，可以用来制造装备，比如（%0%），或者用作法术组件。龙的体型越大，可以从它的身体里收获的材料就越多。用帝王龙的身体部位锻造装备需要相当多的时间、材料和技能，只有最有经验的工匠才能拥有。",

Doing so requires 36 hours of strenuous activity and proficiency in {@item leatherworker's tools|PHB}.

	"Imperial dragons are nomads and adventurers, remarkably busy for their kind. They can be found anywhere provided something interesting piques their curiosity. This something usually takes the form of a dangerous creature that promises a good fight. ANything with a reputation for power and skill in battle will inevitably draw an imperial dragon looking for a challenge. Evil imperial dragons will devastate the lands they visit in titanic conflicts, while neutral and good dragons will give a bit more consideration toward the impact their presence has on the world. When given the choice, imperial dragons prefer spacious areas that allow them to exercise and practice without being disturbed. This makes them remarkably easy to find (simply follow the sound of a dragon battling), but few want to risk approaching these fearsome creatures, lest they be considered worthy foes.": "帝国龙是游牧民族和冒险家，对于他们的同类来说，是非常忙碌的。只要有有趣的东西激起他们的好奇心，他们就能在任何地方找到。这种东西通常以危险生物的形式出现，承诺会有一场精彩的战斗。任何以力量和战斗技巧著称的东西都会不可避免地吸引帝王龙来寻求挑战。邪恶的帝王龙会在巨大的冲突中摧毁它们所到之处的土地，而中立和善良的龙会更多地考虑它们的存在对世界的影响。如果有选择的话，帝王龙更喜欢宽敞的地方，使它们能够在不被打扰的情况下进行锻炼和练习。这使得它们非常容易被找到（只需跟随龙战斗的声音），但很少有人愿意冒险接近这些可怕的生物，以免它们被视为值得尊敬的敌人。",
	"Younger dragons need not travel far to find those worthy foes. The older an imperial dragon gets, the harder it becomes to find things worth killing. This makes the oldest among them wayfarers and explorers of the finest caliber, adept at tracking and adventuring to rival the most grizzled rangers.": "年轻的龙不需要走很远就能找到那些值得杀的敌人。帝王龙的年龄越大，就越难找到值得杀戮的东西。这使得他们中最年长的人成为最优秀的航海家和探险家，善于追踪和冒险，可与最老练的游侠相媲美。",
	"While far mightier than wyrmlings of other dragons, infant imperial dragons know they are at their weakest. Cunning and elusive, these dragons shrewdly assess every creature they come across as a potential threat. Eager to prove themselves, wyrmlings are quick to set out on their own and attack anything they think will give them a good fight. However, they are anything but reckless.

	"I am astounded as to how these tenacious dragons can hatch from any true dragon species. It would be like if a gnome gave birth to an orc! After encountering an infant imperial dragon, I have nothing but sympathy for the parents. Its violent habits and obstinate nature would certainly make it the \"problem child\" in any family unit. When you are dealing with dragons, this extreme nature gets magnified tenfold. I doubt even the most savage red or overbearing gold could keep a handle on these wyrmlings, a thought that is equal parts entertaining and terrifying.": "我对这些顽强的龙如何能从任何真正的龙种中孵化出来感到震惊。这就好比地精生下一个兽人一样! 在遇到一条幼年的帝王龙后，我对其父母只有同情。它的暴力习性和顽固性肯定会使它成为任何家庭单位中的 \"问题儿童\"。当你和龙打交道时，这种极端的性质会被放大十倍。我怀疑即使是最野蛮的红龙或最霸道的金龙也能控制住这些小龙，这种想法既有趣又可怕。",

To fall at such a young age is a shameful death for an imperial dragon, so wyrmlings never pick a fight they are unlikely to win. These dragons use their impressive speed to stay away from dangerous opponents and harry vulnerable enemies. Their small (for a dragon) size allows them to make good use of cover as they dart about the battlefield. A wyrmling will gladly provoke an attack of opportunity if it means it will avoid staying close to melee foes for an entire round.

Only titanic effort, considerable luck, and brilliant planning afford a chance at success. Such power teaches us that no matter what we achieve, no matter how mighty we become, there is always something greater. If there is an answer to what is the strongest being in existence, these dragons will become it.": "我现在明白为什么其他龙对这个物种感到谦卑了。如果我知道每个人都有成为如此可怕的生物的潜力{@creature imperial dragon wyrmling|TPK|wyrmling}，我在最初的判断中就不会那么仁慈了。在我写这篇文章的时候，我很难想象可敬的帝王龙会有什么弱点。没有任何咒语、刀剑或秘技能让它们低头。只有巨大的努力、可观的运气和出色的计划才能提供成功的机会。这种力量告诉我们，无论我们取得什么成就，无论我们变得多么强大，总是有更大的东西存在。如果有一个关于什么是存在的最强者的答案，这些龙将成为它。",
	"Ancient imperial dragons are massive, far larger than most other creatures. They dominate the battlefield with their presence. Nothing is beyond their reach, and no defense is proof against their attacks. Even the most powerful of characters are lucky to survive a round or two of concentrated damage from one of these dragons, and those who do will forever bear the scars to prove it. In any conflict, the dragon will know exactly who it needs to kill and in exactly what order to best guarantee victory. An ancient imperial dragon accepts nothing but absolute victory against those at whom it bares its teeth. Enemies with powerful tools such {@spell resurrection} or other manners of cheating death are swiftly hunted down and exterminated, as survivors are a dishonorable stain upon the dragon's reputation.": "古代帝王龙体型庞大，远比大多数其他生物要大。它们以自己的存在主宰着整个战场。没有任何东西是它们所能触及的，也没有任何防御措施可以抵御它们的攻击。即使是最强大的角色，能从这些龙的一两轮集中伤害中幸存下来也是幸运的，而那些幸存下来的人将永远带着伤疤来证明这一点。在任何冲突中，龙会清楚地知道它需要杀死谁，以及以何种顺序来最好地保证胜利。一条古老的帝王龙只接受对它呲牙咧嘴的人的绝对胜利。拥有强大工具（%0%）或其他欺骗死亡的方式的敌人会被迅速追捕和消灭，因为幸存者是龙的声誉上的一个不光彩的污点。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - The dragon immediately uses its Breath Weapons and Dreadful Visage. Should that prove to not immediately shatter a party's resolve, the dragon will reward their resilience by battling like a punch-drunk warrior, \"playing\" more than fighting. This behavior is eerily similar to a cat playing with a mouse. The dragon will waste actions to demonstrate its absolute superiority, crushing a character's defenses before cleaving them into unconsciousness.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 龙会立即使用它的呼吸武器和可怕的面容。如果事实证明这并没有立即击溃一方的决心，龙会通过像一个喝醉了的战士一样的战斗来奖励他们的韧性，\"玩 \"多于战。这种行为与猫玩老鼠极为相似。龙会浪费行动来证明它的绝对优势，在把一个角色劈成无意识之前粉碎他们的防御。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - The dragon has several lifetimes of experience to draw upon in battle, and it shows. Use any strategies from younger imperial dragons which you feel will be the most effective. The dragon takes particular delight in immediately dismantling any strategy or defense concocted by its attackers. A well-played imperial dragon is never the one being attacked—it is the hunter and all the world its prey. At best a party can expect to be assaulted before they have a chance to prepare, the dragon having anticipated their every effort well in advance. The dragon has nothing to prove, and if its enemies can't offer resistance while at their worst, they don't deserve to face the dragon at their best.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 这条龙有几辈子的经验可以在战斗中借鉴，这一点很明显。使用任何你认为最有效的年轻帝国龙的策略。御龙特别喜欢立即瓦解攻击者制定的任何策略或防御。一条玩得好的帝王龙从来不是被攻击的一方，它是猎人，全世界都是它的猎物。在最好的情况下，一方可以预期在他们有机会准备之前被攻击，龙已经提前预料到他们的每一次努力。龙没有什么可证明的，如果它的敌人在最差的时候不能提供抵抗，他们就不值得在最好的时候面对龙。",

	"The darkness that lurks in the hearts of mortals makes itself known in many ways, and few are as vile as mob justice. When the masses skirt the law, ignore systems of justice, and choose to end a life over a personal vendetta, the result can be something monstrous. The victim's lifeblood drains into the earth, suffused with their anguish and a thirst for vengeance. Should the roots of a moss oak drink deeply from this blood, the spirit of the victim merges with the tree's gnarled form, granting it tremendous power and a cruel sentience. These colossal creatures are known as lynchwoods, and their punishing nooses have brought countless guilt-ridden folk to a grisly end. With supernatural senses and incredible strength, lynchwoods are rightly feared by all who have committed evil acts and gotten away with it—or so they thought.": "潜伏在凡人心中的黑暗以多种方式展现出来，很少有像暴民正义那样卑鄙的。当大众绕过法律，无视司法系统，选择因个人恩怨而结束生命时，其结果可能是可怕的。受害者的生命之血流进了大地，充斥着他们的痛苦和对复仇的渴望。如果苔藓橡树的根部深深地喝下这些血，受害者的精神就会与这棵树的参天大树融为一体，赋予它巨大的力量和残忍的知觉。这些巨大的生物被称为 \"私刑\"，它们的惩罚性绞索已经将无数有罪的人带入了可怕的结局。由于具有超自然的感觉和难以置信的力量，所有犯下邪恶行为并逃脱惩罚的人都会对绞刑架感到恐惧，或者他们认为是这样。",
	"Creation mythologies frequently state murder was the first evil act. Without delving too deeply into the philosophical and epistemological debate surrounding the taking of life, it is sufficient to say most societies disapprove of it and take steps to prevent murder from occurring. However, I have all too often witnessed supposedly \"civilized\" societies form an angry mob in pursuit of an alleged wrongdoer, too blinded by hate to allow for the function of law, or sometimes even to distinguish between guilty and innocent! It is the sad fates of such innocents that give rise to the lynchwoods. These creatures are supernatural avatars of vengeance, ensuring that those who commit evil acts be punished with a deserving fate. I recommend to any who live with the guilt of evil upon their souls that they turn themselves in. Even the most iron-hearted paladin is more forgiving then a lynchwood's cruel noose.": "创世神话中经常说谋杀是第一个邪恶的行为。在不深入研究围绕夺取生命的哲学和认识论争论的情况下，只需说大多数社会不赞成它，并采取措施防止谋杀的发生。然而，我经常看到所谓的 \"文明 \"社会组成愤怒的暴徒来追捕被指控的不法分子，他们被仇恨蒙蔽了双眼，无法发挥法律的作用，有时甚至无法区分有罪和无罪！这些人的命运是可悲的。正是这些无辜者的悲惨命运导致了私刑的出现。这些生物是复仇的超自然化身，确保那些犯下邪恶行为的人得到应有的惩罚。我建议任何带着邪恶的罪孽生活在自己灵魂中的人去自首。即使是最铁石心肠的圣骑士，也比私刑的残酷绞索更宽松。",

Your goal is to get the majority of the party within 200 feet of the executioner so that it can make Ensnare attacks. The effects of Ensnare combined with Hoist are deadly, decapitating characters in a few short rounds. The executioner has a host of other powerful effects in play. Use Bite to swallow troublesome melee characters that refuse to be strangled, and disrupt frustrating magical effects with Drain Magic. The executioner has a ton of hit points across all of its sections, so it can afford to play the long game for the right moment to strike.

Sentient creatures find living near these creatures almost impossilbe, as their reach extends for miles due to an expansive root system. A bloodbark's wailing cacophony is unsettling to all who hear it, and only the bravest or most insane knowingly inhabit their domain.

Called maleophages by those unlucky enough to encounter them, these sentient plagues assault the living where they are most vulnerable. They inflict the body, mind, and even soul with their corrosive presence, tearing even the most stalwart adventurer apart from the inside. Maleophages are inherently evil, taking a perverse glee in the suffering their symptoms inflict. All attempts to purge the \"living plagues\" from the world have utterly failed. Only the most daring and powerful can put an end to a maleophage infection. All it takes is for one infected individual to escape quarantine for the threat to rise anew, a threat made all the more likely by a maleophage's cruel intelligence.": "这些活生生的疾病体积微小，能够在短短几秒钟内渗透到一个生物的身体形态中，它们是如此强大，可以推翻一个泰坦。那些不幸遇到它们的人称之为maleophages，这些有生命力的瘟疫袭击了生物最脆弱的地方。它们对身体、思想、甚至灵魂都有腐蚀作用，即使是最坚强的冒险家也会被它们从内部撕裂。Maleophages本质上是邪恶的，他们对自己的症状所造成的痛苦感到反常的高兴。所有将 \"活瘟疫 \"从世界上清除的尝试都彻底失败了。只有最大胆和最强大的人才能结束恶性肿瘤感染。只要有一个受感染的人逃出隔离区，威胁就会重新出现，由于恶性肿瘤的残酷智能，这种威胁就更有可能出现。",
	"Four species of maleophage have been catalogued, each unique in the way it corrupts and invades the body. Magical countermeasures against disease are only partially effective against them, and massively increased doses are recommended. Some of these microscopic oozes defy detection, lying dormant until they suddenly liquify their host from the inside. Furthermore, the self-sustaining nature of the maleophages allows them to survive beyond the death of their hosts, preventing the amelioration of symptoms one normally sees in a contagion. You see, normally a disease that kills its host too quickly has no chance to spread, while those strains which can survive even postmortem are often the deadliest and most terrifying of all.": "四种恶性肿瘤病毒已被编入目录，每一种都有其独特的腐蚀和入侵身体的方式。针对疾病的魔法对策对它们只有部分效果，建议大量增加剂量。其中一些微观的渗出物无视检测，一直处于休眠状态，直到它们突然从内部液化了它们的宿主。此外，恶性肿瘤的自我维持性质使它们在宿主死亡后仍能存活，阻止了人们在传染病中通常看到的症状改善。你看，通常情况下，太快杀死宿主的疾病没有机会传播，而那些甚至在死后还能存活的菌株往往是最致命和最可怕的。",

	"This strain of maleophage warps the mind of its host, urging the afflicted on toward violence against former friends. It corrupts the flesh of the host as well, amplifying wounds and setting bones in horribly broken positions. Those who suffer from twisting hate become hideously deformed, their bodies contorted into excruciating angles.

	"The variety of maleophage called twisting hate is so named for its ability to inspire hatred in the thoughts of its host, turning friend to foe in an instant. As with all maleophages, it is best expunged through liberal application of divine magics. Unfortunately, a twisting hate is nigh impossible to locate until it has infected a host, forcing those who week its destruction to experience excruciating agony.

The infected creature attempts a Constitution saving throw each turn to try to expel the ooze, and the ooze starts attacking from within immediately.

You can even use the movement from Delirium to keep the host and allies separated, potentially damaging the twisting hate if the afflicted character succeeds on the Constitution saving throw at the start of each turn.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 每回合使用谵妄，在战斗中只使用酸性呕吐物一次。专注于使用谵妄来移动，总体上减少攻击。你甚至可以利用谵妄带来的移动来保持宿主和盟友的分离，如果受影响的角色在每回合开始时的体质救赎成功，就有可能伤害到扭曲的仇恨。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - Use Toxic Shock repeatedly to weaken the host. Each use of the ability threatens to activate Fleshwarping and reduce the host's hit point maximum, and it limits the rest of the party's ability to do damage to the twisting hate by attacking the host—unless they're fine with killing their friend, of course. Once the host has been killed, move onto the next most vulnerable until nothing is left standing.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 反复使用毒性冲击来削弱宿主。每次使用该能力都会威胁到激活肉搏战，并降低宿主的最大命中率，而且它限制了其他党员通过攻击宿主对扭曲的仇恨造成伤害的能力--当然，除非他们对杀死自己的朋友没有意见。一旦宿主被杀，就转到下一个最脆弱的地方，直到什么都不剩为止。",

	"Most commonly found in forests near groups of humanoids, a twisting hate is just sentient enough to be patient. It lurks in the bodies of weaker creatures, waiting until it finds a powerful creature to corrupt and bring under its sway. After killing everything nearby, it turns dormant, as it is incapable of moving without a host body to carry it. It prefers highly trafficked areas where a new host is never far away. While sentient, a twisting hate is beyond reason or compassion. Only those who possess telepathy have engaged a twisting hate in conversation, which is reported to only result in a ceaseless tide of insults, threats, and general vitriol from the angry disease.

	"A silent killer that strikes without warning, death wrack is the subtlest of the maleophages.

It is surprisingly intelligent and acts with malignant purpose, seeking out individuals in positions of influence and power and hiding within them until a crucial moment when it can strike them dead. A death wrack is almost impossible to identify until after it has struck, its victims showing no outward symptoms until it is too late. Those who suffer an attack from death wrack experience excruciating pain in their chests before collapsing.

Though each Nartheneen is born into a caste, through an arcane ritual they can transmute their bodies into new forms better suited to their aptitudes.": "很久以前，有一个拥有至高无上的权威和深厚的魔法力量的种族--纳特尼恩。他们的沙漠帝国是沙漠中的一颗明珠，各种奇迹从这里流淌出来。今天，他们的文明只剩下了废墟，但一些学者认为纳特尼恩人的小部分仍然存在。纳尔特人的特征是膝盖向后弯曲的长腿，每只手有六个手指，以及动物的头，他们不可能在现代社会中不被注意。他们的文化是由严格的功利主义和明确界定但高度流动的种姓制度定义的，每个种姓的成员都以用动物的头来代替他们的头为标志。虽然每个纳特尼恩人都出生在一个种姓中，但通过一种神秘的仪式，他们可以将自己的身体转化为更适合他们能力的新形式。",
	"There are six castes, divided into three \"lesser\" and three \"greater\" castes, although the words are imperfectly translated from the Nartheneen language. More accurately, the \"lesser\" castes are many in number and fulfill the most fundamental needs of the society: food, infrastructure, and trade. The \"greater\" castes are restricted to the most exceptional individuals and cover the loftier pursuits of scholas, priests, and warriors. It is noteworthy that the most combat-capable Nartheneen are among the greater castes, implying the significance of war in their society.": "有六个种姓，分为三个 \"小 \"种姓和三个 \"大 \"种姓，尽管这些词从纳特尼恩语中翻译过来并不完美。更准确地说，\"小 \"种姓人数众多，满足社会最基本的需求：食物、基础设施和贸易。而 \"大 \"种姓只限于最杰出的个人，涵盖了学者、牧师和战士等更高层次的追求。值得注意的是，最有战斗力的纳特恩人属于大种姓，这意味着战争在他们社会中的重要性。",
	"Up front, let me state that the theory that the Nartheneen are the progenitors of all modern humanoids is rubbish. The testimony of a group of adventurers who claim to have traveled back to and from the height of the Nartheneen civilization is hardly scholarly. With that clarified, the Nartheneen are nonetheless a fascinating and study in differing cultural norms and well worthy of consideration. Their meritocracy was relentless, and each caste believed itself to be the most essential to its society's function. Yet they bore no ill will toward the other castes, for they were all aware that the others felt as they did. It was this common feeling of utmost importance that paradoxically united them, allowing them to act with coordination toward common goals.": "首先，让我声明，纳特尼恩人是所有现代人类的祖先的理论是垃圾。一群冒险家声称曾往返于纳特尼恩文明的高峰期，他们的证词很难说是学术性的。在澄清了这一点之后，纳特尼恩人仍然是一个迷人的、关于不同文化规范的研究，非常值得考虑。他们的功利主义是无情的，每个种姓都认为自己是社会功能中最重要的。然而，他们对其他种姓并无恶意，因为他们都知道其他种姓的感受与他们一样。正是这种最重要的共同感觉，矛盾地将他们团结起来，使他们能够为共同的目标协调行动。",
	"It was also this unity that ruined them, I'm afraid. A foul entity called the Ebon Flame, the details of which remain vague even under my scrutiny, corrupted them with the promise of great magics—a promise it delivered upon but which carried a cost beyond imagining. Even now, I have several of my associates keeping watch for mentions of this Ebon Flame. If it ever returns to our world, we will be ready.": "恐怕也正是这种统一性毁了他们。一个被称为 \"伊本之火 \"的邪恶实体，其细节即使在我的审视下也是模糊的，它用伟大的魔法的承诺腐蚀了他们--它兑现了承诺，但却付出了无法想象的代价。即使是现在，我的几个同事也一直在关注着关于这个伊本之火的消息。如果它有一天回到我们的世界，我们会做好准备。",
	"For further reading on the Nartheneen and the lingering impact of their poor decisions, consult {@i The Lion's Vault} by Jorvis Nesros, a scholar at the University of Archensheen. While his account of interactions with the Nartheneen may bring his sanity into question, I have generally found his extrapolations and scientific conclusions sound.": "关于纳特希恩人的进一步阅读，以及他们的错误决定所带来的挥之不去的影响，请参考阿肯希恩大学的学者乔维斯-内斯罗斯（%0%）。虽然他对与纳特希恩的互动的叙述可能会使他的理智受到质疑，但我总体上认为他的推断和科学结论是合理的。",
	"While the Nartheneen eschewed deity-centric religions, they paid reverence to three forces they saw as essential to life. Each was represented by a single word in the Nartheneen language but is best expressed as a hyphenated compound in Common: Waters-of-Life, Scorching-Light, and Mother-Source. Some Nartheneen were gifted with an affinity for channeling water magic, and they were called the river-blessed. Waters-of-Life was in many ways the \"good\" in the Nartheneen view of good versus evil, and the river-blessed were seen as healers and saints.": "虽然纳特尼恩人摒弃了以神灵为中心的宗教，但他们对三种力量表示敬意，认为它们对生命至关重要。每一种力量在纳特尼恩语言中都由一个词来代表，但在普通话中最好用连字符的复合词来表达：生命之水、炙热之光和母亲之源。一些纳尔特尼恩人具有引导水魔法的天赋，他们被称为受河流祝福的人。生命之水在很多方面都是纳特斯尼人善恶观中的 \"善\"，而受河水祝福的人被视为治疗师和圣人。",
	"Only members of the \"lesser\" castes could be river-blessed, identified by their animal heads: crocodile, feline, and hippopotamus. Crocodiles were the builders, capable of raising great edifices in mere moments and skilled at shaping battlefields. Those with feline heads were members of the merchant class, expert traders and, in a fight, not above cheating and conniving. Hippopotamus Nartheneen were stewards, responsible for agriculture and the physical health of others; they were menders and healers when called to take up arms.": "只有 \"低等 \"种姓的成员才能得到河流的祝福，他们以动物的头颅来识别：鳄鱼、猫科动物和河马。鳄鱼是建设者，能够在短短的时间内建造出伟大的建筑，并能熟练地塑造出战场。那些长着猫科动物脑袋的人是商人阶层的成员，是专业的商人，在战斗中，不排除欺骗和纵容。河马的Nartheneen是管家，负责农业和其他人的身体健康；当被要求拿起武器时，他们是修补师和医护人员。",

Hippo river-blessed have the ability to mend wounds and ward a large number of allies against damage for a short time.": "鳄鱼种姓的受河水影响的人可以在瞬间升起石墙，分割他们的敌人，他们引导水来破坏一个敌人。那些猫科动物种姓的人是熟练的盗贼，甚至可以解除一个经验丰富的老手的武装。他们的水魔法带来了密集的泥浆，使他们的敌人在很大的范围内衰弱。受河马影响的人有能力修补伤口，并在短时间内抵御大量盟友的伤害。",
	"River-blessed need allies to deal damage. They are support creatures, able to debilitate enemies and create favorable situations for their allies. Alone, they aren't much of a threat. The river-blessed have some abilities in common in all their incarnations, so we'll start with those. You should use Warding of the River against powerful, single-target hits like a paladin's {@classFeature Divine Smite|Paladin|PHB|2}, a rogue's {@classFeature Sneak Attack|Rogue|PHB|1}, or a critical hit. It also works well against spells like {@spell disintegrate}. Don't be too stingy about it—you need to use it every round to accumulate enough prevented damage to make good use of Summon the Flood. In general, use Summon the Flood after preventing 40 to 50 damage.": "无河的人需要盟友来造成伤害。他们是辅助生物，能够削弱敌人，并为他们的盟友创造有利的局面。单独行动时，它们并不构成什么威胁。无河的人在他们所有的化身中都有一些共同的能力，所以我们将从这些能力开始。你应该使用守护之河来对付强大的单目标攻击，如圣骑士的{@classFeature Divine Smite|Paladin|PHB|2}、流氓的{@classFeature Sneak Attack|Rogue|PHB|1}，或关键攻击。它对像{@spell disintegrate}这样的法术也很有效。不要对它太吝啬--你需要每一轮都使用它来积累足够的防止伤害，以便很好地利用 \"召唤洪水\"。一般来说，在防止了40到50次伤害后再使用 \"召唤洪水\"。",
	"Beyond that, each variety of river-blessed has different tactics:": "除此以外，每个品种的河北人都有不同的战术。",
	"Crocodile caste use We Are Builders on their first turn to cast {@spell wall of stone} and split the party. Though the river-blessed doesn't have to worry about losing concentration due to taking damage, it is still vulnerable to {@spell dispel magic}.

Use Summon the Flood on dangerous characters like spellcasters, paladins, or raging barbarians, because even if they succeed on their saving throws, they're going to lose a turn.": "鳄鱼种姓在第一回合使用 \"我们是建设者 \"施放（%0%），并分裂队伍。虽然无河的人不必担心因受到伤害而失去注意力，但仍然容易受到（%1%）的伤害。在升起城墙后，无河的人应该根据队伍的组成选择专注于近战或远程攻击，使用远程攻击来扰乱施法者，在近身战斗中受到威胁时使用近战攻击。对法术师、圣骑士或愤怒的野蛮人等危险角色使用 \"召唤洪水\"，因为即使他们的蓄力成功，也会失去一个回合。",
	"Feline caste river-blessed work best in melee combat, using their Sleight of Paw trait to purloin items from the party, focusing on relieving martial characters of their magical weapons. Use Summon the Flood to hit at least two characters without damaging any allies.": "猫科动物种姓的河神在近战中发挥了最好的作用，利用其狡猾的爪子特质从队伍中偷取物品，重点是解除武将角色的魔法武器。使用 \"召唤洪水\"，在不伤害任何盟友的情况下，至少能击中两个角色。",
	"Hippo caste should keep their distance at all times, relying on Hydro Jet to deal damage. They are powerful healers and should focus their Waters-of-Life ability on allies suffering from debilitating conditions to get them back in the fight.

	"{@b Easier Tactics} - The simplest change to decrease the difficulty of the river-blessed is to avoid using their bonus abilities gained from Foundations of the Lesser. Don't have the feline caste disarm every turn, hold off on having the crocodile caste use {@spell wall of stone} for a round or two, and don't use the hippo caste's healing ability to remove spells like {@spell hold person}. Delaying Summon the Flood can make the fight easier, but it can also cause you to inadvertently set up a huge explosion of damage the party isn't ready for.": "{@b Easier Tactics}--降低受河水影响的人的难度的最简单的改变是避免使用他们从 \"小者之基 \"获得的奖励能力。不要让猫科动物种姓每回合都解除武装，推迟一两回合让鳄鱼种姓使用（%1%），不要使用河马种姓的治疗能力来消除（%2%）等法术。推迟召唤洪水可以使战斗变得更容易，但也可能导致你无意中设置了一个巨大的爆炸性伤害，而当事人还没有准备好。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - Pairing two river-blessed with allies who are skilled at keeping the party away from them is a deadly combo (ram-headed {@creature sun-cursed|TPK} work well for this). Having two of them is a dramatic increase in difficulty because it allows them to shield each other with Warding of the River, negating the most effective strategy of killing the healers first. Any other tweaks you make to keep the river-blessed alive longer—like favorable terrain that offers them cover or tight spaces so the party physically can't get close—further increases the difficulty of the encounter.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 将两个受河水影响的人与善于让对方远离他们的盟友配对，是一个致命的组合（公羊头{@creature sun-cursed|TPK}在这方面效果很好）。有两个这样的人，难度就会急剧增加，因为这可以让他们用守护之河互相掩护，否定了先杀治疗者的最有效策略。你为了让受河水影响的人活得更久而做的任何其他调整，比如为他们提供掩护的有利地形或狭小的空间，使党派的人无法靠近，都会进一步增加遭遇战的难度。",
	"Nartheneen cosmology emphasized the natural world as divine. Their \"deities\" included Waters-of-Life as a veneration of the necessity of water for existence. They saw it as a force for good, but one that could take life just as easily through drowning, flooding, or its absence in drought. Nartheneen uncommonly adept at channeling water were held in high regard, and from my own studies, only those of the so-called lesser castes were ever observed with such abilities. Furthermore, such Nartheneen lost these abilities if they attempted to carry them into a greater caste.

	"The term \"priest-king\" in the Nartheneen language was inaccurately translated by an early scholar who believed all rulers of Nartheneen society were male.

They seldom travel with other Nartheneen, for the risk of a disaster killing more than one is too terrible to consider, but they are often aware of the location of other nearby members of their species.

The only thing that can earn a sun-cursed's begrudging respect is power in all its forms, though they consider violence the most practical tool of authority.": "被太阳诅咒的人喜欢温暖、开阔的地方，没有什么阴凉。有些人爬上山，以便在云层之上；否则他们就居住在沙漠和广阔的平原上。他们大部分时间是隐居的，但最终不可避免地被驱使采取某种激烈的行动，这时他们进入社会，通常会造成很大的混乱。太阳诅咒者是纳特尼恩社会中的权威人物，他们把所有非纳特尼恩人当作奴隶。在与现代生物打交道时，太阳诅咒者是暴虐的、残忍的，不能把 \"低等生物 \"看作是可有可无的工具。唯一能赢得太阳诅咒者勉强尊重的东西是各种形式的权力，尽管他们认为暴力是最实用的权力工具。",
	"The third aspect of Nartheneen beliefe, Mother-Source, fell out of favor following the arrival of the Ebon Flame, a violent and corruptive deity. Some Nartheneen gave themselves completely over to this evil, surrendering body and soul in exchange for arcane power. Those who survived became ebon pyromancers, consumed completely by the whims and desires of their new master. No trace of their personality remains, and they exist only to destroy the enemies of the Nartheneen. Ebon pyromancers always have the head of a hawk, indicating their status as members of the Nartheneen elite.": "纳特尼恩信仰的第三个方面，即 \"母亲-源泉\"，在 \"伊本之火 \"到来之后就不受欢迎了，这是一个暴力和腐败的神。一些纳尔特尼恩人把自己完全交给了这个恶魔，用身体和灵魂来换取奥术力量。那些幸存下来的人成为了伊本火法师，完全被他们新主人的奇思妙想和欲望所吞噬。他们的个性没有留下任何痕迹，他们的存在只是为了消灭纳特尼恩的敌人。伊本火法师总是有一个鹰头，表明他们作为纳特尼恩精英成员的地位。",

	"The ebon pyromancer has a limited store of energy that it uses to empower its abilities—when it runs out, it becomes somewhat less dangerous.

A lack of agility is the closest thing they have to a weakness.": "伊本火法师有一个有限的能量储存，用来增强其能力--当它耗尽时，它的危险性就会降低。它对火和辐射效应完全免疫，对寒冷也有抵抗力。其他形式的伤害是完全有效的，尽管乌骨火法师既富有弹性又难以被击中。缺乏敏捷性是他们最接近弱点的东西。",
	"During an encounter, tracking the number of charges an ebon pyromancer has as well as the number of motes of netherplasm attached to each party member is crucial.

	"The ebon pyromancer's turn-by-turn tactics are fairly simple. Its goal is to end its turn within 10 feet of as many characters as possible to spread netherplasm via its Netherplasm Residue trait, and it should spend a charge to increase the radius if it can affect two or more additional characters by doing so. On its turn, target characters with no netherplasm with Cloying Death unless there are characters in melee, in which case you should make a single Necrotizing Fireclaw attack against them. Use All Shall Burn when available to block line of sight and force characters to move (ideally toward each other). If you're going to hit two or more characters when the flames detonate, spend a charge to maximize the damage.": "伊本火法师的回合战术相当简单。它的目标是在尽可能多的角色的10英尺范围内结束它的回合，以通过它的Netherplasm Residue特性来传播netherplasm，如果它可以通过这样做来影响两个或更多的角色，它应该花费一个冲锋来增加半径。在它的回合中，用 \"窒息之死 \"瞄准没有尼瑟斯姆的角色，除非有近战角色，在这种情况下，你应该对他们进行一次亡灵火爪攻击。在有条件的情况下使用 \"全部烧死 \"来阻挡视线并迫使角色移动（最好是朝向对方）。如果你要在火焰引爆时击中两个或更多的角色，请花费一次冲锋来最大化伤害。",
	"On turns when All Shall Burn is not available, use Spread the Plague to affect as many characters as possible. If the plague is spreading to two or more characters, spend a charge to double the amount of netherplasm the attaches to them. Netherplasm gets quite dangerous once characters have three or more motes attached, and you should let that persist for a round or two before using Violent Detonation to clear them out. Ideally you want to use Violent Detonation twice in the fight, one about halfway through and another shortly before the ebon pyromancer is deafeated.": "在All Shall Burn无法使用的回合，使用Spread the Plague来影响尽可能多的角色。如果瘟疫扩散到了两个或更多的角色，就花一个电荷将附着在他们身上的乙太之气增加一倍。一旦角色身上附着了三个或更多的微尘，尼瑟斯姆就会变得相当危险，你应该让它持续一两轮，然后用暴力引爆来清除它们。理想情况下，你要在战斗中使用两次暴力引爆，一次是在战斗进行到一半时，另一次是在黑火法师被干掉前不久。",

These fey prefer indirect dealings, observing their \"friends\" from afar and altering their fates on a whim. This habit comes not from malice, but from an obsessive and irresistible instinct. Compelling an ahd moar to behave in any manner contrary to this instinct is nearly impossible, as many who have sought eternal luck have learned to their great dismay.": "阿赫摩尔大部分时间都呆在精灵界，在荒野中游荡，喜欢扭转命运，把猎物变成猎物，反之亦然。当发现一个通往物质界（或其他任何地方）的入口时，它就会跳过去，渴望找到具有重大意义的时刻，它可以用好的或坏的命运影响。阿德摩尔通常是孤独的，因为很少有生物能容忍伴随着它们的突然逆转。这种厌恶并不能阻止Ahd moar寻找同伴，因为它还能对谁使用它改变命运的能力？这些妖怪喜欢间接的交易，从远处观察他们的 \"朋友\"，并随心所欲地改变他们的命运。这种习惯不是来自于恶意，而是来自于一种痴迷的、不可抗拒的本能。迫使阿特摩尔以任何方式违背这种本能的行为几乎是不可能的，正如许多寻求永恒的运气的人所了解的那样，他们非常沮丧。",
	"Time is a cruel master, and most consider its reign absolute. The most powerful spellcasters can barely imitate the most basic of a tasey-am's powers, which makes their efforts to stop time look like child's play. This fey leaps forward in time, storing temporal energy to unleash a flurry of activity even as it shunts its foes around the timeline and prevents them from attacking it. Simultaneous sightings of a tasey-am in different locations have led to a pair of competing theories: either this fey is not unique, or its control of time is so adept it can literally be in two places at once.": "时间是一个残酷的主人，大多数人认为它的统治是绝对的。最强大的施法者也只能勉强模仿塔西-阿姆最基本的力量，这使得他们停止时间的努力看起来像小孩子的游戏。这种妖怪在时间上跳跃，储存时间能量以释放出大量的活动，即使它在时间线上分流它的敌人并阻止他们攻击它。在不同的地方同时看到一个塔西-阿姆，导致了一对相互竞争的理论：要么这个费伊人不是唯一的，要么它对时间的控制是如此熟练，简直可以同时出现在两个地方。",
	"Though it is intelligent and wise, the tasey-am has never shown an interest in negotiation or diplomacy. It seldom speaks, and it acts with silent confidence.

Other beings are uneasy in its presence, as though it cannot—or should not—exist in a linear and logical world.": "虽然它很聪明，也很有智慧，但塔西阿姆从未表现出对谈判或外交的兴趣。它很少说话，而且以无声的自信行事。在任何环境下，Tasey-am的形态都让人感到不自然，它就像一块漏出神秘紫色气体的符石。其他生命在它面前感到不安，好像它不能或不应该存在于一个线性和逻辑的世界中。",
	"Tasey-am, the time-shaper. Not an official sobriquet, but one I'm fond of. I had the unique pleasure of a conversation with the tasey-am, during which it rejected 95 percent of my theories about temporal mechanics. The fact that 5 percent were judged accurate is a feat that would put me in history books, I should think, but that is not what this capter is about. I remain uncertain as to whether the tasey-am is a unique individual or one of an entire species. I have seen two in the same place, but even sharing a timeline with itself would not be the most impressive accomplishment I have seen the tasey-am perform. The creature has little taste for conversation, and my suggestion if you find yourself the subject of its attention is to prepare for battle or beat a hasty retreat. Perhaps both.": "Tasey-am，时间塑造者。这不是一个正式的称呼，但我很喜欢这个称呼。我曾有幸与Tasey-am对话，期间它拒绝了我95%的关于时间力学的理论。我想，5%的理论被认为是准确的，这是一个能让我载入史册的壮举，但这并不是这次谈话的主题。我仍然不确定Tasey-am是一个独特的个体还是整个物种中的一个。我曾在同一个地方看到过两个，但即使是与自己分享一条时间线，也不是我所看到的Tasey-am的最令人印象深刻的成就。这种生物对谈话没什么兴趣，如果你发现自己是它关注的对象，我的建议是准备战斗或匆忙撤退。也许两者都是。",

They can be found in the most inhospitable mountains or on remote islands, where their destructive power is of no consequence.

	"The feared aristocrats of the rakshasa, haddiyon have delved deeply into the evil origins of their kind. While the power they unearthed was formidable, the haddiyon paid a terrible price. The entire caste now overflows with a terrible corruption which they spread to all corners of the multiverse with the aid of profane magic. The face of a haddiyon is stripped of flesh, leaving only a skull whose eyes burn with purple flames. Their once magnificent fur is mangy and unkept, for the vile evil that suffuses a haddiyon cannot be contained without cost. Not quite undead, but not worthy of being called alive, these rakshasa are among the most fearsome fiends mortals can ever face.": "作为罗刹族中令人畏惧的贵族，哈迪雍深入研究了他们这种人的邪恶起源。虽然他们发掘出的力量是强大的，但哈迪雍付出了可怕的代价。整个种姓现在充斥着一种可怕的腐败，他们借助亵渎的魔法将其传播到多元宇宙的各个角落。哈迪恩人的脸被剥去了皮肉，只剩下一个头骨，眼睛里燃烧着紫色的火焰。他们曾经华丽的皮毛是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，因为弥漫在哈德迪昂身上的卑鄙邪恶不能不付出代价。这些罗刹并不是不死之身，但也不值得被称为活人，它们是凡人所能面对的最可怕的魔物之一。",

	"As with many spellcasting creatures, the danger posed by a haddiyon depends on which spells it casts. If given time to prepare for battle, the haddiyon casts {@spell foresight} for its universal benefits. When facing melee opponents, the rakshasa casts {@spell antilife shell} early. Otherwise it uses its concentration to focus on powerful damaging magic like {@spell bones of the earth|XGE} or {@spell whirlwind|XGE}. Additionally, consider {@spell freedom of movement} in advance of combat, thanks to its long duration and lack of required concentration. Note that most of the haddiyon's spells affect an area, which synergizes with its Blightcaller feature. This effect also applies to the haddiyon's Earth Reaver ability, which it can use to corrupt a massive area quickly.": "和许多施法的生物一样，哈德迪昂所带来的危险取决于它所施的法术。如果有时间准备战斗，哈德迪昂会施放（%0%）以获得其普遍的利益。当面对近战对手时，罗刹会提前施放（%1%）。否则，它将集中精力施展强大的伤害性魔法，如{@spell bones of the earth|XGE}或{@spell whirlwind|XGE}。此外，由于{@spell freedom of movement}持续时间长且不需要集中注意力，可以在战斗前考虑。需要注意的是，哈迪恩的大部分法术都会影响一个区域，这与它的Blightcaller特性有协同作用。这个效果也适用于哈德迪恩的 \"掘地魔 \"能力，它可以用这个能力迅速腐蚀一个巨大的区域。",
	"Don't be stingy with the haddiyon's spell slots in combat, particularly when facing spellcasting foes. With at least one spellcaster in the party, the fiend can leverage its natural magic absorption to regain spell slots.

	"Some incarnations of evil are so intolerable I can think of no productive reason for their continued existence. Such is the case with the rakshasa caste known as the haddiyon. These creatures have no respect for anything but their own ambition. I suspect even other rakshasa would rather be rid of them, though if such a thing were possible it would already have been done. Their corruption can taint even the purest of realms, reducing all it touches to a pathetic shell of its former glory. I will never forget the sensation...as if every fiber of my being was being violated by evil. At the risk of sounding too opinionated for professional publications, it is in this scholar's opinion that these creatures be opposed at all costs and destroyed without mercy.": "有些邪恶的化身是如此令人难以忍受，我想不出他们继续存在的有效理由。被称为 \"哈迪雍 \"的罗刹种姓就属于这种情况。这些生物除了他们自己的野心之外，对任何东西都不尊重。我怀疑即使是其他罗刹也宁愿摆脱他们，尽管如果这种事情是可能的，那就已经做了。他们的腐败甚至可以玷污最纯洁的领域，把它所接触到的一切都变成了以前辉煌的可怜的躯壳。我永远不会忘记这种感觉......仿佛我的每一根纤维都被邪恶所侵犯。冒着专业出版物听起来太有意见的风险，这位学者认为，应该不惜一切代价反对这些生物，并毫不留情地摧毁它们。",

Haddiyon are fascinated by evil and spend the majority of their existence seeking to understand its many facets. This knowledge contributes to their menace, as these rakshasa can be expected to know details about some of the most vile and comtemptable magic, artifacts, and acts that would turn a devil's stomach. Haddiyon are eager to experiment on other beings to test their theories. Each will collect a wide spectrum of creatures to ensure quality samples, though few beings serve a haddiyon willingly.

	"Celestial forces can embody abstract values; these beings shape sentient life in positive ways, furthering the cause of good throughout the realms. The greatest of these values are the seven virtues, principles that guide one's life irrevocably toward goodness. These holy aspects can assume physical form in the shape of bizarre celestials of polarizing morality. Each is extraordinarily powerful, tasked with bringing its unique aspect of goodness to the realms. Taken to extremes, these virtues can become restrictive, stifling, and even harmful. They manifest in areas that have strayed too far into vice and sin, and they seek to correct the problem through sweeping change. But the pendulum swings hard the other way, and to the mortal they \"help,\" the presence of a holy virtue can sometimes be worse than whatever evil came before.": "天体的力量可以体现出抽象的价值；这些生命以积极的方式塑造有生命的人，推动整个世界的善的事业。这些价值中最伟大的是七种美德，这些原则引导一个人的生活不可逆转地走向善。这些圣洁的方面可以以奇异的天体形态出现，具有极强的道德感。每个人都有超乎寻常的力量，负责将其独特的善的方面带到各个领域。如果走到极端，这些美德会成为限制性的、窒息性的，甚至是有害的。它们表现在那些已经偏离恶习和罪恶太远的领域，并试图通过全面的改变来纠正这个问题。但钟摆也会向另一个方向用力摆动，对他们 \"帮助 \"的凡人来说，神圣美德的存在有时会比之前的邪恶更糟糕。",

These are the most prolific and active, those most prone to taking physical form on the material plane. But there are four others. Balancing temperance, which restrains excesses of food and drink such that half the population of a town starves or dies of thirst. Unending patience, a long-running virtue that affects the subtlest changes and postpones events that are not yet ready to occur. Abounding charity, the scourge of the wealthy. Many a noble has lost their fortune to a sudden swell of altruism from an unknown source. And finally, loving kindness. Wars end when soldiers drop their arms and embrace as friends. Those same soldiers often turn on the leaders who sent them to battle, condemning them to the last with tears streaming down their cheeks.": "我在这本简编中详细介绍了三种圣德：（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。这些是最多产和最活跃的，是最容易在物质层面上形成实体的。但还有其他四种。平衡的节制，限制饮食的过量，以至于一个城镇的一半人口都饿死或渴死。无尽的忍耐，这是一种长期的美德，影响最微妙的变化，推迟尚未准备好的事件发生。丰富的慈善，是富人的祸害。许多贵族因为来自未知来源的突然涌现的利他主义而失去了财富。最后是仁爱之心。当士兵们放下武器，像朋友一样拥抱时，战争就结束了。这些士兵往往会背叛派他们上战场的领导人，谴责他们，让他们在最后时刻泪流满面。",
	"The least directly impactful of the holy virtues, sublime chastity debilitates its enemies and leaves them weak and ashamed. It also leaves them vulnerable to attack by other, more dangerous allies and is seldom found unsupported by other forces of good. Appearing as a gothic cathedral that walks like a man, these celestials are elegant testaments to the virtues of purity. The architecture of each chastity is unique, though all are mantled by three pairs of wings that allow it to move with a heavenly grace. A sublime chastity roots out corruption and decadence, forcefully correcting the course of moral impurity and cultural blight.": "崇高的贞操是最没有直接影响的圣德，它削弱了它的敌人，使他们变得软弱和羞愧。这也使他们容易受到其他更危险的盟友的攻击，很少发现他们没有得到其他善的力量的支持。这些天人以哥特式大教堂的形式出现，走起路来就像一个人，是纯洁美德的优雅见证。每个贞操的结构都是独一无二的，尽管所有的贞操都有三对翅膀，使其能够以天堂般的优雅姿态移动。崇高的贞洁能根除腐败和堕落，有力地纠正道德上的不纯和文化上的弊端。",
	"Sublime chastity is seldom considered a virtue in this day and age, but these celestials are nothing if not extreme. Personally, I would doubt anyone would extoll the benefits of complete and utter repression of our mortal nature—particularly when that someone is an amorphous ambulating energy field of divine magic—but that is merely my opinion. The sense of profound shame one feels in their presence is enough to turn a paladin's face bright crimson and make a rakish man into a priest. These may seem like positive changes, but the manner in which these changes are enforced is nothing less than violent.": "在这个时代，崇高的贞洁很少被认为是一种美德，但这些天人如果不极端的话，就没有什么。就个人而言，我怀疑是否有人会赞美完全彻底地压抑我们的凡人本性的好处--特别是当那个人是一个无定形的、伏在地上的神圣魔法能量场时--但这只是我的看法。一个人在他们面前感受到的深深的羞耻感足以让一个圣骑士的脸变得鲜红，让一个饶舌的人变成一个牧师。这些可能看起来是积极的变化，但这些变化的实施方式不亚于暴力。",

	"The chastity's action is much better spent casting {@spell heal} on an ally or using {@spell divine word} on a heavily wounded party to make a bad situation worse. Only use Faithful Strike if there are no good spellcasting options. Dedication can be used for a powerful roleplaying moment, with the chastity spending a turn preparing before casting {@spell geas} on one of the party members.

The longer the chastity gets ignored or defied, the stronger this critique becomes until finally the creature resorts to more forceful methods.": "崇高的贞洁在一个足够淫乱的社会行为导致它显现之前并不存在。一旦被创造出来，它就会在那个冒犯了它的天性的区域内和周围持续存在，直到它认为它得到了充分的救赎。在完成这一庄严的目的后，崇高的贞洁通常在一阵光芒中消失。然而，有些人还在徘徊，在这片土地上游荡，寻找更多需要纠正的罪过。与崇高的贞洁者的对话要么非常不舒服，要么完全没有意义。天人很少与他们认为足够纯洁的人交谈，认为这样做没有什么意义。对于那些贞操试图引导他们走向更有道德的生活的人，这个生物以一种实际和开放的方式进行了压倒性的批评。贞操被忽视或违抗的时间越长，这种批评就越强烈，直到最后该生物采取更有力的方法。",

	"The gracious humility is a powerful and mobile creature. It can fly at a good speed, but its real agility comes from its Teleport ability.

Remember, though, that it still has disadvanatege if attacking a target at range while another hostile creature is within 5 feet of it.": "每回合用神圣闪电进行四次攻击，除非有两个或更多的角色与谦逊者处于近战状态，这时你应该换成进行两次攻击并使用传送来摆脱伤害。在传送时，尽量到达距离多个角色30英尺以内的地方，以利用它所造成的破坏性闪光。由于神圣闪电可以作为近战攻击，谦逊者在攻击它旁边的生物时不会受到不利影响。不过请记住，如果在范围内攻击一个目标，而另一个敌对的生物在它的5英尺范围内，它仍然有不利因素。",
	"Save Pride Comes before the Fall for when the humility is low on hit points, ideally 100 or fewer. Lastly, don't forget its two important traits: Grace in Failure, which restores hit points on failed saving throws or when the humility suffers a critical hit, and Humble before Grace, which can knock characters {@condition prone} almost indefinitely and make it much harder for melee characters to get in range.": "在谦卑者命中率低的时候，最好是100或更少的时候，就把 \"骄傲来自于堕落 \"保存起来。最后，别忘了它的两个重要特征。失败中的恩典，在救赎失败或谦卑者遭受重创时恢复命中率；谦卑者先于恩典，几乎可以无限期地击倒角色（%0%），使近战角色更难进入攻击范围。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - Don't Teleport often, and when you do, try to arrive in a location that damages the fewest characters (or none) with its damaging flash. Spread the damage from Holy Lightning around, and avoid targeting characters who are low on hit points, because reducing them to 0 takes them out of the fight.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 不要经常传送，当你传送时，尽量到达一个能用其伤害性闪光损害最少的角色（或没有）的地方。将神圣闪电的伤害分散开来，并避免以低命中率的角色为目标，因为将他们的命中率降至0会使他们失去战斗力。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - Take advantage of the humility's fly speed to leverage its 120-foot range. Some of the most dangerous spells have a maximum range of 120 feet or less, and avoiding those leaves only ranged attackers (and warlocks with the Eldritch Spear invocation) as a serious threat. Save Pride Comes before the Fall for when the humility has 50 hit points or fewer, and hit someone who fails the saving throw with two shots of Holy Lightning to take the target out. For a really awful encounter, you can retreat after capturing a character, using Teleport to move 500 feet away every turn.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 利用谦逊者的飞行速度来利用其120英尺的范围。一些最危险的法术的最大射程为120英尺或更小，避开这些法术后，只有远程攻击者（和拥有长矛召唤的术士）才能构成严重威胁。将 \"骄傲来自于堕落 \"保存到谦卑者有50点或更少的命中率时，用两发 \"神圣闪电 \"击中救赎失败的人，从而将目标击倒。对于一个真正可怕的遭遇，你可以在捕获一个角色后撤退，每回合使用传送术移动500英尺远。",
	"A famous hero has been imprisoned by a gracious humility while in possession of an artifact required to prevent a coming calamity. The celestial refuses to release its prisoner and quickly flees from any conflict. An elite team is required to hunt down, capture, and maybe even slay the wondrous creature to prevent the coming catastrophe.": "一位著名的英雄在拥有防止即将到来的灾难所需的神器时，被一个亲切的谦卑所囚禁。该天体拒绝释放其俘虏，并迅速逃离任何冲突。一个精英团队需要追捕、捕获，甚至可能杀死这个神奇的生物，以防止即将到来的灾难。",
	"A gracious humility was summoned to aid in battle against a mighty evil dragon. While the forces of good were victorious, the humility accidentally knocked out and subsequently imprisoned the high cleric of a virtuous order who was participating in the battle. So far, the cleric has been unable to free herself, leading to an awkward standoff between the embarrassed celestial and a horde of angry followers.": "一个和蔼可亲的谦逊者被召唤来协助与一条强大的恶龙作战。虽然正义的力量取得了胜利，但谦卑者却意外地击倒了参与战斗的一个美德教团的高级教士，并随后将其监禁。到目前为止，这位教士一直无法解脱，导致这位尴尬的天人和一群愤怒的追随者之间出现尴尬的对峙。",
	"Immediately after the characters are triumphant over an extraordinarily difficult foe, a gracious humility appears and swiftly takes them all out. Its landscape is an idyllic farmland, which the party must cultivate and come to appreciate in order to satisfy the celestial enough to free them.": "在人物战胜了一个特别难缠的敌人之后，一个亲切的谦卑出现了，并迅速地把他们全部干掉。它的景观是一片田园牧歌式的农田，当事人必须培养和欣赏它，以满足天人的需要，使他们获得自由。",
	"Freedom is key to mortal happiness. We—and I say \"we\" in the broadest, cross-species sense of the world—value freedom above our lives. Countless historical examples point to revolutions and uprisings against overwhelming forces in pursuit of freedom. It is within this in mind that I say to you, gracious humility is the cruellest of all the heavenly virtues. A strange sentence for one not familiar with the virtues in their celestial manifestations, but I assure you it will make sense as you continue to read. A gracious humility entombs its foes in a microcosmic penitentiary that resembles a paradise. There they serve out a sentence that lasts until the creature is redeemed and properly humbled in the eyes of the holy virtue. Generally, this takes centuries, long enough that most of the victims perish of old age before achieving redemption.": "自由是凡人幸福的关键。我们--我说的 \"我们 \"是指世界上最广泛的、跨物种的意义--把自由看得高于我们的生命。无数的历史实例表明，革命和起义都是为了追求自由而对抗压倒性的力量。正是考虑到这一点，我对你们说，亲切的谦逊是所有天国美德中最残酷的。对于一个不熟悉天国美德表现的人来说，这是一个奇怪的句子，但我向你保证，当你继续阅读时，它就会有意义。和蔼可亲的谦卑把它的敌人困在一个类似于天堂的微观世界的监狱里。他们在那里服刑，直到生物得到救赎，在圣德的眼中得到适当的谦卑。一般来说，这需要几个世纪的时间，长到大多数受害者在获得救赎之前就已经老死了。",

	"Like all holy virtues, a gracious humility is an abstract idea until it manifests in response to egregious pride on the material plane. Once it forms, it centers itself in the area that caused its appearance and remains there until it is destroyed or called away by powerful magic. This can render a vast swath of land essentially uninhabitable, with only those utterly devoid of pride allowed to enter its domain unmolested. A gracious humility is inquisitive, appearing completely unthreatening until it decides those to whom it speaks needs a proper lesson. In combat the creature does not view its power as harmful, acting like a mother trying to give a difficult child a time-out.": "像所有神圣的美德一样，亲切的谦逊是一个抽象的概念，直到它在物质层面上对恶劣的傲慢做出反应时才会显现。一旦它形成，它就会把自己集中在导致它出现的区域，并留在那里，直到它被摧毁或被强大的魔法唤走。这可以使一大片土地基本上不适合居住，只有那些完全没有骄傲的人可以不受干扰地进入它的领域。和蔼可亲的谦逊是好奇的，看起来完全不具威胁性，直到它决定那些人需要一个适当的教训。在战斗中，这个生物不认为它的力量是有害的，就像一个母亲试图给一个难缠的孩子一个暂停的机会。",
	"The manifestation of an adamant diligence is an unmissable event. It appears as a heavenly storm, thick clouds dappled with radiant light. From within, a huge, shimmering orb projects blasts of devastating power over immense distances. The diligence sees all and tolerates no trespass. These creatures are snipers and assassins of the highest caliber, laying out even the most evasive enemies with unearthly precision. The appearance of an adamant diligence is a calamity of epic proportions, for few are virtuous enough to avoid its gaze.": "坚定的勤奋的表现是一个不可忽视的事件。它的出现就像一场天上的风暴，厚厚的云层上斑驳着光芒。从内部，一个巨大的、闪闪发光的球体将毁灭性的力量投射到遥远的地方。勤奋的人可以看到所有的东西，并且不能容忍任何的侵犯。这些生物是最高水准的狙击手和刺客，以超乎寻常的精确性消灭最善于躲避的敌人。坚定的勤奋者的出现是一场史诗般的灾难，因为很少有足够的美德来避免它的注视。",

It believes that conflict and fear fuel diligent action, and it hopes to be destroyed by those who survive its wrath.": "当凡人过于懒惰时，就会出现被称为 \"坚韧的勤奋 \"的圣德。它以光芒四射的云彩出现，在它的注视下对所有人造成破坏。它相信冲突和恐惧会助长勤奋的行动，它希望被那些在它的愤怒中幸存的人所摧毁。",
	"The adamant diligence has an incredible range; it is capable of firing precise bolts of energy at anything it can see. Its vision pierces illusory and magical concealment, and it can blast through even the most stalwart of magical barriers with minimal effort. Finally, it is surrounded by a thick cloud of swirling smoke that makes targeting the adamant diligence a challenge.": "坚韧的勤奋有一个令人难以置信的范围；它能够向它能看到的任何东西发射精确的能量弹。它的视野可以穿透虚幻和魔法的掩饰，它甚至可以用最小的力气轰破最坚固的魔法屏障。最后，它被一团厚厚的漩涡状烟雾所包围，使得瞄准坚韧的勤奋者成为一种挑战。",
	"The adamant diligence can shoot anything it can see and possesses {@sense truesight}, making invisibility and illusions useless. Large, physical obstructions that block its vision can work, though the adamant diligence will tear through them quickly. Teleporting into melee is the best option, as long as those engaging the diligence are capable of flight. Whenever the diligence uses an exceptionally powerful attack, that indicates it hasn't moved from its location, making it a somewhat easier target than usual.": "顽强的勤奋者可以射杀任何它能看到和拥有的东西（%0%），使隐身和幻觉失去作用。挡住它视线的大型物理障碍物也能起作用，不过坚韧的勤奋者会迅速撕开它们。只要那些与勤奋者交战的人能够飞行，传送到近战是最好的选择。每当勤奋者使用异常强大的攻击时，这表明它还没有离开它的位置，使它成为比平时更容易的目标。",
	"The watcher above, the falling sky, and many other names herald the arrival of an adamant diligence. Years ago, I watched Zau-Hek endure the wrath of the heavens, giving me an opportunity to work my magics.

	"As an artillery creature, the adamant diligence is most effective when it can remain safe from attack and spend turn after turn making attacks unhindered. Its Cloud Cover trait is important, requiring characters to guess its location within the cloud and imposing disadvantage on attacks. The diligence does not have to remain at the cloud's center and should be somewhat mobile. Alternate between using Heavenly Snipe without moving and maneuvering to keep the party guessing while making four Star Shot attacks.": "作为一种炮兵生物，当金刚勤奋者能够保持安全不受攻击，并在一个又一个回合中不受阻碍地进行攻击时，它是最有效的。它的云层特性很重要，要求角色猜测它在云层中的位置，并对攻击施加不利条件。勤奋者不一定要留在云的中心，应该有一定的机动性。在不动声色地使用天狙和机动地使用天狙之间交替进行，以使党派猜测，同时进行四次星际射击攻击。",
	"Dispersion is best used when the party manages to engage the diligence in melee with more than one character, or when they otherwise have a reliable way of targeting it, but it does prevent hte diligence from making any attacks that turn. Don't forget the Penetrating Shots feature—try to target any characters that are lined up perfectly with another to potentially land two (or more) hits. This, paired with Heavenly Snipe, is devastating. Using the adamant diligence with any allied creatures that can slow, restrain, or otherwise stop the party from engaging effectively makes the encounter downright lethal.": "分散是最好的方法，当党派设法用一个以上的角色与勤奋者近战时，或者当他们有一个可靠的方法来瞄准它时，但它确实阻止勤奋者在那一回合进行任何攻击。不要忘了穿透射击的功能--尝试瞄准任何与另一角色完美排列的角色，以便有可能打中两个（或更多）。这与 \"天堂之狙 \"搭配使用，具有破坏性。对任何能够减缓、限制或以其他方式阻止党派有效参与的盟友生物使用坚韧不拔的勤奋，会使遭遇战变得完全致命。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - Don't use Heavenly Snipe. If you rely on Star Shot, the adamant diligence will deal less damage, be more predictable, and be forced to remain within 500 feet of the party. Those changes alone make it much less of a threat.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 不要使用天罗地网。如果你依赖星辰射击，顽固的勤奋者会造成更少的伤害，更容易被预测，并被迫保持在党的500英尺之内。仅仅这些变化就使它的威胁大大降低。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - The human eye can see for many miles under ideal conditions, and it's fair to assume the adamant diligence possesses even more acute senses. With Heavenly Smite having unlimited range and the adamant diligence capable of flight, if you position it high up in the sky you can rain devastation down on the party unopposed. This is more of a puzzle than a fight, as the party will need to find a way to bridge the huge distance quickly before they can even start combatting the adamant diligence.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 在理想的条件下，人的眼睛可以看到很多英里的地方，可以说，坚韧的勤奋拥有更敏锐的感觉。由于天崩地裂具有无限的射程，而且金刚勤奋者能够飞行，如果你把它安置在高空，你就可以不顾一切地把破坏力降到对方身上。这与其说是一场战斗，不如说是一个谜题，因为在开始打击金刚勤奋者之前，他们需要找到一种方法来迅速弥补巨大的距离。",
	"An adamant diligence is predicted to appear above a bustling metropolis in seven days, seeking to ensure the prosperous people have not grown lazy in their success.

	"Unlike most other holy virtues, an adamant diligence expects to be defeated. It wants mortals to rise up and overcome it. Unfortunately, as it is one of the most powerful of the holy virtues this outcome seldom happens. More often, because the adamant diligence doesn't hold back, it eradicates all but the most innocent for miels around. Only the intervention of powerful heroes or even the gods themselves can take down an adamant diligence. Until then, the area around it becomes a wasteland devoid of all life. The creature is resolute in its belief that only merciless opposition can bring out the true character of heroes, and it can almost never be reasoned with. In the rare instance these creatures do speak, their voices boom like thunder, echoing for miles.": "与其他大多数神圣的美德不同，坚定的勤奋期望被打败。它希望凡人能够站起来，战胜它。不幸的是，由于它是圣德中最强大的一种，这种结果很少发生。更多的时候，因为坚韧不拔的勤奋不留情面，除了最无辜的人之外，它根除了周围所有的人。只有强大的英雄或甚至神灵本身的干预才能打倒金刚不坏之身。在那之前，它周围的地区会变成一片没有任何生命的荒地。这种生物坚定地认为只有无情的反对才能带出英雄的真正品格，而且几乎永远无法与之讲道理。在这些生物很少说话的情况下，它们的声音像雷声一样轰鸣，回荡在数英里之外。",

However, the death of the utterance is almost always enough to break the morale of any of its allies.": "设计带有诅咒之语的遭遇战有点棘手，因为它们几乎可以从任何形式的支持中受益。近战的战斗人员在恶魔般的实体将他们撕碎的同时，也让队伍保持忙碌。远程攻击者将他们的火力加入到地狱之语者已经令人印象深刻的远程炮击中，而额外的施法者可以支持咒语或进一步削弱队伍，所有这些都使一个已经很危险的敌人变得更加强大。然而，口述者的死亡几乎总是足以摧毁其任何盟友的士气。",
	"{@b Easier Tactics} - Be careful with using {@spell forcecage}. Against un unprepared party, it can knock a character (or two, or three) out of the fight for the entire battle. When conjuring fiends, cluster them together so they are easier to take out with a single, powerful spell. The utterance should start combat fairly close to the party, as once a barbarian or paladin is in melee it's not getting away.": "{@b Easier Tactics} - 使用{@spell forcecage}时要小心。在没有准备的情况下，它可以使一个角色（或两个，或三个）在整个战斗中失去战斗力。在召唤恶魔时，要把它们聚集在一起，这样它们就更容易被一个强大的法术干掉。咒语应该在离党派相当近的地方开始战斗，因为一旦野蛮人或帕拉丁进入近战，它就无法逃脱了。",
	"{@b Harder Tactics} - If the utterance starts the battle with {@spell foresight} cast on itself, all allied fiends have advantage on their attacks due to the Fiendish Slaves trait. This, of course, is in addition to the already substantial benefits of going into a fight with {@spell foresight}. Start the fight with {@spell mass suggestion} for a devastating opener (\"grovel for the next eight hours\" is an especially nasty request), and then use In Times of Need to get some damage dealers on the field.": "{@b Harder Tactics}--如果口述者在战斗开始时对自己施放了{@spell foresight}，由于恶魔奴隶的特性，所有同盟的恶魔在攻击上都有优势。当然，这是在以（%2%）进入战斗后已经获得的大量好处之外的。用{@spell mass suggestion}开始战斗，以获得一个毁灭性的开局（\"在接下来的八小时内卑躬屈膝 \"是一个特别讨厌的要求），然后用 \"需要时 \"在场上获得一些伤害处理者。",
	"Finally, as the entities persist for an hour, consider starting combat with a few of them already in existence. Manifesting them takes but a moment, so it is rare that an utterance would be without them. If you are feeling particularly cruel, use {@spell planar binding} to conjure even more powerful fiends to serve the utterance. However, such fiends should never be of a CR higher than the utterance.": "最后，由于实体持续了一个小时，可以考虑在已经存在的几个实体中开始战斗。召唤它们只需片刻，所以很少会出现没有它们的吭声。如果你觉得自己特别残忍，可以用{@spell planar binding}来变出更强大的恶魔来为口述者服务。然而，这样的恶魔的CR值绝对不能高于咒语。",

	"A helpless ally of the party suddenly gains a great power and bails them out of a difficult situation. The ally denies that they paid a high price for the power, but there may be unanticipated consequences for everyone involved—consequences of the hellish variety.": "党的一个无助的盟友突然获得了一种巨大的力量，并把他们从困境中拯救出来。该盟友否认他们为这股力量付出了高昂的代价，但可能会给每个人带来意想不到的后果--地狱式的后果。",
	"An opera singer loses his voice, and everyone assumes his career is over. A week later, he makes a miraculous recovery and his voice is stronger than ever—so strong he blows the roof off the theater.": "一位歌剧演员失去了他的声音，所有人都认为他的事业已经结束。一周后，他奇迹般地康复了，他的声音比以前更强壮了--强壮到把剧院的屋顶都炸开了。",
	"In the heart of each utterance of damnation burns a mote of pure hellfire that blazes even after death. It makes a potent source of heat, energy, and even food (for fiends). A mote of hellfire functions similarly to a torch, but the flame cannot be extinguished, destroyed, or suppressed by effects that would ordinarily affect fire. Only a {@spell dispel evil and good} spell is able to destroy a mote of hellfire permanently, and such motes are typically worth around 4,000 gp, assuming the right buyer can be found. Selling one is sure to attract unwholesome attention.": "在每一句诅咒的话语中，都燃烧着一粒纯粹的地狱之火，即使在死后也会燃烧。它是热量、能量、甚至食物（对于恶魔）的有力来源。地狱之火的功能与火炬相似，但火焰不能被熄灭、破坏，也不能被通常影响火的效果所压制。只有{@spell dispel evil and good}的法术能够永久地摧毁地狱之火的火种，这样的火种通常价值4000金币左右，前提是能找到合适的买家。卖掉一个肯定会引起不健康的注意。",
	"As expected, utterances of damnation travel in the company of fiends. Though they share much in common with demons, they tend toward devils as their companions as they're much easier to control and are more predictable. They may ally with other creatures for a time, if it suits them, but such alliances are always temporary and always end in a lot of hellfire, with a cackling utterance of damnation fleeing the scene as it burns to ashes behind it. To further their research of truespeech, an utterance of damnation must have a base of operation from which it can call forth more sources of knowledge. Because few civilized societies tolerate such activities, an utterance will renovate abandoned buildings or clear out dungeons to be more suitable to their needs. Such locations quickly become overrun with fiends, much to the detriment of those living nearby.": "正如预期的那样，诅咒的话语与恶魔相伴而行。虽然他们与恶魔有很多共同点，但他们倾向于将恶魔作为他们的伙伴，因为它们更容易控制，也更容易预测。如果适合他们，他们可能会与其他生物结成联盟，但这种联盟总是暂时的，而且总是以大量的地狱之火结束，当诅咒之语在身后烧成灰烬时，他们会咯咯笑着逃离现场。为了进一步研究真话，诅咒之语必须有一个运作基地，它可以从中召唤出更多的知识来源。因为很少有文明社会能容忍这样的活动，一个诅咒之语会翻新废弃的建筑或清理地牢，以更适合他们的需要。这样的地方很快就会被恶魔们占领，对附近的居民造成很大的伤害。",
	"Blood is the sweet nectar of life. It is fitting, then, that those who value power and control would jump at the chance to control the life-giving essence of blood with but a word.

With each syllable of truespeech they tinker with the essence of life, unnaturally enhancing their own existence and violating the forms of others. Like their compatriots, utterances of blood are deformed by their practices, sickly pale with oversized mouths, no eyes, and a four-foot tongue of crimson red. With the bedside manner of a professional doctor, an utterance of blood seeks out new biological samples to study.

	"The utterance of blood is a support creature. It is at its best when working in tandem with powerful monsters, especially those that thrive in melee combat and can keep pesky characters like barbarians and monks away from the utterance. In a fight, it should focus on spreading Blood Plague as quickly as possible, targeting those who rely on attack rolls but tend to have low Constitution saving throws, such as rangers, rogues, and warlocks. Then, if the utterance or any of its allies are suffering, it uses Life Transference to restore them. If no one is struggling, it uses Mirror Vitae on any threats it suspects are less wise than other enemies, like fighters and barbarians. Be generous with spending hit points (or temporary hit points), and rely on the damage taken by both the party and the utterance's allies to recharge its temporary hit points.

	"{@b Harder Tactics} - Half of making this fight harder is giving the utterance better backup. Strong melee monsters are great allies, and anything that can push characters around or give them disadvantage on Constitution saving throws will make it harder for the party to counteract the utterance's abilities. Additionally, anything that can cast {@spell silence} makes a potent ally to the utterance, because none of its abilities require speaking, and the spell will prevent the party from using healing abilities like {@spell lesser restoration} to neutralize Blood Plague. The other half is focusing on using Blood Plague and Mirror Vitae early to do a lot of damage to fragile but dangerous foes like monks, rogues, and wizards. Having an enemy in melee combat with an utterance of blood isn't that detrimental because none of its abilities require attack rolls.": "{@b Harder Tactics} - 让这场战斗变得更难的一半原因是给异口同声更好的支持。强壮的近战怪物是很好的盟友，任何能把角色推来推去或让他们在宪法规定的投掷中处于劣势的东西，都会让党派更难抵御言语的能力。此外，任何能够施放（%1%）的东西都会成为咒语的有力盟友，因为它的能力都不需要说话，而且这个咒语会阻止党派使用像（%2%）这样的治疗能力来中和血腥瘟疫。另一半是专注于早期使用血色瘟疫和镜像维塔，对僧侣、流氓和魔法师等脆弱但危险的敌人造成大量伤害。让敌人在近战中与血之吭声并不那么有害，因为它的能力都不需要攻击卷。",

In the past, this was hardly a matter of concern, for few could use enough magic to create more than a pinprick void in the weave. But in this age of arcane abundance, our over-reliance of spells is creating something dangerous—void pockets that do not shrink. Instead, they grow. They hunger. They think and scheme.
