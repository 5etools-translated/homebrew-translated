	"Imagine you have been running a game of 5th Edition for some time now, and the characters have passed the 10th level benchmark. As their powers increase, you find yourself struggling to field compelling foes that threaten these seemingly invincible heroes with defeat. As you scour the world in search of resources to improve your game's monsters, you find yourself spending more and more time customizing a handful of foes to meet your encounter needs. It's exhausting, time-consuming, and frustrating to see an ambush undone by a simple {@spell banishment} spell or to watch your dragon boss fight be butchered in a single turn by a paladin's critical. This pain has driven many an experienced DM to retire a campaign when it should be at its most exciting. Whether you are looking for a solution to these aforementioned problems or just need some deadly, high-level foes for your next game, the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} is here to inspire fear and shred character sheets, no matter the level of your players' characters.": "想象一下，你运行第五版游戏已经有一段时间了，而且角色已经超过了10级的基准。随着他们力量的增加，你发现自己正在努力寻找令人信服的敌人，来威胁这些看似无敌的英雄们的失败。当你在世界范围内寻找资源来改善游戏中的怪物时，你发现自己花了越来越多的时间来定制少数几个敌人以满足你的遭遇需求。看到埋伏被一个简单的{@spell banishment}法术破坏，或者看到你的龙族BOSS战在一个回合内被一个圣骑士的关键性攻击所屠戮，这是令人疲惫、耗时和沮丧的事情。这种痛苦促使许多有经验的DM在战役最精彩的时候退场。无论你是在寻找上述问题的解决方案，还是只是需要为你的下一个游戏寻找一些致命的高级敌人，(1%)都会在这里激发恐惧，粉碎角色表，无论你的玩家角色是什么级别。",
	"The creatures in this book will eat skilled adventurers for breakfast. Overconfident or careless characters will find themselves petrified by the song of a beautiful fey bird, slain instantly by an undead horseman heralding death, or the favorite chew toy of a ravenous brown dragon. These monsters will feel right at home in your game world, lurking in its darkest corners or conquering nations. Bizarre, mysterious, malevolent, or virtuous, these creatures are exclusively high-level threats suitable only for veteran heroes. Wherever these foes appear, they will make an impact, putting your players' skills to the test and contributing to a vibrant and dangerous campaign.": "本书中的生物会把熟练的冒险家当作早餐吃掉。过于自信或粗心的角色会发现自己被美丽的费伊鸟的歌声吓坏了，被预示死亡的不死骑士当场杀死，或者成为贪婪的棕龙最喜欢的咀嚼玩具。这些怪物会在你的游戏世界中感到宾至如归，潜伏在最黑暗的角落或征服国家。离奇的、神秘的、恶毒的或善良的，这些生物都是只适合老资格英雄的高级威胁。无论这些敌人出现在哪里，他们都会产生影响，使你的玩家的技能受到考验，并为一个充满活力和危险的活动作出贡献。",
	"The {@i Totally Party Kill Bestiary} contains many fantastic and wonderous creatures to delight your players. It also contains some pretty dark and gruesome critters that will do gnarly stuff to PCs who encounter them. We feel that such designs add an air of menace and danger that inspires real fear and disgust in players; emotions can be just as important to the RPG experience as fun, laughs, and thrills. However, that doesn't mean they are for everyone, and you should take the prospect of integrating creatures that push this boundary seriously. The last thing we want is to see someone walk away from your game table because of something we made, so please talk to your players about how far you can push violence against their characters using some of the monsters contained with these pages. You don't have to give everything away but do your best to ensure the people at your table don't get hurt.": "{@i Totally Party Kill Bestiary}包含了许多神奇的生物，可以让你的玩家感到高兴。它也包含一些相当黑暗和可怕的小动物，它们会对遇到它们的人做出可怕的事情。我们觉得这样的设计增加了一种威胁和危险的气氛，激发了玩家真正的恐惧和厌恶；情感对于RPG体验来说，与乐趣、笑声和惊险一样重要。然而，这并不意味着它们适合每个人，你应该认真对待整合推动这一界限的生物的前景。我们最不希望看到的是有人因为我们做的东西而离开你的游戏桌，所以请与你的玩家讨论，你可以在多大程度上使用这些页面所包含的一些怪物对他们的角色实施暴力。你不必把一切都说出来，但要尽力确保你桌上的人不会受到伤害。",

	"This book is more than just another appendix of monsters. It is a tactical assortment of brutally dangerous enemies organized into groups for optimal use by a DM. In addition to a group's combat statistics, also included are crucial tactical information to run challenging encounters, lore to seamlessly integrate these creatures into your game world, and other fun details that showcases monsters like never before. Almost every monster found within this book has a challenge rating of 10 or higher and is designed to withstand some of the greatest high-level character strengths. This is not another monster encyclopedia. This book's content is intended to be used in a way most appropriate for your game and empowers you to do so. Whether you need a villain to foreshadow a coming apocalypse or a devious threat that pushes players to their limits, this book provides you with both the statistics and the tools to make that possible.": "这本书不仅仅是另一个怪物的附录。它是一个由残酷危险的敌人组成的战术组合，将其编入DM的最佳使用范围。除了一个组的战斗统计数据外，还包括运行挑战性遭遇战的关键战术信息、将这些生物无缝融入你的游戏世界的传说，以及其他有趣的细节，以前所未有的方式展示了怪物。本书中发现的几乎每一种怪物都有10级或更高的挑战等级，并被设计用来承受一些最伟大的高级角色的力量。这不是另一本怪物百科全书。本书的内容旨在以最适合你的游戏的方式来使用，并赋予你这样做的权力。无论你是需要一个预示即将到来的天启的反派，还是需要一个将玩家推向极限的狡猾威胁，本书都为你提供了统计数据和工具，使之成为可能。",
	"Monsters within this book are compiled into thematic groups that share a background, lore, and ecology; imaginatively named \"monster groups.\" Each monster group section contains its members' combat classifications, favors and foils, which member possesses the fearsome \"TPK brand,\" lore, tactics, plot hooks, treasure, ecology, and special notes by iconic gnome bard, Talien Vos Karven. This section details the significance of each of those elements, which are critical for you to understand to achieve best results when designing encounters featuring said monsters.": "本书中的怪物被编入共享背景、传说和生态的主题组；富有想象力的命名为 \"怪物组\"。每个怪物组的部分都包含其成员的战斗分类、恩惠和衬托、哪个成员拥有可怕的 \"TPK品牌\"、传说、战术、情节钩子、宝藏、生态，以及标志性地精吟游诗人塔利安-沃斯-卡文的特别说明。本节详细介绍了这些元素的意义，这对你在设计以上述怪物为特色的遭遇战时达到最佳效果至关重要。",
	"Monsters within this book are classified into groups based on their strengths and abilities, which helps a DM easily understand their role on the battlefield. Each monster possesses a classification, with the most powerful among them being \"Elites\" who are proficient in multiple classifications simultaneously. By understanding this system of classifications, you can craft encounters that deliver on a specific challenge you want your players to experience. Do you want your heroes to dodge sniper fire as they storm a fortress? Use an artillery creature. Looking for a fearsome beast that crushes adventurers beneath its feet? Try a brute. Perhaps you need a final boss for your dungeon, in which case all you must do is find an appropriate elite. This system is a throwback to 4th Edition and helps create encounters that deliver on a specific style of play. The details of each monster classification and how to use them can be found in this section.": "本书中的怪物根据它们的实力和能力被分为不同的组别，这有助于DM轻松了解它们在战场上的作用。每个怪物都有一个分类，其中最强大的是 \"精英\"，他们同时精通多种分类。通过了解这个分类系统，你可以精心设计遭遇战，以实现你希望你的玩家体验的特定挑战。你想让你的英雄们在攻打要塞时躲避狙击手的射击吗？那就用一个炮兵生物吧。想找一个能把冒险者踩在脚下的可怕的野兽？试试蛮牛吧。也许你的地下城需要一个最后的老板，在这种情况下，你必须做的就是找到一个合适的精英。这个系统是第四版的翻版，有助于创造出能够实现特定游戏风格的遭遇战。每个怪物分类的细节以及如何使用它们可以在本节中找到。",
	"{@b Artillery.} The artillery classification indicates ranged combat specialists with abilities that can harry enemies from afar. Only the best snipers can match an artillery creature at ranged combat, which can often unleash firepower that puts even the most optimized {@spell eldritch blast}-slinging warlock to shame. Artillery creatures are vulnerable at close range, relying on allies or their own evasive abilities to stay out of melee. An artillery wants to end a fight from afar, keeping its enemies on the defensive and struggling to find cover.": "{@b Artillery.} 炮兵分类表示远程战斗专家，其能力可以从远处骚扰敌人。只有最好的狙击手才能在远程战斗中与火炮生物相提并论，它所释放的火力甚至能让最优化的{@spell eldritch blast}的术士感到羞愧。炮兵生物在近距离上很脆弱，依靠盟友或他们自己的闪避能力来远离近战。炮兵希望从远处结束战斗，让敌人处于防守状态并努力寻找掩护。",
	"{@b Brute.} Brutes are brutal melee combatants specializing in giving out as much punishment as they take. Free from player interference, a brute quickly pulverizes vulnerable characters and dismantles tactical advantages. Brutes can be counted on to take powerful hits and often do so to protect vulnerable allies or objectives. A brute seeks to be the focus of a fight, soaking up punishment and returning the favor tenfold.": "{@b Brute.}野蛮人是残酷的近战战士，专门给人以同样多的惩罚。在不受玩家干扰的情况下，野蛮人可以迅速粉碎脆弱的角色并摧毁战术优势。蛮牛可以依靠强大的攻击力，并经常这样做来保护脆弱的盟友或目标。蛮牛寻求成为战斗的焦点，吸收惩罚并十倍地回报。",
	"{@b Controller.} Controllers may not be the ones who kill a character, but they certainly make things easier for their allies. Controllers unleash debilitating effects that impair or cripple their enemies and are most effective when paired with more directly lethal creatures able to capitalize on advantages the controller provides. A controller wants to secure victory through tactical superiority, placing itself and its allies into a winning position, the tabletop equivalent of setting up a checkmate.": "{@b Controller.}控制者可能不是杀死一个角色的人，但他们肯定会让他们的盟友更轻松。控制者释放衰弱的效果，损害或削弱他们的敌人，当与能够利用控制者提供的优势的更直接致命的生物搭配时，控制者是最有效的。控制者希望通过战术优势来确保胜利，将自己和盟友置于胜利的位置，相当于在桌面上设置一个将棋。",
	"{@b Elite.} Elites are monsters with enough diverse strengths to fit multiple classifications. Only the most powerful of creatures are elites and possess few weaknesses that adventurers can exploit. As rare as they are powerful, elites can be considered bosses that lurk at the end of a dangerous dungeon or the climax of an epic adventure. An elite is often legendary and crushes opposition with overwhelming power.": "{@b Elite.} 精英是具有足够多的不同实力的怪物，适合多种分类。只有最强大的生物才是精英，并且拥有冒险者可以利用的少数弱点。精英既罕见又强大，可以被认为是潜伏在危险的地下城尽头或史诗般的冒险高潮中的老板。精英通常具有传奇色彩，以压倒性的力量粉碎对手。",
	"{@b Leader.} Leaders are masterful support creatures that aid allies with healing, magical enchantment, and other powerful buffs. Leaders rarely possess significant kill potential, focusing instead on teamwork and keeping their deadly allies in top fighting shape. Leaders need at least a few allies to help, preferring those that help them accomplish their encounter objectives. In combat, a leader alleviates harm on its allies, undoing damage with an efficiency that is nearly impossible to outclass.": "{@b Leader.} 领导者是一种高超的辅助生物，他们用治疗、魔法和其他强大的BUFF来帮助盟友。领导者很少拥有显著的杀伤力，而是专注于团队合作，使他们的致命盟友保持最佳战斗状态。领导者至少需要几个盟友的帮助，更喜欢那些帮助他们完成遭遇战目标的盟友。在战斗中，领导者会减轻对其盟友的伤害，以几乎不可能超越的效率消除伤害。",

I can see since you've purchased this tome that not only do you have impeccable literary taste but a hunger for knowledge that exceeds what most of the common folk would call \"reasonable.\" I am Talien Vos Karven, acclaimed ecologist from the College of Lore and master adventurer. It is with no small personal risk to myself and my companions that I have compiled an encyclopedia of what is, without a doubt, this world's most fearsome creatures.

While much of what you read here is objective fact, I have taken the liberty of adding my own brilliant suppositions, insights, and theories about many horrors I encountered. Should you have the misfortune of encountering one of these creatures, I hope that you survive to expand upon this knowledge. Our existence is a fragile thing, and I hope that through understanding these most dangerous forces, we can better protect that which matters most.": "欢迎你，亲爱的读者。既然你购买了这本小册子，我可以看出你不仅有无可挑剔的文学品味，而且对知识的渴望超过了大多数普通人所谓的 \"合理\"。我是塔利安-沃斯-卡文，来自传说学院的著名生态学家和冒险家大师。我冒着对自己和同伴不小的个人风险，编制了一本百科全书，毫无疑问，这是这个世界上最可怕的生物。在这本书中，你会发现我所发现的关于这些可怕敌人的所有信息，从可疑的传闻到我自己的第一手经验。虽然你在这里读到的大部分内容都是客观事实，但我还是冒昧地对我遇到的许多恐怖事件加入了我自己的精彩推测、见解和理论。如果你不幸遇到这些生物之一，我希望你能活下来，扩大这些知识。我们的存在是一个脆弱的东西，我希望通过了解这些最危险的力量，我们可以更好地保护最重要的东西。",
	"{@b Lurker.} Master ambushers and assassins, lurkers strike first and hard. Using evasion and stealth to achieve their goals, lurkers are slippery foes that are difficult to lock down and destroy. Because adventurers travel in groups, most lurkers require the assistance of other creatures to finish the job. A lurker seeks to systematically and swiftly eliminate threats, taking heroes out of commission before they have a chance to respond.": "{@b Lurker.}伏击者和刺客高手，潜伏者先下手为强。潜伏者利用躲避和隐身来实现他们的目标，他们是难以锁定和消灭的狡猾敌人。由于冒险者是成群结队的，大多数潜伏者需要其他生物的协助才能完成任务。潜伏者试图系统地、迅速地消除威胁，在英雄们有机会作出反应之前就使他们失去行动能力。",
	"{@b Skirmisher.} Mobility specialists, skirmishers use hit-and-run tactics to deliver precise blows while avoiding reprisal. A skirmisher can swiftly capitalize on a vulnerable enemy or disrupt a tactical advantage. Clever skirmishers are good at teamwork, waiting for the precise moment to strike or baiting frustrated adventurers into chasing them into traps. A skirmisher wants to frustrate and harass its target, too dangerous to ignore but too elusive to easily kill.": "{@b Skirmisher.}机动性专家，小兵使用打了就跑的战术，在避免报复的同时给予精确的打击。小兵可以迅速地利用脆弱的敌人或破坏战术优势。聪明的小兵善于团队合作，等待准确的时机进行打击，或者诱使沮丧的冒险者追赶他们进入陷阱。一个小兵想要挫败和骚扰它的目标，太危险而无法忽视，但又太难以捉摸而无法轻易杀死。",
	"{@b Soldier.} Tactical melee combatants of the highest caliber, a creature with the soldier classification is an implacable barrier that cannot be overcome with brute force. These creatures often plant themselves firmly between any force seeking to assail weaker allies, punishing those who injure their comrades with a frightful vengeance. A soldier never fights alone and wants to enable and protect its more vulnerable allies to achieve victory.": "{@b Soldier.}最高水平的战术性近战战斗人员，士兵分类的生物是一个不可逾越的障碍，不能用蛮力克服。这些生物经常在任何试图攻击弱小盟友的力量之间牢牢地安插自己，以可怕的复仇之心惩罚那些伤害其同伴的人。士兵从不孤军奋战，希望能使其更脆弱的盟友获得胜利，并保护他们。",
	"An understanding of a creature's strengths and weaknesses is essential to a succesful encounter. Along with a monster's classification will be a short list of character abilities and features that favor or foil the monster's own abilities and features. Use this information to ensure your encounters challenge the players in the right ways, giving them a specific path to victory. Some mosnters favor no features, meaning there are no optimal paths to succeed against it.": "对生物的长处和弱点的理解对于成功的遭遇战是至关重要的。伴随着怪物的分类，会有一个简短的角色能力和特征清单，这些能力和特征有利于或挫败怪物自身的能力和特征。利用这些信息来确保你的遭遇战以正确的方式挑战玩家，给他们提供一条通往胜利的具体道路。有些怪物不喜欢任何特征，这意味着没有最佳的路径可以成功地对付它。",

	"{@b Foils.} Which character features, classes and abilities perform poorly against the monster.": "{@b Foils.} 哪些角色特征、等级和能力在面对怪物时表现不佳。",
	"The {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} features a number of creatures with a unique set of traits, summarized by classifying it as a titanic creature. A titanic creature is truly massive - with a unique anatomy that doesn't make sense for it to be treated as a single target. It has multiple sections, each of which functions like an independent creature, relying on the monster's core statistics for most of its effects. Each section has the same AC, resistances, immunities, and saving throw bonuses as the base statistical block of the creature. Sections are affected by conditions and other effects individually, unless explicity stated otherwise in the section's traits. A titanic creature's statistics describe how much space the creature takes up along with each of its sections, as well as its height. If you're using physical miniatures, you're unlikely to have a massive miniature that's appropriate, so you have may to improvise something. Because a titanic creature is so big, creatures smaller than it can always occupy the same space, or move through the titanic creature's space without penalty, and titanic creatures neither take nor provoke opportunity attacks.": "{@i Total Party Kill Bestiary}的特点是一些具有独特特征的生物，总结起来就是将其归类为泰坦生物。泰坦尼克号生物是真正巨大的--具有独特的解剖结构，将其作为单一目标处理是没有意义的。它有多个部分，每个部分的功能都像一个独立的生物，依靠怪物的核心统计数据来实现其大部分效果。每个部分都有与该生物的基本统计块相同的攻击力、抵抗力、免疫力和蓄力奖励。各个部分都受到条件和其他效果的影响，除非在部分特征中另有明确说明。一个泰坦尼克号生物的统计资料描述了该生物在其每个部分所占的空间，以及它的高度。如果你使用的是实物缩影，你不可能有一个合适的巨型缩影，所以你可能要即兴创作一些东西。由于泰坦尼克号生物是如此之大，比它小的生物总是可以占据相同的空间，或者在泰坦尼克号生物的空间内移动而不受到惩罚，而且泰坦尼克号生物既不采取也不挑起机会攻击。",
	"Every titanic creature has a core section. If the \"core\" section is reduced to zero hit points, the titanic creature is slain. Other sections that are reduced to zero hit points become {@condition incapacitated} for as long as it has zero hit points, but the creature as a whole remains alive and well. Some creatures can restore {@condition incapacitated} sections during a fight while other's cant. In general, unless a titanic creature has an ability that allows it to restore an {@condition incapacitated} section, it can only do so if it finishes a long rest, which allows each section to individually spend Hit Dice to recover hit points.": "每个泰坦尼克号生物都有一个核心部分。如果 \"核心 \"部分的命中率降至零，泰坦尼克号生物就会被杀死。只要它的命中率为零，其他部分就会变成{@condition incapacitated}，但生物作为一个整体仍然活着，而且很好。有些生物可以在战斗中恢复（%1%）的部分，而其他生物则不能。一般来说，除非泰坦生物有能力让它恢复{@condition incapacitated}的部分，否则它只能在完成长时间的休息后才能这样做，这样可以让每个部分单独花费命中率来恢复命中率。",
	"In combat, every section has a fixed initiative result that it acts on. On each section's turn, if that section has a speed, the entire creature can move during that section's turn, following normal rules for movement. In some cases, a creature may have a certain speed on a specific section's turn, such as a dragon with a \"wings\" section only having a fly speed when its \"wings\" act.": "在战斗中，每个部分都有一个固定的主动权结果，它根据这个结果行动。在每个部分的回合中，如果该部分有一个速度，整个生物在该部分的回合中可以按照正常的移动规则进行移动。在某些情况下，一个生物可能在某个特定部分的回合中拥有一定的速度，例如一条拥有 \"翅膀 \"部分的龙只有在其 \"翅膀 \"行动时才有飞行速度。",
	"Characters can attempt to climb a Titanic creature as part of their movement by making an {@skill Athletics} or {@skill Acrobatics} check (their choice) opposed by the creature's {@skill Athletics} or {@skill Acrobatics} check (DM's choice). Success means they can move up to half their speed along the creature, failure means they stay where they are, whether that's on the ground or upon the creature. Making this attempt doesn't require an action, but a creature can only attempt it once per turn. If a creature takes damage while climbing a titanic creature or a forced movement effect would push or pull them while climbing, they must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (their choice) against a DC of half the damage taken or 10, whichever is higher. Success means they hold on, remaining where they are. Failure means they fall, dropping to the ground in the titanic creature's space and taking falling damage as appropriate. Titanic creatures have disadvantage on all attacks against creatures that are currently climbing them.": "角色可以尝试爬上泰坦尼克号生物作为他们运动的一部分，方法是做一个{@skill Athletics}或{@skill Acrobatics}的检查（他们自己选择），与该生物的{@skill Athletics}或{@skill Acrobatics}检查相对立（DM选择）。成功意味着他们可以沿着该生物移动到他们速度的一半，失败意味着他们留在原地，无论是在地上还是在该生物身上。做这个尝试不需要行动，但一个生物每回合只能尝试一次。如果一个生物在攀爬泰坦尼克号时受到伤害，或者强制移动效果会在攀爬时推拉他们，他们必须做一个力量或灵巧的拯救动作（他们自己选择），其DC为所受伤害的一半或10，以高者为准。成功意味着他们坚持住了，留在原地。失败意味着他们坠落，在泰坦尼克号生物的空间里掉到地上，并受到相应的坠落伤害。泰坦尼克号生物在对目前正在攀爬它们的生物的所有攻击中都处于劣势。",
	"You should use your best judgement when it comes to targeting a creature's sections. Ranged attacks should be able to target any section if the caster is within range of the creature, but melee attacks and touch spells can only target sections the character should conceivably reach. A fighter with a sword, for example, isn't going to be able to attack the head of a 60-foot tall golem, he'll be stuck hacking at the legs.": "当涉及到瞄准一个生物的部分时，你应该使用你最好的判断力。如果施法者在生物的范围内，远程攻击应该能够瞄准任何部分，但近战攻击和触摸法术只能瞄准角色可以想象得到的部分。例如，一个拿着剑的战士不可能攻击一个60英尺高的石像的头部，他只能砍腿。",
	"Likewise, use your best judgment when it comes to applying a status effects to the titanic creature. Casting {@spell dominate monster} on a dragon's tail, for example, probably won't work. It would need to target the creature's head or its core to be effective. Likewise, you probably can't knock a golem's arm {@condition prone}. Otherwise, most effects will only affect one section of the creature. For example, you could stun a creature's arms or legs, preventing them from acting, but the rest of the creature would act as normal. Finally, most titanic creatures are immune to forced movement and teleportation effects unless they wish to be affected.": "同样地，在对泰坦尼克号生物施加状态效果时，请使用你最好的判断。例如，对龙的尾巴施放（%0%），可能不会起作用。它需要以生物的头部或核心为目标才有效。同样地，你可能也不能敲打巨魔的手臂（1%）。否则，大多数效果只能影响生物的一个部分。例如，你可以击晕一个生物的胳膊或腿，使其无法行动，但生物的其他部分会正常行动。最后，大多数泰坦尼克号生物对强制移动和传送效果是免疫的，除非它们希望被影响。",
	"To avoid making dozens of rules to cover every possibility, control of the details is in your hands. Go with what feels right from the descriptions provided above and your own sense of fair play.": "为了避免制定几十条规则来涵盖各种可能性，细节的控制权在你手中。根据上面提供的描述和你自己的公平竞争意识，选择感觉正确的方法。",
	"With a book full of deadly, high-level monsters, it is difficult to imagine there are even more lethal threats. Unfortunately for would-be heroes, a majority of monster groups within this tome have a single member that is marked with a special skull emblem, declaring it a lethal threat. These monsters are certified party-killers, guaranteed to deliver the toughest fight possible for their challenge rating. Each branded creature possesses abilities that when applied by a skilled DM make for an extraordinarily dangerous encounter. Such creatures should never be used lightly and only if you are absolutely certain your players can handle being wiped out. These creatuers do not fight fair. Their abilities are devastating and overwhelming when used correctly, not only to adventurers but to the world around them. Consider carefully the consequences to both your narrative and gameplay when implementing such a foe.": "在一本充满致命的高级怪物的书中，很难想象还有更多的致命威胁。不幸的是，这本书中的大多数怪物群体都有一个特殊的骷髅头标志，宣布其为致命的威胁。这些怪物都是经过认证的派对杀手，保证能在其挑战等级中提供最艰难的战斗。每种烙印生物都拥有一些能力，当熟练的DM应用这些能力时，就会产生异常危险的遭遇。这种生物绝对不能随便使用，而且只有在你绝对确定你的玩家可以承受被消灭的情况下才可以使用。这些生物不会公平战斗。如果使用得当，它们的能力是毁灭性的，不仅对冒险者，而且对它们周围的世界都是压倒性的。在实施这样的敌人时，要仔细考虑对你的叙述和游戏的后果。",
	"Many of the creatures presented in this book have a statement by the gnome bard Talien Vos Karven, sharing his personal experiences with the monster, along with the occasional insight from his adventuring companions.

	"While every monster in this book is presented with the usual array of information about its background and features, information that a DM can make available to players is also included. When your players want to research a foe before facing it in battle, you can allow them to attempt certain group ability checks to gain valuable lore that will improve their odds of success against it. Groups wishing to attempt such checks should make significant efforts to even attempt the roll—gathering evidence, tracking movements, consulting wise beings, or delving through forgotten tomes. Once the party has done so, they may attempt a group ability check as detailed in the monster's lore section. Depending on the result, the party gains valuable information about the monster's behavior and abilities, examples of which are found in each monster's lore table. You should alter this section and the lore therein at your discretion to better fit your game world. Unless the characters are extremely powerful, give them a chance to gain lore about creatures found in this book. It can make for a meaningful downtime activity between adventurers, and odds are it won't spoil the encounter. If they choose to pass on the opportunity, the players have no one to blame but themselves when your monster lays them out.": "虽然本书中的每个怪物都有关于其背景和特征的常规信息，但也包括了DM可以提供给玩家的信息。当你的玩家想在战斗前研究一个敌人时，你可以让他们尝试某些团体能力检查，以获得有价值的传说，从而提高他们对抗敌人的成功率。希望尝试这种检查的团体应该做出重大努力，甚至尝试滚动--收集证据、追踪行动、咨询智者，或者钻研被遗忘的书本。一旦队伍完成了这些工作，他们就可以尝试进行团体能力检查，详情见怪物的传说部分。根据结果，党派会获得关于怪物的行为和能力的有价值的信息，这些例子可以在每个怪物的传说表中找到。你应该酌情改变这一部分和其中的传说，以更好地适应你的游戏世界。除非角色非常强大，否则要让他们有机会获得关于本书中的生物的传说。这可以使冒险者之间的休息时间变得有意义，而且有可能不会破坏遭遇战。如果他们选择放弃这个机会，那么当你的怪物把他们干掉的时候，玩家就只能怪自己了。",
	"Monsters with a high challenge rating are far more complicated than their low-class comrades. This makes the DM's job harder, so it is essential to combat the ever-expanding powers characters attain at high levels. To mitigate the challenges of running encounters featuring complex creatures, each monster has a tactics section with recommended average, easier, and harder tactics. Use these suggestions to cut down on preparation time and as a reference when you aren't sure what your monster should do. No matter what your players' skill level, this section will help you craft a finely tuned encounter of any desired difficulty.": "具有高挑战等级的怪物要比它们的低级同伴复杂得多。这使得DM的工作更加困难，所以必须对抗角色在高等级时获得的不断扩大的力量。为了减轻以复杂生物为特征的遭遇战的挑战，每种怪物都有一个战术部分，其中包括推荐的平均、较容易和较难的战术。使用这些建议可以减少准备时间，并在你不确定你的怪物应该做什么时作为参考。无论玩家的技能水平如何，这一部分都能帮助你制作出任何所需难度的精巧的遭遇战。",
	"When you find a monster you'd like to include in your game, this section provides you with fantasy scenarios to make it a part of your game world. These hooks can be small story elements to put your creature on the map or important plot threads that tempt players into going on a monster hunt that spans a dozen sessions.": "当你发现一个你想在游戏中加入的怪物时，本节为你提供了幻想方案，使它成为你游戏世界的一部分。这些钩子可以是小的故事元素，让你的生物出现在地图上，也可以是重要的情节线索，引诱玩家去进行跨越十几个时段的怪物狩猎。",
	"A hard-won victory deserves a suitable reward, and many of the creatures in the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} possess valuable equipment or are made of rare components that can be forged into useful items. When a monster has a treasure section, it is still at your discretion what the characters receive as a reward after defeating the monster. However, it is recommended you grant these rewards for particularly demanding encounters. On top of making victory taste all the sweeter, such treasures serve as trophies to remind players about their past conflicts and make for a good story to tell at the local tavern.": "来之不易的胜利应该得到适当的奖励，{@i Total Party Kill Bestiary}中的许多生物都拥有宝贵的装备，或者由稀有的成分制成，可以锻造成有用的物品。当一个怪物有一个宝藏部分时，仍然由你决定角色在击败怪物后获得什么奖励。然而，建议你对特别苛刻的遭遇给予这些奖励。除了让胜利的滋味更加甜美之外，这些宝物还可以作为战利品，提醒玩家他们过去的冲突，并在当地的酒馆里讲一个好故事。",
	"Even the most fiendish of monsters have a home, and their ecology section details where they prefer to live, explore, and hunt. Use a creature's ecology when considering its role in your game world. While you can certainly plop any monster into a dungeon without context, creatures of power have a difficult time existing without making some impact on the world around them. By letting your creatures have something to do in their free time, you can foreshadow an encounter or motivate players to act against it.": "即使是最凶残的怪物也有一个家，它们的生态部分详细说明了它们喜欢在哪里生活、探索和狩猎。在考虑一个生物在你的游戏世界中的作用时，要使用它的生态环境。虽然你可以在没有背景的情况下把任何怪物塞进地牢，但有能力的生物如果不对它们周围的世界产生一些影响，就很难存在。通过让你的生物在它们的空闲时间做些什么，你可以预示一个遭遇，或者激励玩家对它采取行动。",
	"Whether they be obnoxious or do-gooders spreading virtue about your grimdark game world or self-serving murderers smashing your intricate narratives to pieces, eventually characters need a good old fashion beat down. To suffer defeat is a meaningful RPG experience, and to snatch victory from the jaws of failure is always a campaign highlight. While the \"TPK\" in the book's title need not be taken literally, every game needs a few moments when the players wonder, {@i Is this the end?}": "无论他们是令人厌恶的好人，还是在你灰暗的游戏世界中传播美德的人，或者是自以为是的杀人犯，将你错综复杂的叙事打成碎片，最终角色都需要一个好的老式的打倒。遭受失败是一种有意义的RPG体验，而从失败中抢夺胜利总是一个活动的亮点。虽然书名中的 \"TPK \"不需要从字面上理解，但每个游戏都需要有几个时刻让玩家想知道，{@i Is this the end?}",
	"To make best use of this book and its monsters, you will need the 5th Edition core rules on hand to construct encounters. Your skills as a DM will come into play while implementing this content into your world. While it's tempting to completely wreck your players with an impossibly powerful creature, the goal of the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} is to put the most powerful characters in 5th Edition through fights that challenge and excite them. You should familiarize yourself with the general rules of encounter building, particularly those concerning combat encounter difficulty.": "为了更好地利用本书及其中的怪物，你需要手头的第五版核心规则来构建遭遇战。在将这些内容落实到你的世界中时，你作为DM的技能将发挥作用。虽然用一种不可能的强大生物完全摧毁你的玩家是很诱人的，但（%0%）的目标是让第五版中最强大的角色经历挑战和兴奋的战斗。你应该熟悉建立奇遇的一般规则，特别是那些关于战斗奇遇的难度。",
	"Because these montsers are organized into groups, where there is one, there are often more. Running a monster from this book can be the characters' first introduction to what becomes an entire family of lethal beasts, making them ideal for recurring enemies that continually raise the difficulty bar. Most of the time, characters can observe and interact with monster groups without fighting. These monsters can be more than deadly threats that lurk in a dungeon. They can tell a story, facilitate world building, and provide character niches that intrigue and disgust your players.": "因为这些怪物被组织成群，有一个，往往就有更多。从这本书中运行一个怪物可能是人物对成为整个致命野兽家族的第一次介绍，使他们成为不断提高难度的反复出现的敌人的理想选择。大多数时候，人物可以观察并与怪物群互动，而不需要战斗。这些怪物可能不仅仅是潜伏在地牢中的致命威胁。它们可以讲述一个故事，促进世界的建设，并提供角色的壁龛，使你的玩家感到好奇和厌恶。",
	"Every monster in 5th Edition has a challenge rating that indicates what its difficulty should be relative to characters of a certain level, and the ones found here are no different. Using challenge rating appropriately with these creatures can result in easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters according to the general rules of encounter building. This section talks about using the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} and the 5th Edition rules for determining challenge rating to create a quality high-level experience you can find nowhere else.": "第五版中的每一种怪物都有一个挑战等级，表明相对于某一等级的角色而言，其难度应该是多少，这里的怪物也不例外。根据建立奇遇的一般规则，对这些生物适当地使用挑战等级可以产生简单、中等、困难和致命的奇遇。本节讲述了如何使用（%0%）和第五版确定挑战等级的规则来创造你在其他地方找不到的优质高级体验。",
	"With high-level play in 5th Edition comes big numbers. As a creature's chance to hit, save DCs, AC, and other features improve, so too do its odds of success in its endeavors or chance of foiling its attackers. Where the d20 eas once the biggest factor in determining success at lower levels, at high levels a creatures' (or character's) significant bonuses to their advantages weigh more heavily. A creature with a +20 to hit is probably going to land most of its attacks regardless of its d20 rolls, and its damage rolls are going to be more consistent with a +10 bonus from its Strength. With the exception of the natural 1 and natural 20, this means you can expect a more average result from creatures in your encounters with fewer twists from wacky rolls. Beware! This consistency also applies to your encounter's weaknesses. Having no bonuses to an Intelligence saving throw means your creature has almost no chance of beating a DC 19 saving throw versus a {@spell feeblemind} spell. While this truth requires more forethought when building your encounters, it also makes predicting encounter outcomes and dynamics a lot easier. Use this to your advantage to deliver on more precise results and encounter goals!": "在第五版中，高水平的游戏伴随着大量的数字。随着一个生物的命中率、救赎DCs、AC和其他特征的提高，它的成功几率和挫败攻击者的机会也随之提高。在低级别的情况下，D20曾经是决定成功与否的最大因素，而在高级别的情况下，生物（或角色）对其优势的重大奖励就显得更为重要了。一个拥有+20命中率的生物可能会使它的大部分攻击落地，而不考虑它的d20卷，它的伤害卷会与它的力量的+10奖励更加一致。除了自然的1和自然的20之外，这意味着你可以期望在你的遭遇中从生物那里得到一个更平均的结果，而从古怪的滚动中得到更少的扭曲。请注意! 这种一致性也适用于你的遭遇战的弱点。对智力救赎没有奖励意味着你的生物几乎没有机会战胜DC19对{@spell feeblemind}法术的救赎。虽然这个事实要求你在构建奇遇时要有更多的预想，但它也使得预测奇遇的结果和动态变得更加容易。利用这一点来实现你的优势，以达到更精确的结果和遭遇战的目标。",
	"To a group of adventurers, death at 1st level is a catastrophe, at 6th level a significant inconvenience, at 10th level a pit stop, and at 15th level a speedbump. When you are dealing with characters who can exile their foes to other planes, {@spell wish} reality into new forms, or enslave a small army of minions, providing a challenge means thinking about the game differently. While your encounter might technically be \"deadly,\" killing a 16th-level fighter doesn't mean much when his cleric friend burns a single 3rd-level spell slot to cast {@spell revivify}. When thinking abount encounter difficulty for characters of 10th level or higher, we recommend changing the goals of encounters to reflect the following instead of their traditional explanations. When using monsters from the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} with encounter-building tools, these are the intended difficulty results. When using monsters from other resources, you probably have to assume the challenge ratings provided are actually lower than what they need to be to achieve these kinds of encounter results.": "对于一群冒险家来说，1级的死亡是一场灾难，6级的死亡是一个重大的不便，10级的死亡是一个坑，15级的死亡是一个减速带。当你面对的角色可以将他们的敌人流放到其他位面，{@spell wish}现实变成新的形式，或者奴役一小群小兵的时候，提供挑战意味着对游戏的思考方式不同。虽然你的遭遇在技术上可能是 \"致命的\"，但当一个16级的战士的牧师朋友用一个3级的法术槽来施放（%1%）时，杀死他并不意味着什么。在考虑10级以上角色的遭遇战难度时，我们建议改变遭遇战的目标，以反映以下情况，而不是其传统解释。当使用来自{@i Total Party Kill Bestiary}与奇遇构建工具的怪物时，这些是预期的难度结果。当使用来自其他资源的怪物时，你可能不得不假设所提供的挑战等级实际上低于实现这类遭遇战结果所需的等级。",
	"An easy encounter requires almost no effort to overcome. High-level characters will blaze through these encounters quickly and efficiently (sometimes with a single spell cast), making them better suited for storytelling tools than actual challenges. High level heroes have better things to do than battle weak foes that do not test their abilities. A party can handle an a near unlimited number of these encounters in an adventuring day.": "一个简单的遭遇几乎不需要付出任何努力就能克服。高级别的角色会快速有效地通过这些遭遇（有时只需施放一个法术），使它们更适合作为讲故事的工具而不是实际的挑战。高级别的英雄有更好的事情要做，而不是与不考验他们能力的弱小敌人作战。在一个冒险日中，一个团队可以处理几乎无限数量的这种遭遇。",
	"A medium encounter should be dangerous to any party that does not take it seriously. Player arrogance, laziness, or ignorance should cost the party significant resources, while a well-prepared and focused group should not be in mortal danger unless they get supremely unlucky. A party can handle between four to five of these encounters in a single adventuring day.": "对于任何不认真对待的队伍来说，中等规模的遭遇战应该是危险的。玩家的傲慢、懒惰或无知应该使队伍失去大量的资源，而一个准备充分、注意力集中的队伍应该不会有致命的危险，除非他们运气极差。一个团队在一个冒险日里可以处理四到五个这样的遭遇。",
	"A hard encounter is a brutal experience. If a party goes in unprepared, they will suffer dire consequences: deaths, massive resource expenditures, and negative impacts to the story. Even a party fully prepared for the trials ahead will be tested, having to apply every ounce of their skill and creativity to succeed. A party can handle between two to three of these encounters in a single adventuring day.": "艰难的遭遇是一种残酷的经历。如果一支队伍在毫无准备的情况下进入，他们将遭受可怕的后果：死亡、大量的资源消耗和对故事的负面影响。即使是对前面的考验有充分准备的队伍也会受到考验，必须运用他们的每一盎司的技能和创造力才能成功。在一个冒险日中，一个团队可以处理两到三个这样的遭遇。",
	"A deadly encounter is an extraordinary event that can smash even the most powerful heroes into pieces. Every time you run one of these encounters, an unprepared party should be guaranteed defeat in one fashion or another. Nothing the party does should be enough to assure victory, only provide them a fighting chance. Your players should feel like the encounter threatens to end their adventuring career and should require an extraordinary amount of skill (and luck) to emerge unscathed. Most deadly encounters aren't lethal enough to actually end the campaign but should have significant consequences for failure. However, if you have the iron will required to let your game end based on the encounter's outcome, using an appropriate creature bearing the TPK brand can make that a reality. A party can handle one of these encounters in a single adventuring day, commonly requiring a long rest immediately afterward.": "致命的遭遇是一个非同寻常的事件，甚至可以将最强大的英雄打成碎片。每次遇到这种情况时，没有准备的队伍都会以这样或那样的方式失败。队伍所做的一切都不足以保证胜利，只能为他们提供一个战斗机会。你的玩家应该感觉到这种遭遇会威胁到他们的冒险生涯，应该需要大量的技巧（和运气）才能毫发无损。大多数致命的遭遇并不致命，不足以真正结束活动，但应该对失败有重大影响。然而，如果你有足够的意志力让你的游戏根据遭遇战的结果而结束，那么使用带有TPK标志的适当的生物可以使之成为现实。一个团队可以在一个冒险日内处理一个这样的遭遇战，通常需要在之后立即进行长时间的休息。",

While not within a host, the mind warper can infect any creature with an Intelligence of 4 or higher that comes within 90 feet of it. If the host is reduced to 0 hit points, the mind warper can infect a new creature in this manner. Creatures immune to disease can still be infected by the mind warper but have advantage on saving throws against it. If an infected creature is affected by a spell or effect that would remove a disease, the mind warper remains in the creature but loses 35 hit points. It may only infect a single creature at a time, and when the ooze is slain, the infected creature is cured of the disease.": "心灵扭曲者是一种微小的、有知觉的疾病。它无法被锁定，只有在感染生物时才能受到伤害。当不在宿主体内时，心灵扭曲者可以感染任何智力为4或更高的生物，并在其90英尺内。如果宿主的生命值降至0，心灵术士可以用这种方式感染一个新的生物。对疾病免疫的生物仍然可以被心灵术士感染，但在对它的救赎上有优势。如果被感染的生物受到可以消除疾病的法术或效果的影响，心灵扭曲者仍然留在该生物体内，但会失去35点生命值。它一次只能感染一个生物，而当渗水者被杀死时，被感染的生物会被治愈。",
	"Additionally, at the start of each of its turns, an infected creature can attempt a {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the mind warper leaves the infected creature and infects a new creature with an Intelligence of 4 or higher within 90 feet. If there are no such creatures in range, the mind warper remains in its host but loses 35 hit points.": "此外，在它每个回合的开始，被感染的生物可以尝试一个{@dc 20}智慧救赎。如果成功，心灵扭曲者就会离开被感染的生物，并感染90英尺范围内智力值为4或更高的新生物。如果范围内没有这样的生物，心灵术士就会留在它的宿主体内，但失去35点生命值。",
	"When an infected creature takes damage other than psychic damage, it takes additional psychic damage equal to the damage taken. This additional damage is not split with the mind warper via the Damage Transfer feature.": "当一个被感染的生物受到精神伤害以外的伤害时，它会受到与所受伤害相等的额外精神伤害。这个额外的伤害不会通过伤害转移功能与心灵扭曲者分割。",
	"{@atk ms} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature. {@h}23 ({@damage 4d8 + 5}) psychic damage.": "{@atk ms} {@hit 10}击中，到达0英尺，一个生物。{@h}23 ({@damage 4d8 + 5})精神伤害。",
	"The mind warper forces the creature it is infecting to attempt a {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw or become possessed by the ooze. The target becomes {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of its body, and the mind warper controls the body without depriving the target of awareness.": "心灵扭曲者迫使它所感染的生物尝试一个{@dc 20}的智慧救赎，否则就会被敖包所占有。目标会变成{@condition incapacitated}并失去对身体的控制，而心灵术士会控制身体而不剥夺目标的意识。",
	"The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the mind warper ends the possession as a bonus action, or the mind warper no longer infects the creature.": "占有会持续到身体下降到0命中率，心灵术士以额外行动结束占有，或者心灵术士不再感染该生物。",
	"The mind warper unleashes a psychic wave of agony in a 60-foot radius centered on the creature it is infecting. Each creature other than the infected creature must succeed on a {@dc 20} Intelligence saving throw or be {@condition stunned} for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.": "心灵扭曲者在以被感染的生物为中心的60英尺半径范围内释放出痛苦的精神波动。除了被感染的生物外，其他生物必须成功地进行智力测验，否则就会在1分钟内受到{@dc 20}的影响。受影响的生物可以在其每个回合结束时重复这个蓄力动作以结束效果。",
	"When anything other than the soul rot deals damage to the infected creature, the soul rot takes half the damage dealt to the infected creature, and the infected creature takes the other half (before damage resistances and immunities are applied).": "当灵魂腐烂以外的任何东西对被感染的生物造成伤害时，灵魂腐烂承受对被感染的生物造成的一半伤害，而被感染的生物则承受另一半伤害（在抗伤害和免疫力被应用之前）。"
