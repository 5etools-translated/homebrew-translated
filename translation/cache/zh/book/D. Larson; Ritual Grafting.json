	"The idea of the magical grafting system is that a person has the ability (as long as they take the proper feat) to take a portion of an existing, willing creature, and transplant it onto their own body, or the body of another creature, to modify it in such a way that it provides some sort of bonus or ability.": "魔法嫁接系统的理念是，一个人有能力（只要他们采取适当的特技）从现有的、愿意的生物中抽取一部分，并将其移植到自己的身体上，或移植到另一个生物的身体上，以这样的方式修改它，使其提供某种奖励或能力。",
	"The idea of grafting is frowned upon in some societies, and certainly isn't cheap, but as technology progresses and time passes, the dangers of the grafting process have been significantly lessened.": "嫁接的想法在一些社会中是不受欢迎的，当然也不便宜，但随着技术的进步和时间的推移，嫁接过程的危险性已经大大降低。",
	"The grafting process comes with a certain set of rules that cannot be broken:": "嫁接过程有一定的规则，不能破坏。",
	"{@b Grafts can only be created and applied by someone who has taken the appropriate feat.} Unlike the creation of magical items, which is similar in theory, the creator of grafts must be able to very delicately manipulate bio energy on a minute scale. The following feats allow a player to work with such magics: {@i {@optfeature Deathless Fleshgrafter|DLRG}}, {@i {@optfeature Eldeen Plantgrafter|DLRG}} and {@i {@optfeature Elemental Grafter|DLRG}}.": "{@b Grafts can only be created and applied by someone who has taken the appropriate feat.}与魔法物品的创造不同，这在理论上是相似的，移植物的创造者必须能够在微小的范围内非常精细地操纵生物能量。以下功法允许玩家使用这种魔法：{@i {@optfeature Deathless Fleshgrafter|DLRG}}、{@i {@optfeature Eldeen Plantgrafter|DLRG}}和{@i {@optfeature Elemental Grafter|DLRG}}。",
	"{@b An individual may only have a total of five grafts grown on their body, and all such grafts have to be of the same type.} Much like a player can only attune to so many magical items, a body can only handle so much augmentation before it's overwhelmed by the biomagical signals, which often leads to madness, and sometimes death. No part of the body (head, legs, skin, flesh, and arms) can support more than one graft, and no individual can have grafts of two different types (deathless, elemental, or plant).": "{@b An individual may only have a total of five grafts grown on their body, and all such grafts have to be of the same type.}就像玩家只能适应这么多的魔法物品一样，在被生物魔法信号淹没之前，身体只能承受这么多的增强，这往往会导致疯狂，有时甚至死亡。身体的任何部分（头部、腿部、皮肤、肉体和手臂）都不能支持一个以上的移植，而且任何个人都不能拥有两种不同类型的移植（无死亡、元素或植物）。",
	"{@b Using a graft requires sacrifice from the host to be successful.} Grafts take a toll on the body of the host, and in most cases it only applies a slight negative to the host's hit point total. Some of the harder to apply grafts have a heavier cost, such as permanent ability score reduction, or causing permanent disadvantage on certain saves or checks. These costs cannot be bypassed while the graft is being worn, and grafts can only be removed by the same individuals capable of applying them.": "{@b Using a graft requires sacrifice from the host to be successful.} 移植会对宿主的身体造成伤害，在大多数情况下，它只对宿主的总命中率产生轻微的负面影响。一些较难应用的移植物有较重的代价，如永久的能力分数降低，或在某些救赎或检查中造成永久的不利条件。这些代价在移植物被穿戴时是无法绕过的，而且移植物只能由能够应用它们的同一个人移除。",
	"{@b All grafts must come from a donor creature, or from tissues taken from one or more in a laboratory setting.} If taken from a donor, the given tissue must be no more than seven days old at the time of application on the host.": "{@b All grafts must come from a donor creature, or from tissues taken from one or more in a laboratory setting.}如果取自捐赠者，所给的组织在应用于宿主时必须不超过七天。",
	"{@b Grafts can be difficult to remove.} Grafts have no statistics of their own, and cannot be targeted or damaged separately from the creature to which they are grafted. A character with the appropriate feat can remove a graft safely, but it requires 8 hours of work in a quiet setting. Without the proper feat, a graft can only be removed by removing the part of the body to which it is attached, but a graft removed in this manner dies immediately. Likewise, if a character with a graft is killed, the graft dies with them.": "{@b Grafts can be difficult to remove.}嫁接物本身没有统计资料，而且不能与被嫁接的生物分开成为目标或被损坏。拥有适当特技的角色可以安全地移除移植体，但需要在安静的环境中工作8小时。如果没有适当的特技，只能通过移除附着在身体上的部分来移除嫁接物，但以这种方式移除的嫁接物会立即死亡。同样地，如果一个有嫁接物的角色被杀，嫁接物也会随他们而死。",
	"{@b A graft is not a magical item.} It does not give off magical energy once completed (although the creation of a graft may require spells in its construction), and it does not take up a body slot like a magical item would. A graft is not affected by spells such as dispel magic or antimagic field.": "{@b A graft is not a magical item.}一旦完成，它不会释放出魔法能量（尽管在建造嫁接物时可能需要法术），而且它不会像魔法物品那样占用一个体位。嫁接物不受驱散魔法或反魔法领域等法术的影响。",
	"Similar to removing a graft, creating one also requires 8 hours of work in a quiet, comfortable setting, and a supply of materials (including the donated tissue). The cost of material supplies is included in the creation cost of the graft.": "与切除移植物类似，创建一个移植物也需要在安静、舒适的环境中工作8小时，并需要供应材料（包括捐赠的组织）。材料供应的费用包括在移植物的制作费用中。",
	"Otherwise, creating a graft is very similar to crafting an item of magical quality, including the costs to create, the time required, preparation of spells, and expenditure of components. Unlike some magical items, grafts need not be crafted over multiple days- a crafter may spend a day here and there to tend a lab-grown tissue graft, but it won't be functional until the total required amount of time has been spent on it. In addition, the character cannot spend more than a week in between the days spent working on the incomplete graft, or it will die, and the character will lose a portion of the gp cost involved in the graft's creation equal to the amount of time spent on it before it died.": "否则，创造移植物与制作魔法品质的物品非常相似，包括创造的成本、所需的时间、法术的准备和组件的支出。与一些魔法物品不同，移植物不需要在多日内制作完成--制作者可以在这里和那里花一天时间来照料实验室培育的组织移植物，但在花完所需的总时间之前，它不会发挥作用。此外，角色在不完整的移植体上花费的时间不能超过一周，否则它就会死亡，而且角色将损失一部分创造移植体所涉及的gp成本，相当于在它死亡前花费的时间。",
	"A character must spend 8 hours on the grafting process on each day that he works on the graft. Failure to do so does not result in lost components or gold, but the day's work is wasted.": "一个角色必须在每一天的嫁接过程中花费8小时。如果不这样做，不会导致组件或金币的损失，但这一天的工作是浪费的。",
	"The art of grafting the flesh of an undying onto a worthy elven hero has long been a part of Aerenal Elven culture, and they are the only known group on Eberron to have mastered the craft until very recently.": "将不死之身的肉体移植到有价值的精灵英雄身上的艺术，长期以来一直是艾瑞纳精灵文化的一部分，他们是艾伯伦上唯一已知的掌握这项技艺的群体，直到最近。",
	"Deathless grafts were created for more than one purpose, one of which being that the undying guardians of Aerenal needed to know which particular elves were worthy of the power and responsibilities of the deathless. The grafts were also used as a badge of honor for those few brave elves who fought admirably for their nation.": "创造无死角移植物的目的不止一个，其中之一是艾瑞纳的不朽守护者需要知道哪些特定的精灵值得拥有无死角的力量和责任。这些移植物也被用来作为少数勇敢的精灵的荣誉徽章，他们为自己的国家而战，令人钦佩。",
	"The Aereni create grafts by using the voluntarily donated flesh of the deathless, but secret cabals are known to grow and harvest flesh and bone for their own grafting purposes.": "艾瑞尼人通过使用自愿捐献的无死亡者的肉体来创造移植物，但众所周知，秘密的小集团为自己的移植物目的而种植和收获肉体和骨骼。",
	"Deathless grafts follow the same general rules for grafts described above. Adding a deathless graft requires access to the {@i {@optfeature Deathless Fleshgrafter|DLRG}} feat:": "无死亡移植物遵循上述移植物的一般规则。增加一个无死亡移植物需要获得{@i {@optfeature Deathless Fleshgrafter|DLRG}}的特技。",
	"The flesh from the arm of an undying ancestor has been grafted over your own arm. You gain the benefit of its great strength, as well as the ability to to channel positive energy to either beneficial or harmful ends.": "一个不朽的祖先的手臂上的肉被移植到你自己的手臂上。你获得了它巨大力量的好处，以及引导正能量达到有益或有害目的的能力。",
	"{@b Description.} One of your arms is incongruous with the rest of your appearance, sheathed in the deathless flesh of and undying ancestor. Now taut and corpse-white in color, the flesh of the arm of the ancestor is withered and dry to the touch, but this appearance conceals great strength. Your fingers are long and nearly skeletal, and the arm smells of a dry and dusty tomb.": "{@b Description.} 你的一只手臂与你其他的外表不协调，它被不死的祖先的不死之肉所覆盖。现在，祖先的手臂绷得紧紧的，呈尸白色，肉质枯萎，触摸起来很干燥，但这种外表掩盖了巨大的力量。你的手指很长，几乎是骨架，手臂上有干燥和灰尘的坟墓的气味。",
	"{@b Activation.} The arm can channel positive energy as a standard action that can either heal the living or harm the undead. Both require a melee touch.": "{@b Activation.}手臂可以引导正能量作为一个标准动作，可以治疗活人或伤害亡灵。两者都需要一个近战的接触。",
	"{@b Effect.} The arm of the ancestor grants you advantage on Climb and Swim checks, advantage when grappling, and any weapon wielded by this arm gets a +1 to its damage rolls.": "{@b Effect.}祖先的手臂使你在攀爬和游泳检查中获得优势，在抓取时获得优势，并且由这只手臂挥舞的任何武器在其伤害卷上获得+1。",
	"In addition to this, you can touch a creature to bestow a beneficial or harmful effect. Living creatures you touch gain 3 (1d6) temporary hit points, and undead creatures take 3 (1d6) radiant damage. This effect recharges after a short rest.": "除此以外，你可以触摸一个生物来赋予其有益或有害的效果。你触摸的生物获得3（1d6）个临时命中率，而亡灵生物则受到3（1d6）个辐射伤害。这种效果在短暂的休息后会重新充电。",
	"{@b Sacrifice.} Adding this graft takes a physical toll, numbing your sense of touch and making the new arm less nimble than you're used to. As a result, you take a -1 to your Dexterity score.": "{@b Sacrifice.}添加这种嫁接物会造成身体上的损失，使你的触觉麻木，并使新的手臂不如你所习惯的那样灵活。因此，你的灵巧评分为-1。",
	"{@b Construction.} Requires {@i {@optfeature Deathless Fleshgrafter|DLRG}}, {@spell Enhance Ability|PHB} spell (to give the graft the Bull's Strength ability during creation), 3,250 gp, and 9 days.": "{@b Construction.}需要{@i {@optfeature Deathless Fleshgrafter|DLRG}}，{@spell Enhance Ability|PHB}法术(在创造过程中给予嫁接者公牛的力量能力)，3250金币，和9天。",

	"{@b Description.} Thin, strong layers of bone cover your skin. The bone is pale white, stretching over every vulnerable area from your collarbone to your ankles. The bone plating is smooth to the touch, and it moves as you do, not hindering your movements in the least. The plating and your skin are one featureless surface; no one can tell where one ends and the other begins.": "{@b Description.} 薄而结实的骨骼层覆盖着你的皮肤。骨头是淡白色的，延伸到从你的锁骨到你的脚踝的每一个脆弱区域。骨头镀层触摸起来很光滑，它随着你的动作移动，丝毫不妨碍你的动作。骨板和你的皮肤是一个没有特征的表面；没有人能够告诉你一个在哪里结束，另一个在哪里开始。",

	"This graft provides a bit of insight into the long-term mindset and wisdom of the undying councilors of Aerenal.
