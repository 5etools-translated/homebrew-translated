	"Resourceful Scavengers. Grimalkinn make ingenious use of what other civilizations cast off. They re-forge scrap metal into tools and weapons, and sew discarded rags into exquisite clothing. They are especially creative when it comes to food, hunting creatures that other cultures consider vermin and cooking foods others consider spoiled. Grimalkinn who leave their clans often find employment as cooks on dangerous expeditions, using their native culinary skills to conjure delicious meals out of unlikely ingredients.": "资源丰富的拾荒者。格里玛尔金人巧妙地利用其他文明遗弃的东西。他们把废旧金属重新锻造成工具和武器，把废弃的破布缝制成精美的衣服。当涉及到食物时，他们尤其具有创造性，他们猎杀其他文化认为是害虫的生物，烹饪其他文化认为是腐败的食物。离开部族的格里马金人经常在危险的探险中找到厨师的工作，利用他们的本地烹饪技巧，用不可能的原料变出美味的食物。",
	"Beast Talk. Grimalkinn share a talent for communicating with other creatures.

It is said that elf-raised lobster breeds are more affectionate and playful, while the merfolk's preferred breeds are aggressive hunters of aquatic pests.

When that fails, an octopus can release a cloud of dark ink into the water around it.

	"Keyhole Escape. The only hard part of an octopus' body is its beak, which resides underneath its tentacles.

Captive octopuses frequently escape their enclosures, no matter how secure their keepers think they are.": "钥匙孔逃生。章鱼身体唯一坚硬的部分是它的喙，它位于触角的下面。正因为如此，章鱼可以挤过它的喙所能通过的任何空间，把它身体的其他部分压缩到一个惊人的程度。圈养的章鱼经常逃离它们的围栏，不管它们的饲养者认为它们有多安全。",
	"Strange Intelligence. An octopus' intelligence rivals most humanoids, but their thoughts are as alien as any extraplanar being's. They are able to use objects as tools, or build simple shelters from their surroundings. Much of the octopus' mind and thoughts are given to controlling its eight arms, which move and even think independently of one another. Any attempt to read an octopus' mind thus finds a jumble of simultaneous thoughts and impulses.": "奇怪的智力。章鱼的智力可与大多数人类相媲美，但它们的思想却与任何星外生物一样陌生。它们能够使用物体作为工具，或利用周围环境建造简单的庇护所。章鱼的大部分心智和思想都用于控制它的八条手臂，这些手臂可以独立移动甚至思考。因此，任何试图解读章鱼思想的努力都会发现其思想和冲动同时存在的混乱局面。",

	"Playing Dead. Opossums have a famous habit of \"playing dead\" when in danger. To the surprise of many, it's actually an involuntary survival mechanism. A threatened opossum will enter a state that is a remarkably convincing imitation of death. The opossum loses consciousness, goes stiff, and even produces a scent akin to that of a dead animal. Experienced hunters exploit this state, simply picking a stunned opossum up by its tail for later use. They return to consciousness on their own, no worse for wear, after about an hour. Younger, less experienced opossums may enter this state whenever something startles them.": "装死。负鼠有一个著名的习惯，就是在遇到危险时 \"装死\"。令许多人惊讶的是，这实际上是一种非自愿的生存机制。受到威胁的负鼠会进入一种模仿死亡的状态，非常有说服力。负鼠失去意识，身体僵硬，甚至产生类似于动物尸体的气味。有经验的猎人会利用这种状态，简单地把晕倒的负鼠的尾巴捡起来，以备后用。大约一小时后，它们就会自己恢复意识，不会有什么大碍。年轻的、经验不足的负鼠，只要有东西惊吓它们，就可能进入这种状态。",

Humanoids who can look past the opossum's fierce appearance find they can be very helpful, even friendly, creatures to have around.": "食蛇者。负鼠对许多毒蛇的毒液有天然的免疫力，它们喜欢吃这些毒蛇。它们还吞食大量的蜱虫。能看清负鼠凶猛外表的人类发现它们可以是非常有用的，甚至是友好的生物。",

However, they have reason to distrust humanoids, who have historically hunted otters for their waterproof pelts.": "在野外，水獭沿水体挖掘大量的洞穴，与半打或更多的水獭家庭生活在一起。水獭对其家庭群体的成员很友好，在需要保护他们的时候也很勇敢。它们对那些设法与它们交好的人类也表现出同样的品质。然而，它们有理由不信任人类，因为人类在历史上曾因水獭的防水皮毛而猎杀它们。",

However, any sane adventurer would rather encounter a horde of capybaras than even a single feral rat, since capybaras are friendly and harmless.": "水豚是世界上最大的自然啮齿动物，甚至比困扰城市下水道的大老鼠还要大一些。然而，任何理智的冒险家都宁愿遇到成群的水豚，也不愿遇到一只野鼠，因为水豚是友好的，无害的。",
	"Capybaras live in large family groups, ranging in size from as few as ten to as many as one hundred capybaras. They enjoy the company of other creatures that approach them peacefully.": "水豚生活在大的家庭群体中，大小不一，少则十只，多则一百只水豚。它们喜欢与其他生物为伴，和平地接近它们。",
	"Water Rats. Always dwelling near bodies of water, capybaras are excellent swimmers. They are so at home in the water that they can even sleep while submerged, with only their noses above the surface.": "水老鼠。水豚总是居住在水体附近，是优秀的游泳者。它们在水中非常自如，甚至可以在水下睡觉，只有鼻子露出水面。",
	"Soothing Nature. One legend speaks of a great hunter spirit, who fired an arrow that missed its quarry. The spirit searched for the arrow for days, becoming more and more frustrated as time passed. It was a humble capybara who spoke soothingly to the god, allowing them to relax and think unclouded by frustration. The spirit then made enough arrows to fill a dozen quivers using materials from the forest. Whether or not the tale is true, the rotund and placid capybara exudes a sense of calm that extends to the creatures around it. It is simply hard to stay angry in the company of a capybara.": "抚慰自然。有一个传说，说的是一个伟大的猎人精神，他射出的箭没有射中猎物。神灵找了好几天，随着时间的推移，变得越来越沮丧。这时，一只卑微的水豚对神灵说了些舒缓的话，让他们放松下来，不受挫折的影响而思考。然后，神灵用森林里的材料制作了足够多的箭来装满一打箭筒。无论这个故事是否属实，肥硕而平和的水豚散发着一种平静的感觉，并延伸到它周围的生物。在水豚的陪伴下很难保持愤怒。",

	"Rabbits are recognized by their long ears and powerful legs, the first of which help them detect predators from a distance and the second of which help them jump away with great speed. Humanoids domesticate rabbits for a range of uses, from their meat to their warm fur, or simply for the sake of company. Rabbits raised among humanoids can be surprisingly tolerant of creatures they would flee in the wild, such as cats, dogs, and other humanoids.": "兔子被认为是长耳朵和强有力的腿，前者帮助它们从远处发现捕食者，后者帮助它们以极快的速度跳开。人类驯养兔子的目的有很多，从它们的肉到它们温暖的皮毛，或者仅仅是为了陪伴。在人族中长大的兔子对它们在野外会逃离的生物有惊人的容忍度，如猫、狗和其他人族。",
	"Rabbits in the wild tend to live in large groups, and most live in extensive underground burrows called warrens. These convoluted networks of tunnels can stretch underground for miles, piercing the walls of caves and dungeons alike.": "野生的兔子往往生活在大群中，而且大多数生活在广泛的地下洞穴中，称为 \"巢穴\"。这些错综复杂的隧道网络可以在地下延伸数英里，穿透山洞和地宫的墙壁。",
	"Rabbit Lore. Rabbits are said to enjoy a rich tradition of legends and stories which they pass down across generations. Every warren contains at least one rabbit who can recount the history of their species' creation, and recall the right story to lift the other rabbits' spirits in dark times. Some legends even say rabbits came from the moon during a particularly starry night.": "兔子的传说。据说兔子享有丰富的传说和故事的传统，它们世代相传。每个兔群中至少有一只兔子能讲述他们物种的创造历史，并能在黑暗时期回忆起正确的故事来鼓舞其他兔子的精神。有些传说甚至说兔子是在一个星光灿烂的夜晚从月亮上下来的。",
	"Symbols of Luck. Rabbits are a particular favorite of trickster deities and their associated heroes, who respect the rabbit's ability to avoid consequences and enemies alike. The gods have blessed rabbits with a greater than normal share of luck. However, rabbits can only avail themselves of that luck because they are eternally vigilant for enemies. Some humanoids suppose that they can avail themselves of a rabbit's luck by carrying a rabbit's foot, but it stands to reason that a lucky rabbit would have been able to avoid such a grim fate.": "运气的象征。兔子是诡计多端的神灵和他们相关的英雄们的特别喜爱，他们尊重兔子避免后果和敌人的能力。诸神赐予兔子比一般人更多的运气。然而，兔子只能利用这种运气，因为它们对敌人永远保持着警惕。一些人类认为，他们可以通过携带兔子的脚来利用兔子的运气，但按理说，幸运的兔子应该能够避免这种严峻的命运。",

	"Squirrels are small, tree-climbing rodents with distinctive, fluffy tails. They are especially lively in spring, when they can be seen chasing each other up and down trees, or leaping from one branch to another.": "松鼠是小型的、爬树的啮齿动物，有独特的、蓬松的尾巴。它们在春天特别活泼，可以看到它们在树上和树下互相追逐，或从一个树枝跳到另一个树枝。",
	"Urbanites. Squirrels are a common sight in humanoid cities, wherever trees line the street or parks provide a green space within city walls. Such urban squirrels have no fear of humanoids, acting with sizable boldness and aggression. They may even approach citizens to beg for food, or outright steal belongings they take interest in.": "城市人。松鼠在人形城市中是一种常见的景象，不管是在街道两旁的树木还是在城墙内的公园提供的绿色空间。这样的城市松鼠对人形生物没有恐惧感，行动起来相当大胆和有侵略性。它们甚至可能接近市民乞讨食物，或直接偷取它们感兴趣的物品。",
	"Hidden Treasure. Squirrels gather edible nuts in the fall and bury them, laying away stashes of food to help them through the winter. They have no compunctions about stealing another squirrel's hidden nuts, a habit they use to make up for how often they forget where they've buried their own nuts. Squirrels have a keen sense for where something has been buried, and a strong compulsion to dig it up again and see what it is. As a result, some treasure hunters adopt them as mascots.": "隐藏的宝藏。松鼠在秋天收集可食用的坚果并把它们埋起来，把食物藏起来以帮助它们过冬。它们对偷取另一只松鼠藏匿的坚果毫无顾忌，它们用这种习惯来弥补它们经常忘记自己的坚果被埋在哪里。松鼠对被埋藏的东西有敏锐的感觉，并有强烈的强迫性，想把它再挖出来看看是什么东西。因此，一些寻宝者采用它们作为吉祥物。",
	"Treetop Spies. Squirrels have keener eyes than most other rodents. When they see a predator or other threat, they give a chittering call that alerts other animals in the area. When a hunter finds the forest strangely empty, they often have the squirrels' vigilance to thank. Skilled elven rangers often cultivate spy networks among squirrels in order to gather news of comings and goings in the forest.": "树梢上的间谍。松鼠的眼睛比其他大多数啮齿动物更敏锐。当它们看到捕食者或其他威胁时，它们会发出叽叽喳喳的叫声，提醒该地区的其他动物注意。当猎人发现森林里奇怪地空无一人时，他们往往要感谢松鼠的警觉性。熟练的精灵护林员经常在松鼠中培养间谍网络，以便收集森林中来往的消息。",

	"It's unknown what possessed the first adventurer to try to domesticate a giant scorpion, but after many generations of breeding they eventually managed it. Sovereign scorpions are a more companionable breed of giant scorpion, with just enough intelligence to train. Though they are fearsome in appearance, their venom is weaker than that of many smaller scorpion species.": "不知道是什么原因让第一个冒险家尝试驯化巨蝎，但经过许多代的繁殖，他们最终成功了。主宰者蝎子是一种更容易相处的巨蝎品种，有足够的智慧来训练。虽然它们的外表很可怕，但它们的毒液比许多小型蝎子品种的毒液要弱一些。",
	"Paralytic Venom. The sovereign scorpion's sting is not directly fatal to most creatures. When hunting, they use their venom to paralyze small prey so that they can consume it later. Larger creatures may find that the venom slows them down without paralyzing them completely. A trained sovereign scorpion will not harm a creature it has stung, leaving the victim for its master to deal with—an important safeguard, in case the master is the one stung.": "麻痹性毒液。君主蝎的刺对大多数生物来说不是直接致命的。狩猎时，它们用毒液来麻痹小的猎物，以便它们以后可以食用。较大的生物可能会发现，毒液会使它们慢下来，而不会完全瘫痪它们。训练有素的君主蝎不会伤害被它蜇伤的生物，而是将受害者留给它的主人来处理--这是一项重要的保障措施，以防主人被蜇伤。",

	"Feral Sovereigns.

Wild sovereign scorpions have adapted to a wide range of habitats, from deserts to swamps.": "野生的主权者。那种把主权蝎作为宠物饲养的人也往往有很高的死亡率，这导致许多驯化的主权蝎被释放到野外。野生的主权蝎已经适应了广泛的栖息地，从沙漠到沼泽。",
	"Sovereign scorpions in the wild tend to become territorial and aggressive. Rather than driving off smaller scorpions in the area, they gather them to aid in defending their territory. In fact, feral sovereign scorpions often rule over small \"kingdoms,\" teeming with scorpions of many different sizes. These regions become extremely dangerous, but when the sovereign dies the smaller scorpions abandon the area.": "野生的主权蝎子倾向于成为领地和攻击性。它们不是赶走该地区的小蝎子，而是聚集它们来帮助保卫自己的领土。事实上，野性的主权蝎子常常统治着小型的 \"王国\"，其中充斥着许多不同大小的蝎子。这些地区变得非常危险，但当主宰者死亡时，较小的蝎子就会放弃该地区。",
