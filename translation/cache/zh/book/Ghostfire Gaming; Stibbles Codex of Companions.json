	"Resourceful Scavengers. Grimalkinn make ingenious use of what other civilizations cast off. They re-forge scrap metal into tools and weapons, and sew discarded rags into exquisite clothing. They are especially creative when it comes to food, hunting creatures that other cultures consider vermin and cooking foods others consider spoiled. Grimalkinn who leave their clans often find employment as cooks on dangerous expeditions, using their native culinary skills to conjure delicious meals out of unlikely ingredients.": "资源丰富的拾荒者。格里玛尔金人巧妙地利用其他文明遗弃的东西。他们把废旧金属重新锻造成工具和武器，把废弃的破布缝制成精美的衣服。当涉及到食物时，他们尤其具有创造性，他们猎杀其他文化认为是害虫的生物，烹饪其他文化认为是腐败的食物。离开部族的格里马金人经常在危险的探险中找到厨师的工作，利用他们的本地烹饪技巧，用不可能的原料变出美味的食物。",
	"Beast Talk. Grimalkinn share a talent for communicating with other creatures.

It is said that elf-raised lobster breeds are more affectionate and playful, while the merfolk's preferred breeds are aggressive hunters of aquatic pests.

When that fails, an octopus can release a cloud of dark ink into the water around it.

	"Keyhole Escape. The only hard part of an octopus' body is its beak, which resides underneath its tentacles.

Captive octopuses frequently escape their enclosures, no matter how secure their keepers think they are.": "钥匙孔逃生。章鱼身体唯一坚硬的部分是它的喙，它位于触角的下面。正因为如此，章鱼可以挤过它的喙所能通过的任何空间，把它身体的其他部分压缩到一个惊人的程度。圈养的章鱼经常逃离它们的围栏，不管它们的饲养者认为它们有多安全。",
	"Strange Intelligence. An octopus' intelligence rivals most humanoids, but their thoughts are as alien as any extraplanar being's. They are able to use objects as tools, or build simple shelters from their surroundings. Much of the octopus' mind and thoughts are given to controlling its eight arms, which move and even think independently of one another. Any attempt to read an octopus' mind thus finds a jumble of simultaneous thoughts and impulses.": "奇怪的智力。章鱼的智力可与大多数人类相媲美，但它们的思想却与任何星外生物一样陌生。它们能够使用物体作为工具，或利用周围环境建造简单的庇护所。章鱼的大部分心智和思想都用于控制它的八条手臂，这些手臂可以独立移动甚至思考。因此，任何试图解读章鱼思想的努力都会发现其思想和冲动同时存在的混乱局面。",

	"Playing Dead. Opossums have a famous habit of \"playing dead\" when in danger. To the surprise of many, it's actually an involuntary survival mechanism. A threatened opossum will enter a state that is a remarkably convincing imitation of death. The opossum loses consciousness, goes stiff, and even produces a scent akin to that of a dead animal. Experienced hunters exploit this state, simply picking a stunned opossum up by its tail for later use. They return to consciousness on their own, no worse for wear, after about an hour. Younger, less experienced opossums may enter this state whenever something startles them.": "装死。负鼠有一个著名的习惯，就是在遇到危险时 \"装死\"。令许多人惊讶的是，这实际上是一种非自愿的生存机制。受到威胁的负鼠会进入一种模仿死亡的状态，非常有说服力。负鼠失去意识，身体僵硬，甚至产生类似于动物尸体的气味。有经验的猎人会利用这种状态，简单地把晕倒的负鼠的尾巴捡起来，以备后用。大约一小时后，它们就会自己恢复意识，不会有什么大碍。年轻的、经验不足的负鼠，只要有东西惊吓它们，就可能进入这种状态。",

Humanoids who can look past the opossum's fierce appearance find they can be very helpful, even friendly, creatures to have around.": "食蛇者。负鼠对许多毒蛇的毒液有天然的免疫力，它们喜欢吃这些毒蛇。它们还吞食大量的蜱虫。能看清负鼠凶猛外表的人类发现它们可以是非常有用的，甚至是友好的生物。",

However, they have reason to distrust humanoids, who have historically hunted otters for their waterproof pelts.": "在野外，水獭沿水体挖掘大量的洞穴，与半打或更多的水獭家庭生活在一起。水獭对其家庭群体的成员很友好，在需要保护他们的时候也很勇敢。它们对那些设法与它们交好的人类也表现出同样的品质。然而，它们有理由不信任人类，因为人类在历史上曾因水獭的防水皮毛而猎杀它们。",

	"Soothing Nature. One legend speaks of a great hunter spirit, who fired an arrow that missed its quarry. The spirit searched for the arrow for days, becoming more and more frustrated as time passed. It was a humble capybara who spoke soothingly to the god, allowing them to relax and think unclouded by frustration. The spirit then made enough arrows to fill a dozen quivers using materials from the forest. Whether or not the tale is true, the rotund and placid capybara exudes a sense of calm that extends to the creatures around it. It is simply hard to stay angry in the company of a capybara.": "抚慰自然。有一个传说，说的是一个伟大的猎人精神，他射出的箭没有射中猎物。神灵找了好几天，随着时间的推移，变得越来越沮丧。这时，一只卑微的水豚对神灵说了些舒缓的话，让他们放松下来，不受挫折的影响而思考。然后，神灵用森林里的材料制作了足够多的箭来装满一打箭筒。无论这个故事是否属实，肥硕而平和的水豚散发着一种平静的感觉，并延伸到它周围的生物。在水豚的陪伴下很难保持愤怒。",

Rabbits raised among humanoids can be surprisingly tolerant of creatures they would flee in the wild, such as cats, dogs, and other humanoids.": "兔子被认为是长耳朵和强有力的腿，前者帮助它们从远处发现捕食者，后者帮助它们以极快的速度跳开。人类驯养兔子的目的有很多，从它们的肉到它们温暖的皮毛，或者仅仅是为了陪伴。在人族中长大的兔子对它们在野外会逃离的生物有惊人的容忍度，如猫、狗和其他人族。",

The gods have blessed rabbits with a greater than normal share of luck. However, rabbits can only avail themselves of that luck because they are eternally vigilant for enemies. Some humanoids suppose that they can avail themselves of a rabbit's luck by carrying a rabbit's foot, but it stands to reason that a lucky rabbit would have been able to avoid such a grim fate.": "运气的象征。兔子是诡计多端的神灵和他们相关的英雄们的特别喜爱，他们尊重兔子避免后果和敌人的能力。诸神赐予兔子比一般人更多的运气。然而，兔子只能利用这种运气，因为它们对敌人永远保持着警惕。一些人类认为，他们可以通过携带兔子的脚来利用兔子的运气，但按理说，幸运的兔子应该能够避免这种严峻的命运。",

They have no compunctions about stealing another squirrel's hidden nuts, a habit they use to make up for how often they forget where they've buried their own nuts. Squirrels have a keen sense for where something has been buried, and a strong compulsion to dig it up again and see what it is. As a result, some treasure hunters adopt them as mascots.": "隐藏的宝藏。松鼠在秋天收集可食用的坚果并把它们埋起来，把食物藏起来以帮助它们过冬。它们对偷取另一只松鼠藏匿的坚果毫无顾忌，它们用这种习惯来弥补它们经常忘记自己的坚果被埋在哪里。松鼠对被埋藏的东西有敏锐的感觉，并有强烈的强迫性，想把它再挖出来看看是什么东西。因此，一些寻宝者采用它们作为吉祥物。",

	"Righteous Mockery. As it fights, a pangol will taunt its enemy with a constant barrage of cutting insults. The pangol does not do this out of cruelty. It intends both to shame its adversary, showing the weakness of evil, and to draw the enemy's anger away from more vulnerable targets. Once the enemies original target has reached safety, the pangol will ball up in its perfect defense and simply wait for victory.": "正义的嘲弄。在战斗中，穿山甲会不断地嘲弄它的敌人，对其进行一连串的侮辱性攻击。猩猩这样做并不是出于残忍的目的。它的目的是羞辱对手，显示邪恶的弱点，并把敌人的怒火从更脆弱的目标身上引开。一旦敌人的原定目标到达安全地带，穿山甲就会在其完美的防守下缩成一团，仅仅等待胜利的到来。",

Woar sharpen their tusks against other members of their pack, a daily ritual that acts as a staple of their behavior.": "战斗力强的獠牙。狼牙像钢铁一样坚硬，像剃刀一样锋利，它的獠牙使它成为一个可怕的对手。上部的獠牙向后弯曲，形成一个保护性的笼子，阻挡针对其面部或眼睛的攻击。下部的獠牙像剑一样向前伸出，野猪用这些獠牙行动起来就像一个经验丰富的剑客一样熟练。狼人用它们的獠牙来对付它们族群中的其他成员，这是一种日常的仪式，也是它们行为的一个主要部分。",

	"Mixological Memory. Perhaps the most useful ability of the animated mug is its memory. The mug can recall any drink that has ever been poured into it, and recreate that drink when it refills itself.

In retrospect, those experiments were a bad idea.": "结合在一起。Gellumps总是面临着食物匮乏的问题，他们更愿意保持微小的体积以保存燃料。然而，在食物充足的情况下，一个人可以与其他胶冻人结合，形成一个更大的渗出物。实验发现，在大量提供温热食物的情况下，任何数量的胶状物到达该地区都可以形成一个单一的巨大单位。如果它们有足够的数量组合在一起，就会突然变成一个著名的立方体威胁，困扰着许多地下城。现在回想起来，这些实验是个坏主意。",
