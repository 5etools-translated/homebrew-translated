	"Archery competitions are common competitive events. The rules are simple: competitors fire at a target and score points depending on how close to the center of the target the arrow strikes. The archer with the most points wins. A staple of medieval tournaments, the archery contest draws bowmen from far and wide to test their skill and accuracy.": "射箭比赛是常见的竞技项目。规则很简单：参赛者向靶子射击，根据箭矢离靶子中心的距离来计分。得分最多的弓箭手获胜。作为中世纪锦标赛的主打项目，射箭比赛吸引了来自远方的弓箭手来测试他们的技能和准确性。",
	"Contests can sometimes attract up fifty or more skilled competitors, and the winner often receives a valuable prize—cash, jewellery or, more commonly, a fine bow or quiver of arrows. In traditional archery contests, contestants fire arrows at a stationary target, though some tournaments use moving targets or have the archers fire from horseback. Usually the target has different locations that are worth different points in a contest, though some contests simply require a contestant to hit the target at all to progress.": "比赛有时可以吸引50个或更多的熟练的竞争者，获胜者通常会得到宝贵的奖品--现金、珠宝或更常见的，一张精美的弓或箭筒。在传统的射箭比赛中，参赛者向一个固定的靶子射箭，尽管有些比赛使用移动的靶子或让弓箭手从马背上射击。通常情况下，目标有不同的位置，在比赛中值得不同的分数，虽然有些比赛只是要求参赛者击中目标才能取得进展。",
	"These mechanics assume an archery contest whose target has different locations worth different amounts of points. Each archer gets a certain number of shots, usually one or three, and winners are determined by who gets the most points in either an elimination or round robin tournament. For each shot, the archer makes an attack roll, and his total attack roll determines how many points he gets. In the case of ties, the target is moved back 100 ft. per round thereafter that there is no winner.": "这些机制假设一个射箭比赛，其目标有不同的位置，价值不同的分数。每个弓箭手有一定的射击次数，通常是一次或三次，在淘汰赛或循环赛中，以谁得到的分数多来决定胜负。每一次射击，弓箭手都要做一个攻击卷，他的总攻击卷决定了他得到多少分。在平局的情况下，目标每轮后移100英尺，此后就没有赢家了。",
	"The first thing you, as the GM, need to do is determine how difficult this tournament is. If it's a simple village affair, the shots may be quite easy for seasoned adventurers; but a tournament involving the cream of a mighty empire might begin with very difficult targets—and many more contestants!": "作为总经理，你需要做的第一件事是确定这场比赛的难度。如果是一个简单的村庄事件，对于经验丰富的冒险家来说，射击可能很容易；但如果是涉及到一个强大帝国的精英的比赛，可能一开始就会有非常困难的目标--而且还有更多的参赛者！\"。",
	"The table in this article shows the attack bonuses of the contestants at each round of a contest. The AC of the target at each contest level is the attack bonus of the competitors +10 (thus giving the average competitor at a given tier of the tournament a 50% chance to succeed). The attack bonuses at the final represent the best of the region, country, world - or even multiverse! You, as the GM, are free to adjust these numbers of course.": "本文中的表格显示了选手在每轮比赛中的攻击奖励。每个竞赛级别的目标的AC值是参赛者的攻击红利+10（从而使某一级别竞赛的平均参赛者有50%的机会成功）。决赛时的攻击加成代表了该地区、国家、世界--甚至多元宇宙的最佳水平！你作为GM，可以自由选择你的目标。当然，你作为GM，可以自由调整这些数字。",
	"Example A competition spanning a whole country begins with The Masses. In the first round, the target's AC is 12 and the competitors have an attack bonus of +2. The following round involves a target with AC 13 and 512 competitors with attack bonuses of +3. By the semi-final, there are 4 competitors with bonuses of +10 shooting at a target with an AC 20, and the final involves two competitors with attack bonuses of +11 shooting at a target with AC 21..": "例子 一个横跨整个国家的比赛以 \"大众 \"开始。在第一轮中，目标的AC为12，竞争者的攻击奖励为+2。下一轮涉及一个AC为13的目标和512个攻击奖金为+3的竞争者。 到了半决赛，有4个奖金为+10的竞争者向一个AC为20的目标射击，而决赛涉及两个攻击奖金为+11的竞争者向一个AC为21的目标射击。",

	"A competitor hits the target and scores 1 point if she hits the target's AC. If she beats the AC by 4, she hits the middle ring and scores 2 points; if he beats it by 8, she hits the bullseye and scores 3 points. In each round, half of the competitors progress (the half with the most points).": "竞争者击中目标，如果她击中目标的AC，得1分。如果她比AC高出4分，她就击中中环，得2分；如果他比AC高出8分，她就击中牛眼，得3分。在每一轮中，有一半的竞争者取得进展（积分最多的那一半）。",
	"You're not expected to roll attack rolls and tally the points for each of 512 competitors in a world-wide tournament. In fact, above 4 competitors, a PC will progress to the next round simply by scoring higher than average number of points. Once you reach the semi-finals, though, you should handle each competitor individually to increase the drama of the occasion.": "在世界范围内的比赛中，你不需要为512个竞争者的每个人滚动攻击卷和统计分数。事实上，在4个以上的竞争者中，个人电脑只需获得高于平均数的分数就能进入下一轮。不过，一旦你进入半决赛，你应该单独处理每个竞争者，以增加比赛的戏剧性。",
	"The average is easy to determine. Over three shots, each competitor is expected to score 3 points. {@i If the PC scores more than 3 points, she progresses to the next round.}": "平均分很容易确定。在三次投篮中，每个参赛者预计会得到3分。{@i If the PC scores more than 3 points, she progresses to the next round.}",
	"Of course, there aren't always 512 competitors. The blank areas on the table represent levels of talent which don't exist in local areas. A village will only provide 8 competitors of note, a town only 64.": "当然，并不总是有512个竞争对手。表格上的空白区域代表了当地不存在的人才水平。一个村子只会提供8个值得注意的竞争者，一个镇子只有64个。",
	"You should create an individual nemesis for the PC in order to personalize the whole process. This nemesis provides narrative background for most of the competitions—jeers, insults, challenges, bets, etc.—but should be rolled for directly once the semifinals are reached. The nemesis will have the attack bonus for the top rating level for the region size used, ensuring that he reaches the final.*": "你应该为PC创建一个单独的克星，以便使整个过程个性化。这个克星为大多数比赛提供叙事背景--嫉妒、侮辱、挑战、打赌等--但一旦进入半决赛，就应该直接进行滚动。该克星将拥有所使用地区规模的最高评级水平的攻击奖励，确保他进入决赛。",
	"Robin Fairfoot, an elven ranger, is competing in a town archery tournament. Her nemesis in this tournament is Boris the Blue, an obnoxious man and the current favorite. Boris' attack bonus is +6. Up until the semi-final, Boris interacts with the PC in a non-mechanical way (the GM plays him taunting Robin); at the semi-final, with 4 competitors, two are regular competitors, one is the PC, and the last is Boris. At this point, the GM starts rolling Boris' attack rolls against the target. He and Robin will likely progress.": "罗宾-费尔福，一个精灵游侠，正在参加一个小镇的射箭比赛。她在这个比赛中的克星是蓝衣人鲍里斯，一个令人讨厌的人，也是目前最受欢迎的人。在半决赛之前，鲍里斯一直以非机械的方式与PC互动（GM扮演他嘲弄罗宾）；在半决赛时，有4个竞争者，两个是普通竞争者，一个是PC，最后一个是鲍里斯。这时，GM开始滚动Boris对目标的攻击卷。他和罗宾很可能会取得进展。",
	"Common variants involve using weapons other than bows. Halflings favor slings or javelins, gnomes enjoy watching blindfolded archery, and dwarves are renowned for throwing hand axes through kegs of ale. You can also use these rules for darts, horseshoes, clay pigeons, or any other type of missile-based contest.": "常见的变体包括使用弓以外的武器。半身人喜欢使用弹弓或标枪，地精喜欢观看蒙眼射箭，而矮人则以用手斧投掷啤酒桶而闻名。你也可以把这些规则用于飞镖、马蹄铁、泥鸽子或任何其他类型的基于导弹的比赛。",
	"Orcs practice Punctureshot archery contests, where the goal is to shoot through several archery targets. Each target is a sheet of painted paper attached to a thin sheet of wood. The contestant doesn't get points based on the accuracy of the shot: instead, if the arrow hits, roll for damage. For every 5 points of damage, the arrow punctures one target and hits the next. Magical arrows are forbidden, but most orcs won't know the difference unless the arrows are obviously enchanted (the target takes energy damage, for example). For every target punctured, 1 point is earned. Sometimes, instead of archery targets, orcs line up prisoners of war. Assume it takes 10 points of damage to to puncture through a helpless torso.": "兽人练习穿刺射箭比赛，目标是射穿几个箭靶。每个靶子都是一张贴在薄木片上的彩纸。参赛者并不根据射击的准确性来获得分数：相反，如果箭射中了，就掷出伤害。每5点伤害，箭就会刺穿一个目标并击中下一个目标。魔法箭是被禁止的，但大多数兽人不会知道其中的区别，除非箭明显被施了魔法（例如，目标受到能量伤害）。每刺穿一个目标，就可以获得1分。有时，兽人会把战俘排成一排，而不是射箭目标。假设刺穿一个无助的躯干需要10点伤害。"
