	"In combat, hordes are often accompanied by powerful individuals which serve to direct and empower the horde by serving as a commander. These creatures should roll initiative as individuals.": "在战斗中，成群结队的人通常都有强大的个体，他们作为指挥官来指挥部落，并赋予部落力量。这些生物应该像个人一样掷出主动权。",
	"The role of a commander is typically assigned to a creature that bears similarities to the horde it commands, but exemplifies itself in some factor. This factor can vary depending on the horde being commanded; some creatures will band together under the strongest champion, while others will follow the wisest tactician. Generally, combat prowess and charisma are used to determine the eligibility of a commander.": "指挥官的角色通常分配给一个与它所指挥的部落有相似之处的生物，但在某些因素上体现了自己。这个因素可以根据被指挥的部落而变化；一些生物会在最强大的冠军手下团结起来，而另一些则会跟随最聪明的战术家。一般来说，战斗力和魅力是用来决定一个指挥官的资格的。",
	"Examples of such creatures include the orc war chief,hobgoblin captain, hobgoblin warlord, and knight, among many others. These creatures typically possess theLeadership action, or otherwise have some method of inspiring or rallying a horde.": "这类生物的例子包括兽人战争酋长、妖精队长、妖精战神和骑士，以及其他许多生物。这些生物通常拥有领导力动作，或者有一些激励或召集部落的方法。",

The commander regains the spent legendary action at the start of its turn.": "当指挥官在它所指挥的部落的60英尺范围内时，指挥官可以在另一个生物的回合结束时采取1个传奇行动，从以下选项中选择。指挥官在其回合开始时重新获得已使用的传奇行动。",

When confronting a horde and commander, there are many methods to bring about a commander's fall from grace.": "为了保持指挥权，指挥官必须保持其在部落中的权威。相反，一个失去部落信任或尊重的指挥官会发现其控制权在逐渐消失。在面对部落和指挥官时，有许多方法可以使指挥官失势。",
	"{@b Arcane Intervention.} Some commanders maintain control over a horde through arcane means, either with powerful enchantments or through conjured servants. An arcane commander's grasp can be shaken by use of magic-removal spells, or by inflicting an even more powerful enchantment upon the horde. Alternatively, an enchantment could be placed on the commander, thereby using the commander's influence to exert control the horde indirectly.": "{@b Arcane Intervention.}有些指挥官通过奥术手段来维持对部落的控制，要么是用强大的魔法，要么是通过召唤的仆人。通过使用消除魔法的咒语，或者对部落施加更强大的魔法，可以动摇一个奥术指挥官的控制权。另外，也可以在指挥官身上施加一个魔法，从而利用指挥官的影响力间接地控制部落。",

	"{@b Character Assassination.} For a commander that derives its authority through charisma, smears and denigration of the commander's character can be used to weaken its authority over a horde. Attempts to slander the commander's name will naturally not go unchallenged, and may result in a contested skill check involving a Charisma skill between the commander and slanderer. Depending on the horde's initial opinion of the commander, this check may be made at advantage on the commander's part, at disadvantage on the slanderer's part, or with both.": "{@b Character Assassination.}对于一个通过魅力获得权威的指挥官来说，对指挥官性格的诽谤和诋毁可以用来削弱其在部落中的权威。试图诽谤指挥官的名字，自然不会不受到质疑，可能会导致指挥官和诽谤者之间的技能检查竞争，涉及到魅力技能。根据部落对指挥官的最初看法，这个检查可能会在指挥官方面有优势，在诽谤者方面有劣势，或者两者都有。",
	"{@b Single Combat.} For a commander that derives its authority through combat prowess, a challenge of single combat may be sufficient to shake a horde's respect for its commander. In order to supplant a commander and take control of the horde, the commander must be bested in single combat.Certain hordes may specify certain sets of rules to be upheld, and may take deep offense to any violation of these rules.": "{@b Single Combat.}对于一个通过战斗力获得权威的指挥官来说，一次单挑就足以动摇一个部落对其指挥官的尊重。为了取代指挥官并控制部落，指挥官必须在单挑中被击败。某些部落可能会指定要遵守某些规则，并可能对任何违反这些规则的行为感到非常生气。",
	"Often, combat involving a large number of combatants can become messy, time consuming, and difficult to run and track. The rules for hordes established here serve to mitigate these issues, by grouping similar creatures into a single unit,allowing the DM to track fewer turns and pools of hit points.": "通常，涉及大量战斗人员的战斗会变得混乱、耗时，而且难以运行和追踪。这里建立的成群结队的规则有助于缓解这些问题，通过将类似的生物组合成一个单位，允许DM追踪更少的回合和命中率。",

	"The hordes presented here are meant to represent groups of identical creatures, working as a collective. As such, making a single horde represent a varied group of creatures can lead to complications. This is to maintain the mechanical simplicity of the horde, and to keep it simple for DMs to use.": "这里介绍的部落是为了代表相同的生物群体，作为一个集体工作。因此，让一个部落代表一组不同的生物会导致复杂化。这是为了保持部落在机械上的简单性，也是为了让DM使用它时保持简单。",
	"With careful consideration, this rule can be lifted, so long as the mechanical simplicity of the horde is maintained.": "只要仔细考虑，这个规则可以取消，只要保持部落的机械简单性就可以了。",
	"Not all creatures lend themselves well to working in groups.While a horde of berserkers may be able to rampage happily together, a group of spies would likely not function as well working as a horde as they would working as individuals.Thus, hordes should consist of creatures that benefit from working as a unit, and that have the capacity to do so.": "并非所有的生物都适合群体工作。虽然一群狂暴者可能能够一起快乐地横冲直撞，但一群间谍作为群体工作可能不如他们作为个人工作那么好。因此，群落应该由那些从作为一个单位工作中受益的生物组成，并且有能力这样做。",

	"A horde of Small or Medium creatures is sized asGargantuan, taking up a 20 foot by 20 foot area on a map.This size accommodates up to 16 Medium creatures, without overlap. Thus, hordes of Small or Medium creatures should represent no more than 16 individual creatures.": "一个小型或中型生物群的大小是巨大的，在地图上占据20英尺乘20英尺的区域。这个大小最多可以容纳16个中型生物，没有重叠。因此，小型或中型生物群应该代表不超过16个单独的生物。",
	"Creatures that are Large or larger are difficult to fit into hordes, and should be treated as individual combatants.Groups of Tiny creatures should be treated as swarms, not hordes. Examples of such swarms include swarm of rats,swarm of quippers, and swarm of insects, among others.": "大的或更大的生物很难被纳入成群结队的行列，而应该被当作单独的战斗人员对待。这种群落的例子包括老鼠群、奎尔人群和昆虫群，等等。",
	"Creatures with the ability to cast spells, either innately or through levels in a spellcasting class, should be treated as individual combatants. This is to maintain the limitations of spell slots, as spells can be extremely powerful tools that alter the face of the battlefield.": "具有施法能力的生物，无论是天生的还是通过法术类的等级，都应该被视为独立的战斗人员。这是为了保持法术槽的限制，因为法术可以成为改变战场面貌的极其强大的工具。",
	"With careful consideration, this rule can be lifted, so long as the spells and spell slots available to a horde of spellcasters are carefully selected.": "只要仔细考虑，这条规则是可以取消的，只要精心挑选出可供施法者部落使用的法术和法术槽就可以了。",

If the individual creatures in a horde originally had the Multiattack action, the horde does not gain the individual's Multiattack action.": "{@b Multiattack.}部落会进行四次攻击，如果部落有一半的命中率或更少，则会进行两次攻击。如果部落中的个别生物原本有多重攻击的动作，那么部落不会获得个别生物的多重攻击动作。",
	"Some hordes can get the following features as well.": "一些成群结队的人也可以获得以下功能。",
	"{@b Stampede.} When the horde moves through the space of a creature that is no more than one size larger than an individual member of the horde, it must succeed on aStrength saving throw or be knocked prone. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 8 + the horde's proficiency bonus +the horde's Strength modifier. For example, a horde ofMedium orcs can trample a Large dire wolf.": "{@b Stampede.}当角斗士穿过一个比角斗士个体大不超过一个体型的生物的空间时，它必须成功地进行力量救赎，否则会被击倒。这个蓄力动作的DC等于8+部落的熟练度加成+部落的力量修正值。例如，一个中级兽人部落可以踩死一只大型地狼。",
	"{@b Area of Effect Attack.} Each creature of the horde's choice within the horde's space, or within a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point within a ranged weapon's range, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage equal to 8 times an individual creature's weapon dice, or 4 times an individual creature's weapon dice if the horde has half its hit points or fewer. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 8 + the horde's weapon attack bonus.": "{@b Area of Effect Attack.}部落空间内，或以远程武器范围内的一个点为中心的10英尺半径范围内，每个部落选择的生物必须做一个灵巧的拯救动作。拯救失败时，生物会受到相当于单个生物的武器骰子8倍的伤害，如果部落的命中率为一半或更少，则为单个生物的武器骰子的4倍。拯救成功时，它将受到一半的伤害。这个救赎的DC等于8+角斗士的武器攻击奖励。",

	"Although hordes are immune to many conditions as a group,an effect that is capable of targeting the horde's entire space or of targeting a large number of creatures can suspend this.If the effect targets a large number of creatures (10creatures or more), the horde is required to be the only target of such an effect.
