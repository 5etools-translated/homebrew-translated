	"Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy.

	"Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it. But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to Pta'u to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied.

	"One of my first spells, and I believe still one of my best. Originally devised as a method to retrieve tea from my study without getting up, I've found that adjacent acquisition is more useful than it has any right to be.

If the target hits an object that is magical or not fragile—such as an immovable rod or a stone wall—the creature stops moving and takes {@damage 1d10} bludgeoning damage per 10 feet of movement left over, as the spell's magic repeatedly hammers the target against the object. If the creature hits another creature, both creatures take this damage and fall {@condition prone}.": "成功时，生物被推到一半的距离，但不会跌倒（%0%）。目标路径上脆弱的非魔法物体--如窗户或木椅--会被摧毁。如果目标击中一个有魔法的或不脆弱的物体--例如一个不可移动的棒子或石墙--生物就会停止移动，并且每10英尺的移动量会受到{@damage 1d10}的重击伤害，因为法术的魔法会反复地将目标锤击在物体上。如果该生物撞上另一个生物，两个生物都会受到这个伤害并跌倒（%2%）。",

	"For the duration, your eyes become pools of harsh yellow light. When a creature that can see your eyes starts its turn within 60 feet of you, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw as long as you can see the creature and aren't incapcitated.

	"If the illusion is a creature, it uses the statistics of an appropriate creature created or chosen by the GM. Creatures created by realize image act surprised by their own existence, have no allegiances, and are controlled by the GM. Sentient creatures created by this spell have personalities and memories, but the GM decides what they are.": "如果幻象是一种生物，它就会使用由GM创造或选择的适当生物的统计数据。由意识到的形象所创造的生物对自己的存在感到惊讶，没有效忠，并由GM控制。由这个咒语创造的有知觉的生物有个性和记忆，但由GM决定它们是什么。",

	"This spell makes illusions real. Not forever, mind you, but I can think of few things more dangerous than the imagination of an intrepid wizard imposing itself on reality, even if only temporarily.": "这个咒语使幻觉成为现实。注意，不是永远，但我能想到没有什么事情比一个无畏的巫师的想象力强加于现实更危险，即使只是暂时的。",
	"You create a shimmering dagger of force in your hand, which possesses the ability to attack magical sensors, such as those created by the {@spell scrying} and {@spell clairvoyance} spells.": "你在手中创造出一把闪闪发光的武力匕首，它拥有攻击魔法感应器的能力，例如由{@spell scrying}和{@spell clairvoyance}法术创造的感应器。",
	"When you cast the spell, you make one melee or ranged spell attack with the dagger, after which the dagger disappears. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 5d10} psychic damage.": "当你施法时，你用匕首进行一次近战或远程法术攻击，之后匕首就会消失。一旦命中，目标会受到{@damage 5d10}的精神伤害。",
	"You can also make this attack against a magical sensor you can see within range, which has AC 10. On a hit, the sensor is destroyed and the spell creating it immediately ends. The creature that created the destroyed sensor automatically takes maximum damage from scryspike.": "你也可以对范围内你能看到的魔法传感器进行这一攻击，该传感器的AC值为10。一旦命中，传感器就会被摧毁，创造它的法术也会立即结束。创造被摧毁的传感器的生物会自动受到scryspike的最大伤害。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@damage 1d10} for each slot level above 3rd.": "当你使用四级以上的法术槽施放此法术时，每超过三级的法术槽等级，伤害就会增加（%0%）。",
	"There is nothing quite like the neckprickling sensation of a scrying sensor watching over you. While magic exists to detect scrying—and even to prevent it in the first place—the scryed-upon ultimately has few options. Detecting a scrying sensor has little value; you do not learn who is watching you or why, only that you are not alone.": "没有什么比窥探感应器监视着你的脖子更让人感到刺痛的了。虽然有魔法可以探测到窥探，甚至可以在一开始就防止它，但被窥探的人最终没有什么选择。检测窥探传感器没有什么价值；你无法得知谁在监视你或为什么，只能知道你并不孤单。",
	"Hence I found this spell of particular interest. While fairly vindictive, it provides a nimble mage with the option to strike down a scrying sensor if they can see it. Breaking the connection is extremely disorientating for your unwelcome observer, and makes for rather effective deterrence. Furthermore, even though this spell was first designed to sever magical connections, it severs a creature's synapses pretty well too, making it a dangerous ace to keep up your sleeve.": "因此，我发现这个咒语特别有意义。虽然相当具有报复性，但它为敏捷的法师提供了一个选择，如果他们能看到探查传感器，就可以将其击倒。断开连接对你不受欢迎的观察者来说是非常迷惑的，而且能产生相当有效的威慑。此外，尽管这个咒语最初是为了切断魔法连接而设计的，但它也能很好地切断生物的突触，使它成为你袖子里的一张危险的王牌。",
	"You and your equipment vanish and melt into darkness, but your shadow remains on the ground with your consciousness in it. While shadowslipping, you gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, your AC becomes 20, you have 1 hit point, and you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You must be touching a surface at all times.": "你和你的装备消失并融化在黑暗中，但你的影子和你的意识仍留在地面上。在影子滑行时，你获得了+10的灵巧（（%0%））检查奖励，你在灵巧救赎上有优势，你的AC变为20，你有1个命中率，并且你获得了相当于你步行速度的爬升速度。你必须在任何时候都接触到一个表面。",
	"While shadowslipping, you can't speak aloud or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. You can't attack or cast spells. You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, and you treat liquids as if they were solid surfaces.": "在影子跳跃时，你不能大声说话或操纵物体，你所携带或持有的任何物体都不能被丢弃、使用或以其他方式进行互动。你不能攻击或施放法术。你可以穿过小孔、狭窄的开口，甚至是单纯的裂缝，而且你把液体当作固体表面。",
	"You can end the spell and revert to your normal form as an action, appearing where your shadow was.

This is similar to the way a wizard adds two spells to their spellbook whenever they gain a level for free, or how a ranger meets an animal companion after entering a specific subclass.

The curse can be broken by planting, growing, and harvesting root vegetable seeds that have been submerged in holy water or blessed by a cleric or paladin. If no undead have risen by the time the crops are harvested, the curse breaks. This process can be sped up through the use of spells such as {@spell druidcraft} or {@spell plant growth}.

A town affected by this curse has learned to speak in a dull monotone, lest their meaning be drowned out by the curse's influence. Because one must spend time focusing on not triggering the curse, Charisma checks made to communicate verbally with others in this area are made with disadvantage.": "但并非所有的音乐都是表演的。笑声、声音的转折、有节奏的话语重复--所有这些东西都有一种音乐，而诅咒将其转化为可怕的、可恶的噪音。受这种诅咒影响的城镇已经学会用沉闷的单音说话，以免他们的意思被诅咒的影响所淹没。因为人们必须花时间专注于不触发诅咒，所以在这个地区与他人进行口头交流时，魅力检查是以劣势进行的。",

	"This curse is all about presentation. Telling a player during a short rest, \"You notice a crow watching you\" might make them too suspicious too soon, especially if they've recently picked up a cursed item.

As more and more birds arrive, it gets harder to ignore, and you can make a point to remark upon them.": "这个诅咒是关于演示的。在短暂的休息中告诉玩家，\"你注意到一只乌鸦在看着你\"，可能会让他们过早地怀疑，特别是如果他们最近捡到了一个被诅咒的物品。一开始可以尝试将观察者纳入你的场景描述中：一只乌鸦栖息在岔路口的路标上，或者森林的树枝上充斥着黑鸟。随着越来越多的鸟儿到来，你就很难忽视它们，你可以对它们进行评论。",
	"The easiest way to be rid of the curse is to get rid of the item in question. Passing it off to someone else passes on the curse, but returning it to its resting place suppresses the curse. However, once returned to its resting place, one can permanently rid the item of the curse with a simple ritual familiar to many scholars of necromancy:": "摆脱诅咒的最简单方法是摆脱有关的物品。把它传给别人会传递诅咒，但把它放回原处会抑制诅咒。然而，一旦放回原处，人们可以通过许多死灵法术学者所熟悉的简单仪式永久地摆脱该物品的诅咒。",
	"Return to the final resting place of the cursed item's owner. Cast the {@spell speak with dead} spell on the owner's corpse and negotiate with it by making a DC 20 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. (You cannot intimidate the dead.) Per the rules of speak with dead, you may attempt this three times. On a success, the spirit agrees to pass on ownership of the item, and the curse is broken. On three consecutive failed saves, the vengeful spirit reanimates the body and attacks (use the ghoul stat block, or mummy or mummy lord at higher levels). Defeating this spirit breaks the curse permanently.": "回到被诅咒物品的主人的最后安息地。对物主的尸体施展（%0%）法术，并通过DC20的魅力（欺骗或说服）检查与之谈判。(你不能恐吓死者。）根据与死者交谈的规则，你可以尝试三次。如果成功，灵魂同意将物品的所有权传给你，并且诅咒被打破。在连续三次拯救失败的情况下，复仇的灵魂会使尸体复活并进行攻击（使用食尸鬼的状态块，或者在更高等级的木乃伊或木乃伊领主）。打败这个灵魂就能永久地打破诅咒。",
	"The term \"Slow Polymorph\" was coined by the sorcerer who first suffered its effects. Magic taxonomists, however, argue the curse has very little in common with the transmutation spell it was named for. Slow Polymorph slowly transforms its victim into a terrifying bestial or fiendish monster over a period of time until they are completely unrecognizable.": "慢速多态 \"这个词是由最早遭受其影响的巫师创造的。然而，魔法分类学家认为，这个诅咒与它所命名的转化法术没有什么共同之处。慢速多态术会在一段时间内将受害者慢慢转化为可怕的兽性或魔鬼般的怪物，直到他们完全无法辨认。",
	"Slow Polymorph is the punishment of choice for powerful wizards or otherworldly beings who prefer an impending sense of dread over just turning somebody into a toad. It requires an hourglass and something from the target's body: a lock of hair, a scrap of fingernail, or another such component. The ritual takes only 1 minute, wherein the caster binds the curse to the hourglass and then turns it over to reset the sand. As the sands slowly trickle down to the bottom, the cursed individual transforms.": "慢速多态是强大的巫师或其他世界的人选择的惩罚，他们更喜欢一种即将到来的恐惧感，而不是仅仅将某人变成一只蛤蟆。它需要一个沙漏和目标身体上的东西：一绺头发、一片指甲或其他类似的东西。仪式只需要1分钟，施法者将诅咒绑在沙漏上，然后将它翻转过来，重设沙子。当沙子慢慢流到底部时，被诅咒的人就会变身。",
	"When you complete a long or short rest while cursed, you must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you take on a new feature from one of the features below. This decision can be up to the GM, you, or a discussion between both.": "当你在被诅咒时完成一个长或短的休息，你必须做一个DC12的魅力拯救动作。如果救赎失败，你将从下面的特征中获得一个新的特征。这个决定可以由GM、你或者双方讨论来决定。",
	"{@b {@i Four-armed.}} You sprout an extra set of arms, with which you can hold one item, such as an arcane focus, light weapon, or shield. You can use a bonus action on your turn to make a melee attack with that light weapon, regardless of what action you take on that turn. The cost of armor for your new body is doubled.": "{@b {@i Four-armed.}}你多长出一双手臂，用它可以握住一件物品，如奥术焦点、轻型武器或盾牌。你可以在你的回合中使用一个额外行动，用那件轻型武器进行近战攻击，而不管你在该回合中采取什么行动。你的新身体的盔甲成本增加一倍。",
	"{@b {@i Four-legged.}} You sprout extra legs and become quadrupedal with a monster-shaped bottom and humanoid top. Your walking speed increases 10 feet, but the cost of clothing your new legs and feet is doubled.": "{@b {@i Four-legged.}}你长出额外的腿，成为四足动物，底部是怪物形状，顶部是人形。你的行走速度增加10英尺，但为你的新腿和新脚穿衣服的费用会增加一倍。",
	"{@b {@i Glowing Eyes.}} Your eyes take on a brilliant magical glow. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, or double the range of your darkvision if you already have it. Your magical glowing eyes emit dim light within 5 feet, cutting through even magical darkness.": "{@b {@i Glowing Eyes.}}你的眼睛会发出耀眼的魔法光芒。你获得60英尺范围内的暗视能力，如果你已经拥有暗视能力，则是其范围的两倍。你发光的眼睛在5英尺范围内发出昏暗的光，甚至可以穿透神奇的黑暗。",
	"{@b {@i Horns.}} You grow horns from your head, or your existing horns grow in size. When you move up to your speed on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make a melee attack with your horns. Strength is your ability for this unarmed strike, which deals {@damage 1d4} bludgeoning damage. Headgear made for humanoids no longer fits you, and you must spend an additional 20% on headgear for it to be tailored to your head.": "{@b {@i Horns.}} 你从你的头上长出角，或者你现有的角会变大。当你在你的回合中移动到你的速度时，你可以使用你的额外行动来用你的角进行一次近战攻击。力量是你这次徒手攻击的能力，造成{@damage 1d4}重击伤害。为人类制造的头饰不再适合你，你必须在头饰上花费额外的20%才能使其适合你的头部。",
	"{@b {@i Sharp Claws.}} With the addition of claws, your unarmed strike now deals {@damage 1d4} slashing damage. However, whenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, or make an ability check using tools, roll {@dice 1d4} and subtract the number rolled from the check.": "{@b {@i Sharp Claws.}}加上爪子，你的徒手攻击现在造成{@damage 1d4}的砍击伤害。然而，每当你进行灵巧（灵巧）检查，或使用工具进行能力检查时，要掷出{@dice 1d4}，并从检查中减去掷出的数字。",
	"{@b {@i Acidic Sweat.}} Your skin constantly oozes a mucus-y slime that lingers on surfaces you touch. The slime disintegrates organic material such as wood and plants if left in place for 1 hour, and deals {@damage 1d4} acid damage to creatures (except for you) who touch it. This includes creatures you hit with a melee weapon attack.": "{@b {@i Acidic Sweat.}}你的皮肤不断渗出粘液状的粘液，在你接触的表面上徘徊。这种粘液如果留在原地1小时，会瓦解木材和植物等有机材料，并对接触它的生物（除你之外）造成{@damage 1d4}的酸液伤害。这包括你用近战武器攻击击中的生物。",
	"{@b {@i Tough Skin.}} Your skin turns to bark or tough scales, giving you a +2 bonus to AC. Unfortunately, this new skin is difficult to move around in. Your Dexterity score is reduced by 2 while you are cursed.": "{@b {@i Tough Skin.}}你的皮肤会变成树皮或坚硬的鳞片,给你一个+2的交流奖励。不幸的是，这种新皮肤很难移动。在你被诅咒的时候，你的灵巧得分会减少2。",
	"{@b {@i Webbed Feet.}} You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Footwear made for most humanoid feet no longer fits you, and you must spend an additional 20% on footwear for it to be tailored to your new feet.": "{@b {@i Webbed Feet.}}你获得的游泳速度等同于你的步行速度。为大多数人形脚所做的鞋类不再适合你，你必须在鞋类上花费额外的20%，才能为你的新脚量身定做。",
	"Each time you gain a new feature, you must choose one you don't currently have. A single feature can be removed through the casting of the {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic, but you are still susceptible to future features until the curse itself is removed.": "每次你获得一个新特征时，你必须选择一个你目前没有的特征。一个单一的特征可以通过施放（%0%）咒语或类似的魔法来移除，但你仍然容易受到未来特征的影响，直到诅咒本身被移除。",
	"The more monstrous traits you select, the more likely people are inclined to believe you are a monster and be immediately afraid of or hostile toward you. A character with four arms, four legs, and glowing red eyes, for example, may be attacked on sight when they enter a town or city. The more monstrous you are, the more estranged from society you become.": "你选择的怪物特征越多，人们就越有可能认为你是一个怪物，并立即对你产生恐惧或敌意。例如，一个拥有四条胳膊、四条腿和发着红光的眼睛的角色，当他们进入一个城镇或城市时，可能会被当场攻击。你越是畸形，你就越是与社会疏远。",
	"Additionally, the more monster-like you become, the more monsters you attract. Whenever you roll initiative, there is a chance a nearby monstrosity senses your presence and considers it a threat. If you are the first or last person in the initiative order, a monster appears and joins the fray with the intent to attack you. Use the following chart to determine which monster arrives:": "此外，你变得越像怪物，你吸引的怪物就越多。每当你掷出主动权时，附近的怪物就有可能感觉到你的存在，并认为它是一种威胁。如果你是主动权顺序中的第一个或最后一个人，就会有一个怪物出现并加入战场，意图攻击你。使用下面的图表来决定哪个怪物会出现。",

Typically, the hourglasses are hidden or guarded with great care.": "施加诅咒的人也可以解除诅咒，但他们通常拒绝这样做，除非被诅咒的人已经做出了补偿。诅咒与用来施放它的沙漏结合在一起。打破沙漏可以解除诅咒，并对被诅咒者造成（%0%）的坏死伤害。通常情况下，沙漏会被隐藏起来或被小心翼翼地保护起来。",
	"What are Goldmongers? They are adventurers who, through divine guidance or primordial connection, find themselves at a nexus of power and material wealth. Tales of calculating merchant priests, divine mercenaries, and druids who draw their power from gems and gold traverse every corner of the realm. Greed does not generally make for good heroes...but it does make a good motivator. Whether they are defenders of the downtrodden or ambitious drifters, Goldmongers make close friends with avarice, whether to conquer or embrace it.": "什么是 \"金匠\"？他们是冒险家，通过神的指引或原始的联系，发现自己处于权力和物质财富的交汇处。关于精打细算的商人牧师、神圣的雇佣兵以及从宝石和黄金中汲取力量的德鲁伊的故事遍布王国的每个角落。贪婪一般不会成为好的英雄......但它确实是一个好的激励者。无论他们是受压迫者的捍卫者还是野心勃勃的漂泊者，黄金商人都与贪婪交上了朋友，无论是征服还是拥抱它。",
	"Those that walk these lucrative paths don't consider themselves baselessly greedy. They are cultured, ambitious, and dedicated to their ideals. Many monarchs rule by divine right, but Goldmongers know that the true divine power comes from deep vaults beneath the throne and, deeper still, from within the veins of the earth.": "那些走在这些有利可图的道路上的人不认为自己是无端的贪婪。他们有文化，有野心，并致力于他们的理想。许多君主通过神权进行统治，但金匠们知道，真正的神权来自王座下的深渊，更深的是来自地脉。",
	"This article presents a new deity of deals, three new subclasses for Goldmonger characters, and an avaricious NPC to insert into your narrative.": "本文介绍了一个新的交易神，三个新的金匠角色的子类，以及一个可以插入你的叙述中的贪婪的NPC。",
	"Divine practitioners of magic rarely choose to serve avarice. Obviously, if you serve, say, a prominent five-headed dragon queen, the application is obvious. But for many worshippers, avarice often comes from misinterpretation of the texts or tennents. When prosperity preachers finally realize what they've wrought, they're far too comfortable with or have fully extolled greed as virtue.": "神圣的魔法从业者很少选择为贪婪服务。很明显，如果你侍奉的是，比如说，一个突出的五头龙女王，那么应用就很明显了。但对许多崇拜者来说，贪婪往往来自对文本或天书的误解。当繁荣的传教士最终意识到他们所造成的后果时，他们对贪婪太舒服了，或者已经把贪婪完全颂扬为美德。",
	"Avarice commonly manifests in merchants or those that worship gods of trade, but it is hardly bound to commerce. Priests of the dead may insist on steep funeral costs, lest the fallen linger in this realm. A devout sailor may grip the oceans in terror, becoming a dread pirate lord upon discovering the riches gleaned off the backs of others—but their crew, their family, is the most well fed and paid on the high seas. A priest dedicated to a god of knowledge may hoard troves of texts until they pass, leaving a legendary library in their wake. There are even stories throughout the planes of a \"Church of Greed\"—a temple that worships no god in its pursuit of the divine, but rather the very concept of avarice itself.": "贪婪通常表现在商人或那些崇拜贸易之神的人身上，但它几乎与商业无关。死者的祭司可能坚持要求高昂的葬礼费用，以免堕落的人在这个领域里徘徊。虔诚的水手可能会在海洋中感到恐惧，在发现从别人身上搜刮来的财富后成为可怕的海盗头子--但他们的船员，他们的家人，是公海上吃得最饱、薪水最高的。献给知识之神的牧师可能会囤积成堆的文本，直到他们去世，在他们身后留下一个传奇的图书馆。甚至还有关于 \"贪婪教会 \"的故事--一个在追求神圣的过程中不崇拜任何神灵，而是崇拜贪婪这个概念本身的神庙。",
	"Not every cleric of avarice is \"evil,\" or even \"not very nice.\" Voracity can lead to ambition, which, with the right tempering, can become a form of highly directed altruism. Imagine the gnome friar who bestows daily blessings of fortune to the local miners, who in turn bring a small tithe at the end of the profitable day. Or the dwarven forge cleric who offers to consult priests of plenty in fine gem work in a mutually profitable relationship. Even the odd dungeon-crashing adventurer can transform their passion for stray animal adoption into a fully funded shelter for wayward monsters.": "并非每个贪婪的教士都是 \"邪恶的\"，甚至是 \"不怎么好的\"。贪婪可以导致野心，而野心在适当的调和下，可以成为一种高度定向的利他主义。想象一下，地精修士每天向当地的矿工赐予财富的祝福，而这些矿工则在盈利的一天结束时带来一小笔税金。或者，矮人的锻造教士提供给丰富的宝石工作的祭司咨询，这是一种互惠互利的关系。即使是古怪的地下城破坏者，也可以把他们对收养流浪动物的热情转化为对落单怪物的充分资助。",
	"There are many branching routes on the path of avarice, but those who walk it, whether by choice or circumstance, find that it is a difficult one to leave.": "贪婪的道路上有许多分支路线，但那些走过这条路的人，无论是出于选择还是环境，都发现这是一条难以离开的路。",

	"Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy. When he came of age and his parents decided to teach him how to manage the mines, he was initially horrified. They exploited their miners for little pay and forced them to work in dangerous conditions under strict contracts that prevented departure.Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it.": "他出生在拥有几个翡翠矿的富裕贵族家，在他的成长过程中，从来没有一刻感到缺乏或需要。他吹嘘自己在学院的时候，口袋里装着未切割的宝石走来走去。当他成年后，他的父母决定教他如何管理矿场时，他最初感到很震惊。他们剥削矿工，只给他们很少的报酬，强迫他们在危险的条件下工作，签订严格的合同，防止离开。当他意识到这种剥削是他致富的原因时......他拥抱了它。",
	"But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to Pta'u to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied. He convinced his workers that their labor in his service was a path to the divine. Their hard work, sweat, and tears would lead to countless rewards in the next life... and countless rewards in this life for Garin.": "但与他的父母不同，他们对硬资本的热情是世俗的，加林看着他的遗产，认为扩大、增长和消费是他对Pta'u的神圣职责。他永远不会满足。他使他的工人相信，他们为他服务的劳动是一条通向神圣的道路。他们的辛勤工作、汗水和泪水将导致来世的无数回报......以及加林在今生的无数回报。",
