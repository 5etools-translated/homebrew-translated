	"Whereas tourneys and contests of skill are grand public events and important occasions for nobility, wizarding contests are rarely met with much fanfare. Normally, they are held at lonely wizard's tower for a small audience of eclectic spellcasters, or at an arcane university to the cheers of students and faculty alike. Other times, they are played in secret, simply to prove a spellcaster's superiority over their peers.": "巡回赛和技能竞赛是盛大的公共活动，也是贵族的重要场合，而巫师竞赛却很少受到大肆宣传。通常情况下，他们会在孤独的巫师塔中为一小部分兼收并蓄的施法者观众举行，或者在一所神秘的大学中为学生和教师的欢呼而举行。其他时候，它们是秘密进行的，只是为了证明一个施法者比他们的同龄人更有优势。",
	"Wizarding contests are almost always used to prove the participant's mettle, by testing their wit, skill, and creativity -the attributes most important to spellcasting. In fact, they are routinely used as exams, a final test for apprentices, to be played against their masters.": "巫师比赛几乎总是用来证明参赛者的能力，通过测试他们的智慧、技能和创造力--对施法最重要的属性。事实上，它们经常被用作考试，是对学徒的最后测试，与他们的主人进行对决。",
	"Hedgemaze is game of problem solving and skill played by transmuters. The game takes place in a large, empty field, though a field flanked by hills is ideal for spectators. The two participants are traditionally called a Challenger and a Master, though other names are sometimes used, depending on the spellcasters' traditions. The Master uses transmutation magic to grow a maze of hedges (though mazes built of stone, corn, or other materials are not uncommon) in the field around the Challenger. The Master has only 1 minute to construct this maze, and the maze must be possible to solve. The Challenger has 10 minutes to escape the maze and win the game. Flying, or otherwise circumventing the walls of the Maze, or using divination magic to learn the Maze's shape is not allowed, and is grounds for the Challenger's disqualification.": "树篱迷宫是由转生者玩的解决问题和技巧的游戏。游戏在一个大的、空的场地上进行，虽然两边有山的场地对观众来说是理想的。两个参与者传统上被称为挑战者和大师，但有时也会使用其他名称，这取决于施法者的传统。主人用转化魔法在挑战者周围的田地里种出一个篱笆迷宫（虽然用石头、玉米或其他材料建造的迷宫也不罕见）。主人只有1分钟时间来建造这个迷宫，而且这个迷宫必须是可以解决的。挑战者有10分钟时间逃离迷宫并赢得比赛。不允许飞行，或以其他方式绕过迷宫的墙壁，或使用占卜魔法来了解迷宫的形状，这是挑战者被取消资格的理由。",
	"As the Challenger explores the Maze, only his starting location, the location of the exit, and intersections seen by him are known to him. On any of his turns, the Challenger can make a Intelligence check (DC equals to the Master's spell save DC) to gain some insight as to which direction might be fruitful (though the Challenger is not told by the DM if his roll succeeds or fails.)": "当挑战者在迷宫中探索时，只有他的起始位置、出口位置和他看到的交叉点是他知道的。在他的任何一个回合中，挑战者都可以进行智力检查（DC等于大师的法术保全DC），以获得一些关于哪个方向可能有结果的洞察力（尽管DM不会告诉挑战者他的卷轴是成功还是失败）。",
	"Additionally, most often, the Master is allowed to place one Minotaur at a predetermined point in the Maze (though the summoned monster is not always a minotaur, it is always dangerous and follows the commands of the master.) The Challenger is not allowed to kill the Minotaur; rather, he must use trickery, wit, and creativity to avoid the Minotaur and escape the Maze.": "此外，大多数情况下，主人被允许在迷宫的预定点放置一个牛头人（虽然召唤的怪物不一定是牛头人，但它总是很危险，并听从主人的命令）。挑战者不允许杀死牛头人；相反，他必须使用诡计、智慧和创造力来避开牛头人并逃离迷宫。",
	"The Illusionist's Ball is a deadly game of creativity and deception played between two or more spellcasters who favor illusion and enchantment magic. Usually, this game is played in secret. For each spellcaster that participates, three or more bystanders will also be involved in the game.": "幻术师之球是一个致命的创造力和欺骗的游戏，在两个或更多偏爱幻术和魔法的施法者之间进行。通常情况下，这个游戏是秘密进行的。每一个参与的施法者，三个或更多的旁观者也会参与到游戏中。",
	"The game takes place at a ball, or some other social gathering, such as a banquet, a dance, or a wedding. Each spellcaster must disguise themselves using illusion magic (the most common spell for this is disguise self) and also create an illusory person, called a Fake, to inhabit the ball. Illusory people are controlled by the DM, but their actions and response must be loosely dictated by the player that created them in advance. Each player is allowed five sentences of description for their illusory character.": "游戏发生在一个舞会上，或其他一些社交聚会，如宴会、舞会或婚礼上。每个施法者都必须使用幻觉魔法来伪装自己（最常见的咒语是伪装自己），同时创造一个虚幻的人，称为 \"假人\"，在舞会上居住。虚幻的人由DM控制，但他们的行动和反应必须由创造他们的玩家事先松散地支配。每个玩家可以为他们的虚幻人物描述五句话。",
	"The goal of game is to find and stealthily kill all of the other players' Fakes (a Fake vanishes upon death), while keeping your Fake undiscovered. Killing a bystander or a player is grounds for disqualification, as is using spells that detect the presence of illusions, such as detect magic or true seeing. Other magic, such as enchantment spells, are encouraged, and can be cast upon bystanders or other players to gain an edge in the game. Revealing that an Illusionist's Ball is taking place to a bystander is also grounds for disqualification.": "游戏的目标是找到并隐蔽地杀死所有其他玩家的假人（假人死后会消失），同时保持你的假人不被发现。杀害旁观者或玩家会被取消资格，使用检测幻象的法术也会被取消资格，如检测魔法或真视。其他魔法，如魔法咒语，是被鼓励的，可以对旁观者或其他玩家施放，以获得游戏中的优势。向旁观者透露正在举行的幻术舞会也是取消资格的理由。",
	"The immortal test of a spellcaster's might is the Spell Duel, a contest that directly pits the arcane power of two spellcasters against one another. Both spellcasters must have an arcane focus to participate in a spell duel. The duel happens in a continuous stream of arcane energy, but can be thought of by players as occurring in rounds.": "咒语决斗是对施法者力量的不朽考验，这是一场直接将两个施法者的奥术力量对立起来的竞赛。两个施法者都必须有一个奥术焦点才能参加法术决斗。决斗是在连续的奥术能量流中进行的，但玩家可以认为是分回合进行的。",
	"At the beginning of each round, each spellcaster expends one spell slot up their choice in secret. Each spellcaster then makes an ability check using their spellcasting ability, adding the spell slot's level to the roll, and adding their proficiency bonus if they are proficient with the Arcana skill. When a spellcaster loses this skill contest three times, their arcane focus breaks and they lose the duel.": "在每个回合开始时，每个施法者都要秘密地消耗一个他们选择的法术槽。然后每个施法者使用他们的施法能力进行能力检查，将法术槽的等级加入卷轴中，如果他们精通奥术技能，则加入他们的熟练度奖励。当一个施法者在这场技能竞赛中输掉三次时，他们的奥术焦点就会中断，并失去决斗。",
	"Alternatively, a spell duel can be a lethal contest, in which case the spellcasters eschew the use of arcane focuses and channel their arcane energy directly at one another. In this variation, when a spellcaster loses the skill contest, they take 1d6 force damage for every level of the slot expended by their opponent.": "另外，法术决斗也可以是一场致命的竞赛，在这种情况下，施法者放弃使用奥术焦点，直接向对方输送奥术能量。在这种变化中，当施法者在技能竞赛中失败时，他们会因对手消耗的每一级槽而受到1d6的力量伤害。",
	"Above all else, Summoner's Chess is a two-spellcaster game of strategy. This game takes place on a large 40-foot by 40-foot board, whose 5-foot by 5-foot tiles alternate between white and black -- essentially a massive chess board, though some summoners use hexagonal variants on the board. Each spellcaster can summon monsters to occupy the 15 nearest tiles on their side of the board (for non-standard boards, this number is always one less than one fourth the total number of tiles.) The most popular spells used for this task are conjure animals, conjure woodland beings, find familiar, and occasionally conjure minor elementals, though very powerful spellcasters might cast conjure celestial or conjure elemental once each. Each spellcaster can concentrate on more than one conjuration spell for the duration of the game (making only a single Constitution check for all their spells to maintain concentration), but these spells immediately end when the game is complete.": "最重要的是，召唤师之棋是一种双施法者的策略游戏。这个游戏发生在一个40英尺×40英尺的大棋盘上，其5英尺×5英尺的牌在白色和黑色之间交替出现--本质上是一个巨大的国际象棋棋盘，尽管有些召唤师在棋盘上使用六边形的变体。每个施法者都可以召唤怪物来占据棋盘上离自己最近的15张牌（对于非标准棋盘，这个数字总是比总牌数的四分之一少一个）。这个任务最常用的法术是召唤动物、召唤林地生物、寻找熟人，偶尔也会召唤小元素，不过非常强大的施法者可能会分别施展一次召唤天体或召唤元素。在游戏期间，每个施法者都可以专注于一个以上的魔法咒语（对他们所有的咒语只做一次宪法检查以保持专注），但这些咒语在游戏结束时立即结束。",
	"Once each spellcaster has populated their side of the board, they also take a place on the board. The objective of the game is to harry the opposing spellcaster to lose concentration on their spells. If a spellcaster loses concentration on their spells, they lose the game.": "一旦每个施法者在棋盘上填满了自己的一方，他们也会在棋盘上占一个位置。游戏的目的是骚扰对方的施法者，使其失去对法术的注意力。如果一个施法者失去了对其法术的注意力，他们就会输掉比赛。",
	"Spellcasters take turns commanding their summons to move around the board. On each turn, a spellcaster can only move one summoned creature and command it to take an action. Many spellcasters play with a variation allowing a player to command 2 summoned creatures of CR 1/2 or lower or 3 summoned creatures of CR 1/4 or lower on a single turn. Each creature can only occupy one space and can attack opposed creatures on adjacent spaces, regardless of its size. A spellcaster can't cast any spells once the game has begun.": "施法者轮流指挥他们的召唤物在棋盘上移动。在每个回合中，施法者只能移动一个召唤物，并命令它采取一个行动。许多施法者使用一种变体，允许玩家在一个回合内指挥2个CR 1/2或更低的召唤生物或3个CR 1/4或更低的召唤生物。每个生物只能占据一个空间，并且可以攻击相邻空间的敌对生物，无论其大小如何。一旦游戏开始，施法者就不能施放任何法术。",
	"Some spellcasters (especially warmages) play with fairly sophisticated rules for this game, such as implementing rules for Castling and en passant, but these are not standard.": "一些施法者（尤其是暖男）在这个游戏中使用了相当复杂的规则，比如执行城堡和通行的规则，但这些都不是标准规则。"
