	"A castle on a wind-swept cliff, overlooking a verdant bone-strewn valley where an ancient battle took place. Set against the seaside, an open-air ivory-columned temple spreads its arms wide to welcome in the elements. At a dusty crossroads, a lone trading post invites all travelers, specially those with purses filled with gold, or lips laden with rumors.": "一座位于风中的悬崖上的城堡，俯瞰着发生过一场古代战争的青翠的白骨谷。在海边，一座露天的象牙柱寺庙张开双臂，欢迎各种元素的到来。在一个尘土飞扬的十字路口，一个孤独的贸易站邀请所有的旅行者，特别是那些钱包里装满黄金，或者嘴里满是谣言的人。",
	"As storied as these locations may be, they were all founded at one point by historical figures. Bold, noteworthy folk of many walks of life, who invested coin and manpower into building these landmarks for purposes inscrutable, either lost to the passage of time or handed down in song and story between the generations. Immortality is available to all adventurers with sufficient coin, should they wish to build it.": "尽管这些地方可能很有故事，但它们都曾由历史人物建立过。大胆的、值得注意的各行各业的人，他们投入硬币和人力来建造这些地标，其目的难以捉摸，要么被时间的流逝所淹没，要么在歌曲和故事中世代相传。所有拥有足够硬币的冒险者都可以获得不朽之身，如果他们想建造它的话。",
	"Players often wish to leave their mark on the world, to establish something grand that can survive their characters and change the world around them, making it altogether better, worse, or simply different for its presence. Structures that are created by the characters are an excellent opportunity for roleplaying, quests, and story, being an instantly visible and prominent part of the world to those in regions nearby.": "玩家通常希望在这个世界上留下自己的印记，建立一些宏伟的东西，使他们的角色能够生存下去，并改变他们周围的世界，使它变得更好、更坏，或者仅仅是因其存在而不同。角色创造的建筑是角色扮演、任务和故事的绝佳机会，对于附近地区的人来说，它是世界上立即可见和突出的部分。",
	"A structure included in a game is typically both a focal point of the campaign and an investment opportunity for the player characters. The more gold and time characters spend expanding, improving, and staffing their structure, the more benefits, defense, and utility it provides. A well-governed structure can act as a military bastion, a powerful trading hub, ir the spiritual center of a faith, and those that control the structure may stand as the stewards of the fates of millions.": "游戏中的结构通常既是活动的焦点，也是玩家角色的投资机会。角色花的金币和时间越多，扩建、改进和配置他们的结构，它提供的好处、防御和效用就越多。一个管理良好的结构可以作为一个军事堡垒，一个强大的贸易中心，一个信仰的精神中心，而那些控制结构的人可能会成为数百万人命运的管家。",
	"Should players wish to build a structure, they must pay the associated construction fee and invest the proper construction time to build it, as indicated on the Buildable Structures table. If this structure will be on owned land in a kingdom or other governed region, players must typically buy the land to be allowed to build by the government, at a price determined by its size and location. The price of land typically runs between 100 gp and 1000 gp for a small to well-sized plot, but can stretch upwards of 5,000 gp for a large, expansive plot. The DM determines land prices, and not all land is inherently for sale.": "如果玩家想建造一个结构，他们必须支付相关的建造费，并投入适当的建造时间来建造它，如可建造的结构表上所示。如果这个建筑是在王国或其他管辖区域的自有土地上，玩家通常必须购买土地，以获得政府的允许，价格由其大小和位置决定。土地的价格通常在100金币到1000金币之间，对于一块大小适中的土地来说，但对于一块大的、广阔的土地来说，价格可能超过5000金币。DM决定了土地价格，而且并非所有的土地都是固有的出售品。",
	"The cost of construction includes materials and labor, and players need not be present during construction. Ifa character is present and contributes to labor each for the entire duration of the construction time, you may reduce the structure's total cost by a percentage equal to half the character's level, rounded up. Multiple characters may work on a structure for its entire construction time in this way to secure this benefit multiple times.": "建筑物的成本包括材料和劳动力，玩家不需要在施工期间在场。如果一个角色在场，并在整个建造时间内为每个人提供劳动，你可以将该建筑的总成本降低一个百分比，相当于该角色等级的一半，四舍五入。多个角色可以在一个建筑的整个施工时间内以这种方式工作，以确保多次获得这种好处。",
	"The Skilled and Unskilled Hirelings columns indicate how many hirelings the structure and its expansions re- quire to function (see the {@book Hirelings, Soldiers, & Casters} section later on for more). For the purposes of this chart, soldiers and spellcasters qualify as skilled hirelings.": "熟练和非熟练雇佣者一栏表明了该结构及其扩展需要多少雇佣者来运作（更多内容请见后面的（%0%）部分）。在本图表中，士兵和施法者被视为熟练雇佣者。",

	"You may also rebuild a damaged structure you happen upon, should the DM determine you can make a legitimate claim to its ownership. You do not have to pay full price for such a structure and may not necessarily have to purchase the land this structure is on. The construction time and cost of a damaged structure varies directly with the amount of damage the structure has taken. As an example, if a structure is only 25% damaged, repairing the structure and rendering it active would require 25% of the normal construction cost and time. Examples of what specific percentages of damage would look like may be found on the following table.": "你也可以重建你碰巧遇到的受损结构，如果管理部确定你可以对其所有权提出合法要求。你不必为这种结构支付全价，也不一定要购买这种结构所在的土地。受损结构的施工时间和成本直接取决于该结构所受的损害程度。举例来说，如果一个结构只损坏了25%，修复该结构并使其恢复使用，需要25%的正常建筑成本和时间。损坏的具体百分比的例子可以在下表中找到。",

More than one character may secure this benefit for one room at the same time. Work may be done to furnish multiple rooms at the same time, but laboring characters may only gain a discount on one of them.": "和建筑本身一样，在房间装修的时候，人物不需要在场，但是如果他们在一个房间的整个施工时间内都在场并进行劳动，他们可能会减少房间的总成本，百分比相当于人物等级的一半，四舍五入。一个以上的人物可以同时为一个房间获得这种好处。可以同时为多个房间进行装修工作，但劳动者只能在其中一个房间获得折扣。",

Likewise, a setting without clockwork could find it difficult to justify the inclusion of a clock tower.": "有些布置房间的方法会产生比其他方法更奇特的结果，而且不是所有的房间都适合于每个游戏。例如，你的管理员可能会规定，在一个没有航空旅行的环境中，建造一个航空码头是不可能的或不切实际的。同样地，一个没有钟表的环境可能会发现很难证明包含一个钟楼。",
