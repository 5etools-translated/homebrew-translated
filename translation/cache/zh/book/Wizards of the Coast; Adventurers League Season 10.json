You can rebuild your character prior to playing their first adventure at 5th-level—changing any of your character's statistics while abiding the current season's house rules. Non-mechanical aspects of your character such as alignment, gender, name, choice of deity, or personality traits can be changed between sessions regardless of level.": "{@b Character Rebuilding}. 你可以在5级的时候重建你的角色，改变你的角色的任何统计数据，同时遵守当前季节的内部规则。你的角色的非机械方面，如排列、性别、名字、神灵的选择或个性特征，可以在两次会议之间改变，而不考虑等级。",
	"Your character keeps any rewards and equipment earned to that point. If your character's class or background changes, they lose any equipment that it granted, along with the proceeds from selling it, or benefits derived from it, such as copied spells or gold earned by selling it. Similarly, if you change their faction, access to renown benefits are suspended (see Appendix 1: Renown). Dead characters or those removed from play can't be rebuilt, nor can story awards be exchanged or removed.": "你的角色保留到那时为止获得的任何奖励和装备。如果你的角色的等级或背景改变了，他们就会失去它所授予的任何装备，以及出售它的收益，或从它获得的好处，如复制的法术或出售它所获得的金币。同样地，如果你改变了他们的派别，对名声利益的获取也会暂停（见附录1：名声）。死亡的角色或从游戏中删除的角色不能重建，故事奖励也不能被交换或删除。",
	"{@b Death, Disease, and Curses}. Dead characters or those subject to a condition or story award that  removes them from play (vampirism, lycanthropy, petrification, imprisoned in another plane, etc.) can't begin a new session until they've been returned to life or until relieved of the effects that removed them from play—something that NPC Spellcasting Services can typically accomplish with a nominal gp cost. If your character doesn't have enough gold to pay for the cost of the requisite service or if they suffer from any effect that spellcasting services can't remove (such as a story award requiring a wish), you can instead choose to remove a permanent magic item (excluding common magic items) in order to return the character to life or to remove all effects that removed them from play. A character returned to play in this way also finds their Magic Item Limit reduced by 1 until they reach the next tier of play (or completed two adventures or hardcover chapters at 20th level).": "{@b Death, Disease, and Curses}. 死去的角色或那些受条件或故事奖励影响而退出游戏的角色（吸血鬼、狼人、石化、被囚禁在另一个位面等）不能开始新的会话，直到他们恢复生命或解除使他们退出游戏的影响--这一点NPC施法服务通常只需花费象征性的金币就可以完成。如果你的角色没有足够的金币来支付必要的服务费用，或者如果他们遭受了咒语服务无法消除的任何影响（比如需要许愿的故事奖），你可以选择移除一个永久魔法物品（不包括普通魔法物品），以使角色恢复生命或解除使他们离开游戏的所有影响。以这种方式返回游戏的角色也会发现他们的魔法物品限制减少了1，直到他们达到下一个游戏层级（或在20级时完成两个冒险或精装章节）。",
	"This option is always available—even if a character's Magic Item Limit has been reduced to 0 or if they have no magic items.": "这个选项总是可用的--即使一个角色的魔法物品限制已经减少到0或者他们没有魔法物品。",
	"{@b Breaking From Seasonal Play}. Once your character has reached 5th level (Tier 2) you can migrate them to play in content specific to the Dreams of the Red Wizards story arc. Additionally, your character can play any of the content from seasons prior to season 10. If you migrate your character, they may no longer play in the current season's content.": "{@b Breaking From Seasonal Play}. 一旦你的角色达到5级（2级），你可以将他们迁移到《红袍巫师之梦》故事弧的特定内容中玩。此外，你的角色可以玩第十季之前的任何一季内容。如果你迁移了你的角色，他们可能不再玩当前季节的内容。",

	"Between sessions, your character can sell or buy equipment and spell components using the rules found in the PH. Additional options might be made available at the end of any given adventure. Sometimes, equipment might be hard to find during an adventure and unavailable for you to buy. Your DM will tell when this is the case. Gold earned from selling items counts against your GP Limit.": "在两次会议之间，你的角色可以使用PH中的规则出售或购买装备和法术组件。额外的选择可能会在任何特定的冒险结束时提供。有时，装备可能在冒险过程中很难找到，你无法购买。你的管理员会告诉你什么时候是这种情况。出售物品所赚取的金币可计入你的GP限制。",

	"Between adventures you can use the downtime activities found in the PH as well as the following activities. Lifestyle costs aren't incurred when spending downtime days.": "在冒险之间，你可以使用在PH中发现的停工期活动，以及以下活动。闲暇时的生活费用不会产生。",
	"{@b Downtime: Spellcasting Services}. You can spend a downtime day to have an NPC cast one spell for you. Alternatively, you can use this downtime activity to cast one spell yourself or benefit from a spell cast by another character that is at the same table as you without expending spell slots or renewable charges from magic items. The DM alone has ultimate discretion on whether use of downtime is feasible during the session (i.e., there are multiple days of inactivity that make it an option).": "{@b Downtime: Spellcasting Services}. 你可以花一个停工日，让一个NPC为你施展一个法术。或者，你可以利用这个停工期活动自己施展一个法术，或者从与你同桌的另一个角色施展的法术中获益，而不需要消耗法术槽或魔法物品的可再生费用。只有DM有最终的决定权，决定在会议期间使用停工期是否可行（即有多天不活动，使其成为一种选择）。",
	"{@b Downtime: Catching Up}. By spending downtime at 4th, 10th, or 16th level you gain a level.": "{@b Downtime: Catching Up}. 通过在4级、10级或16级花费停机时间，你获得一个等级。",
	"{@b Downtime: Copying Spells}. Characters copying spells into a spellbook must use this downtime activity. You spend up to 8 hours copying spells into your spellbook and/or making their spellbook available for other characters to copy from for each downtime day you spend. Characters playing at the same table together can \"trade\" spells with each other using this activity. Each wizard has their own \"language\" used for scribing spells and can't benefit from the Help action when scribing—even if assisted by other wizards. You must use this downtime activity if you wish to copy spells into a spellbook or to make your own spells available for someone else to copy. This downtime activity must be used in the presence of your table's DM.": "{@b Downtime: Copying Spells}. 将法术复制到魔法书中的角色必须使用这个停工期活动。你每花一天的停工时间，最多花费8小时将法术复制到你的法术书中，和/或使他们的法术书可供其他角色复制。在同一张桌子上一起玩的角色可以用这个活动互相 \"交换 \"法术。每个巫师都有自己的 \"语言 \"用于抄写法术，并且在抄写时不能受益于 \"帮助 \"行动--即使有其他巫师的帮助。如果你想将法术复制到法术书中，或将你自己的法术提供给其他人复制，你必须使用这个停工活动。这个停工活动必须在你桌子的管理员在场的情况下使用。",
	"{@b Downtime: Trading Magic Items}. Permanent magic items can be traded on a one-for-one basis for items of the same rarity. Only tier 4 characters can trade legendary items. Each party to the trade must spend 15 downtime days unless they're playing at the same table. Certificates (if present) must accompany the trade or be destroyed. Unique magic items or magic items without magical properties can't be traded. If your magic item possesses a certificate, it must accompany the trade or be destroyed. In the event of conflict, the Dungeon Master's Guide determines an item's rarity and properties.": "{@b Downtime: Trading Magic Items}. 永久魔法物品可以在一比一的基础上与相同稀有度的物品进行交易。只有第4级角色可以交易传奇物品。交易的每一方都必须花费15天的停工期，除非他们在同一张桌子上玩。证书（如果存在）必须伴随交易，否则将被销毁。独特的魔法物品或没有魔法属性的魔法物品不能被交易。如果你的魔法物品拥有证书，它必须伴随交易，否则将被销毁。在发生冲突的情况下，《地下城主指南》会决定物品的稀有性和属性。",

	"{@b Scribing Scrolls (XGE)}. You don't suffer complications while using this activity.": "{@b Scribing Scrolls (XGE)}. 在使用这项活动时，你不会遭受并发症。",
	"By adventuring, your character establishes themselves as notable among the denizens of Faerûn. As their reputation grows, they can call in favors from those they have crossed paths with along their journeys. Additional information on renown can be found in appendix 1.": "通过冒险，你的角色在Faerûn的居民中建立了自己的知名度。随着他们的名声越来越大，他们可以从那些在旅途中与他们有交集的人那里获得恩惠。关于名声的其他信息可以在附录1中找到。",

	"{@b Faction Insignia}. Members of a faction receive an identifying insignia of their faction: a pin, a brassard, or special coin. In addition, they can also identify themselves in other ways, such as clothing, tattoos, or secret handshakes. Upon reaching 5th level, faction members receive a magical signet ring (see appendix 2: Renown)": "{@b Faction Insignia}. 一个派别的成员会收到他们派别的识别标志：别针、铜牌或特殊硬币。此外，他们还可以通过其他方式来识别自己，比如衣服、纹身或秘密握手。在达到5级时，派系成员会得到一个神奇的标志戒指（见附录2：名声）。",
	"As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.": "作为一个派别的特工，你可以接触到一个由支持者和特工组成的秘密网络，他们可以在你的冒险中提供帮助。你知道一套秘密的标志和密码，你可以用来识别这些特工，他们可以为你提供进入隐藏的安全屋、免费的房间和膳宿，或者帮助你寻找信息。这些特工从不为你冒生命危险，也不冒险暴露他们的真实身份。",
	"At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your character, including ability scores, race, class, and background. Together these elements help paint a picture of your character's origin and give you the ability to create many different types of characters. Despite that versatility, a typical character race in D&D includes little or no choice—a lack that can make it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lack by adding choice to your character's race, allowing you to customize your ability scores, languages, and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have in mind for your character. Character race in the game represents your character's fantasy species, combined with certain cultural assumptions. The following options step outside those assumptions to pave the way for truly unique characters.": "在1级时，你可以选择你的角色的各个方面，包括能力分数、种族、等级和背景。这些元素共同帮助描绘了你的角色的起源，并使你有能力创造许多不同类型的角色。尽管有这种多功能性，但D&D中典型的角色种族几乎没有选择，这种缺乏会使某些角色概念难以实现。下面的小节通过为你的角色种族增加选择权来解决这个问题，允许你自定义你的能力分数、语言和某些能力，以适应你对角色的想法。游戏中的角色种族代表你的角色的幻想物种，与某些文化假设相结合。以下选项跳出了这些假设，为真正独特的角色铺平了道路。",
	"Whatever D&D race you choose for your character, you get a trait called Ability Score Increase. This increase reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For example, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the archetype.": "无论你为你的角色选择什么样的D&D种族，你都会得到一个叫做能力得分增加的特性。这种增加反映了D&D过去这类冒险家的一点典型的卓越表现。例如，如果你是一个矮人，你的体质会增加2，因为D&D中的矮人英雄通常都是非常强悍的。这种增加并不适用于每个矮人，只适用于矮人冒险者，它的存在是为了加强一种原型。如果你想向原型靠拢，这种强化是合适的，但如果你的角色不符合原型，它就没有帮助了。",
	"If you'd like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can't apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can't increase a score above 20.": "如果你想让你的角色走自己的路，你可以忽略你的能力分值增加特性，为你的角色量身定做能力分值增加。具体做法是：将你在你的种族或次种族中获得的任何能力分值增加，应用于你选择的能力分值。如果你获得了一个以上的提高，你不能将这些提高应用于同一个能力分数上，而且你不能将一个分数提高到20以上。",
	"For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.": "例如，如果你的种族或亚种族的能力得分增加特性使你的体质增加2，智慧增加1，你可以使你的智力增加2，魅力增加1。",
	"Your character's race includes languages that your character is assumed to know, usually Common and the language of your ancestors. For example, a halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common and Halfling. Here's the thing: D&D adventurers are extraordinary, and your character might have grown up speaking languages different from the ones in your Languages trait.": "你的角色的种族包括你的角色被认为会的语言，通常是普通话和你祖先的语言。例如，一个半身人冒险家被假定为懂得普通话和半身人。问题是：D&D的冒险家是非同寻常的，你的角色可能在成长过程中讲的语言与你的语言特征中的语言不同。",
	"To customize the languages you know, you may replace each language in your Languages trait with a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.": "要自定义你所知道的语言，你可以从以下列表中用一种语言替换你语言特质中的每一种语言。Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.",
	"Your DM may add or remove languages from that list, depending on what languages are appropriate for your campaign.": "你的DM可以从该列表中添加或删除语言，这取决于哪些语言适合你的活动。",
