	"Is it the destination or the journey that's more important? On the Rail-Away, the industrial crew have decided to offer both! This traveling tavern's tracks can run through any number of locations to suit your campaign—above ground and below, between cities and towns, through the countryside, over the mountains, or along the coast. The track can be circular for an infinite loop to bring you back to where you started, or an end-to-end journey with adventure along the way. As a variant way to play using this book, the Rail-Away can serve as a cruise vessel that visits all the other taverns in order.": "到底是目的地还是旅程更重要？在Rail-Away上，工业团队决定同时提供这两样东西! 这个旅行酒馆的轨道可以穿过任何数量的地点，以适应你的运动--在地面和地下，在城市和城镇之间，穿过乡村，越过山脉，或沿着海岸。轨道可以是环形的，以实现无限循环，使你回到开始的地方，也可以是端到端的旅程，沿途进行冒险。作为使用本书的另一种玩法，\"铁路之路 \"可以作为一艘游船，依次访问所有其他酒馆。",
	"The adventures found on the Rail-Away are intended for characters level 5 to 10. The tavern can be played as a temporary location, serving as a respite from dangerous adventures. Alternatively, you can play through its combination of quests and a murder mystery event using the NPCs provided.": "在 \"铁路之路 \"上发现的冒险是为5到10级的角色准备的。酒馆可以作为一个临时地点来玩，作为危险冒险的喘息之地。另外，你也可以通过它的任务组合和使用所提供的NPC的谋杀之谜事件来玩。",
	"While how frequently the Rail-Away stops at stations is at the GM's discretion, some quests require at least a day of travel time between stops to allow player characters time to adventure. Stops can also be instigated by refueling, passenger transitions, or the addition of cargo carts.": "虽然Rail-Away在车站停靠的频率由总经理决定，但有些任务要求在两站之间至少有一天的旅行时间，以使玩家角色有时间进行冒险。停站也可以通过加油、乘客转换或增加货运车来促成。",
	"The Rail-Away carriages are connected in the order listed, but additional cars can be added as necessary at the GM's discretion. Unless otherwise noted, each train carriage has a small platform on either end to facilitate moving between the cars while the train is in motion, as well as a ladder to provide access to the top of the train.": "铁道部的车厢是按照列出的顺序连接的，但也可以根据需要由总经理决定添加额外的车厢。除非另有说明，每节车厢的两端都有一个小平台，以方便列车行驶时在车厢之间移动，还有一个梯子，以提供通往列车顶部的通道。",
	"The party can board the Rail-Away from their departing station onto any sleeper or amenities car, with or without a ticket, as Prim the Ticketmaster will be moving through the cars after departure. Anyone who has traveled the train before knows not to be caught out without buying a ticket. If the party attempts to do so, they will quickly learn Prim's nickname (see the Tavern's Operators), and be kicked off the train.": "一行人可以从出发的车站登上Rail-Away，上任何一节卧铺或便利设施车厢，无论是否有票，因为Prim的售票员会在出发后在车厢内穿梭。任何曾经乘坐过火车的人都知道，不要在没有买票的情况下被抓出来。如果一行人试图这样做，他们会很快知道普里姆的绰号（见酒馆经营者），并被踢下火车。",
	"{@b {@i Note.}} Squares are actually 2.5' not 5'. GMs using minis are recommended to treat the squares as if they were 5', and ignore any combat restrictions this size would impose.": "{@b {@i Note.}}方块实际上是2.5英尺而不是5英尺。建议使用迷你模型的GM将这些方块视为5英尺，并忽略这个尺寸带来的任何战斗限制。",
	"The Rail-Away's engine is a technological marvel for the ages, with two towering smokestacks that never seem to stop puffing away. Both the interior and exterior are a mixture of gleaming black iron, silver pipes, and brass fixtures with some painted accents of red and gold. A cow-catcher grille on the front has saved the train more than once from derailing, though only once was the creature it pushed out of the way an actual cow.": "Rail-Away的发动机是一个古老的技术奇迹，有两个高耸的烟囱，似乎永远不会停止喷烟。内部和外部都是由闪闪发光的黑铁、银色的管道和黄铜装置组成，并有一些红色和金色的油漆点缀。车头的捕牛栅栏不止一次地挽救了火车出轨，尽管只有一次它推开的是一头真正的牛。",
	"Only the back half of the engine room is accessible by normal humanoids. The round hatch inset in the middle leads to the engine itself, which is powered by a fire elemental and a number of steam mephits, all controlled by the engineer, Brandr Fintan.": "只有引擎室的后半部分可以让正常的人类进入。中间镶嵌的圆形舱门通向发动机本身，它由一个火元素和一些蒸汽梅菲特提供动力，全部由工程师布兰特-芬丹控制。",
	"This multi-purpose carriage is one of the smaller of the Rail-Away's cars but serves three purposes: an area for livestock such as guest's mounts, a cargo bay for supplies and larger guest items that won't fit into their room, and a small bedroom with a private washroom for the engineer. While the outside of the carriage is of the same standard as the rest of the train, the inside is bare bones and undecorated. The floors are all plain wood, and some areas are noticeably damaged by the livestock's \"proceedings.\" There are no windows, except on the door to the engineer's room that leads to the engine. There are working lights in the livestock area, but the cargo bay has no built-in lighting.": "这节多功能车厢是Rail-Away列车中较小的一节车厢，但有三个用途：客人坐骑等牲畜的区域，放置用品和无法放入房间的较大客人物品的货舱，以及为工程师准备的带有私人盥洗室的小卧室。虽然车厢外面的标准与列车的其他部分相同，但里面却是光秃秃的，没有任何装饰。地板都是普通的木头，有些地方被牲畜的 \"诉讼 \"明显损坏。除了通向发动机的工程师室的门上没有窗户。牲畜区有工作灯，但货舱没有内置照明。",
	"The engineer's room is spartan, containing only a double bed, a locked chest, a wardrobe, and a writing desk. A small stack of books and ledgers are piled on the desk, but they are covered in a fine layer of dust. The only concession to comfort is that the bathroom includes a claw foot bathtub and an extensive collection of scented soaps, quick-foaming bubble bath, and essential oils.": "工程师的房间很简陋，只有一张双人床、一个上锁的箱子、一个衣柜和一张写字台。书桌上堆放着一小堆书和账簿，但它们都被一层细小的灰尘所覆盖。唯一让人感到舒适的是，浴室里有一个爪足浴缸和大量的香皂、快速起泡的泡泡浴和精油。",
	"If Lord Gammon is aboard, a large locked chest belonging to him will be located in the cargo bay. It contains 2,000 gold, five diamonds (worth 75 gold each), a supply of fine clothing, and a {@b coded ledger} that details Lord Gammon's illegal business dealings. It is a simple \"Caesar Shift\" code utilising Undercommon and Thieves' Cant, and can be cracked with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Anyone with knowledge of Thieves' Cant has advantage on the check. The most repeated code in the ledgers is \"Bpm Svqnm.\"": "如果金门勋爵在船上，货舱里会有一个属于他的上锁的大箱子。里面有2000金币、五颗钻石（每颗价值75金币）、一批精美的衣服，以及一份详细记录了金门勋爵非法商业交易的（%0%）。这是一个简单的 \"凯撒移位 \"密码，利用了地下水和盗贼的语言，可以通过DC16情报（调查）检查来破解。任何有 \"盗贼之语 \"知识的人在检查中都有优势。账簿中重复最多的代码是 \"Bpm Svqnm\"。",
	"The Staff Sleeper Car outwardly appears the same as the rest of the Rail-Away's carriages, but the interior has significantly simpler (though still comfortable) decorations and furnishings. Rather than keeping with the opulent tones of the other interiors, the colors here are more muted and earthy to save on upkeep expenses.": "职员卧铺车厢的外观与Rail-Away的其他车厢相同，但内部的装饰和家具明显更简单（尽管仍然很舒适）。这里的颜色没有保持其他内饰的华丽色调，而是更加柔和朴实，以节省维护费用。",
	"There are two bathrooms on either end of the carriage, with a toilet, sink, and shower for staff use. There are five bedrooms, each containing four twin-size beds (stacked like bunk beds), a chair, a chest, and two small closets to hang uniforms so they don't get wrinkled. A storage closet is located near the center of the carriage and is where staff know to go looking for Prim the Ticketmaster if she's had a hard day, as that is where she keeps her hanging punching bag. Hidden inside of this worn-out sandbag is a broken pickaxe and a pair of shackles.": "车厢的两端有两个卫生间，有马桶、水槽和淋浴，供工作人员使用。有五间卧室，每间卧室有四张双人床（像双层床一样叠在一起），一把椅子，一个箱子，还有两个小壁橱，用来挂制服，以免弄皱了。一个储物柜位于车厢中央附近，工作人员知道，如果普里姆今天过得很辛苦，就去找她，因为她把悬挂的打孔袋放在那里。这个破旧的沙袋里藏着一把破镐和一副脚镣。",
	"There are three standard sleeper cars, which each contain:": "有三个标准卧铺车厢，每个车厢都有。",
	"Four shared bathrooms with toilet, sink, and shower: two on one end and two in the middle of the carriage": "四个带厕所、水槽和淋浴的共用浴室：两个在车厢的一端，两个在车厢中间",

	"While not spacious, the rooms are all comfortable and more than generous for a train. The Rail-Away prides itself on being more accommodating than many stationary inns, a title that in many ways has been rightfully earned. The only way to tell the sleeper cars apart is by color and name, with each being decorated in a different color: royal blue (The Sapphire), deep green (The Emerald), and dark red (The Ruby).": "虽然不是很宽敞，但房间都很舒适，对于火车来说也是比较宽裕的。The Rail-Away为自己比许多固定的旅馆更方便而自豪，这个称号在很多方面都是理所当然的。区分卧铺车厢的唯一方法是通过颜色和名称，每个车厢都有不同的装饰：皇家蓝（蓝宝石）、深绿（绿宝石）和深红（红宝石）。",
	"The dining car, also known as The Silver Piece, is a comfortable space full of inviting smells and sights, with the grand red velvet window curtains always pulled back so guests can enjoy the passing scenery as they dine. The galley-like kitchen is located within the car, allowing the guests to enjoy watching Somen Gilrona, the halfling chef, prepare their food. Somen's fast-paced proficiency with her knives (and her cute little stool) are a means of entertainment in their own right.": "餐车也被称为 \"银件\"，是一个舒适的空间，充满了诱人的气味和景象，宏伟的红色天鹅绒窗帘总是被拉开，以便客人在用餐时可以欣赏到路过的风景。加利福尼亚式的厨房位于车内，使客人可以享受到半身人厨师Somen Gilrona为他们准备食物。苏门对她的刀具（和她可爱的小凳子）的快节奏熟练操作，本身就是一种娱乐手段。",
	"Meals are served throughout the day and can also be ordered directly to a room or a table in the other entertainment cars. There are seven tables that seat up to four, and four tables that seat two. The far right corner holds a table for condiments and utensils as well as pitchers of water and juice. Each table holds a small brass bell that can be rung for service. The tables are always set with crisp linen tablecloths, fine silverware, and a lit candle for atmosphere.": "膳食是全天供应的，也可以直接点到房间或其他娱乐车厢的桌子上。这里有七张可容纳四人的桌子，还有四张可容纳两人的桌子。最右边的角落里放着一张桌子，用来放置调味品和餐具，以及水和果汁的壶。每张桌子上都有一个小铜铃，可以敲响以提供服务。桌子上总是摆放着清爽的亚麻桌布、精致的银器和点燃的蜡烛，以营造气氛。",
	"The gaming car is called The Gold Coin, and aptly so; many a coin is lost and won here on any given day on both the card and dice tables. However, games of chance are not the only ones on offer here. You can also find guests playing games of Chess, Trail Seeker, Go, Nine Men's Morris, Knucklebones, Checkers, and Fox and Geese.": "这辆博彩车被称为 \"金币\"(The Gold Coin)，这一点很贴切；在任何一天，这里的牌桌和骰子桌都会输掉和赢取许多硬币。然而，这里提供的不仅仅是机会游戏。你还可以看到客人们在玩国际象棋、寻路者、围棋、九人莫里斯、敲锣打鼓、跳棋以及狐狸和鹅的游戏。",
	"The entire carriage has an open plan, with tables of various sizes scattered around. Plush carpets layer the floor. Like its name, the color scheme is garishly gold and practically glitters when the sun comes in the windows in the late afternoon. A cupboard holds a supply of games and cards, though guests can also bring their own. However, any playing cards used for gambling tables where coin is on the line must be staff-provided due to cheating issues in the past.": "整个车厢采用开放式设计，周围散布着各种大小的桌子。地板上铺着毛绒绒的地毯。就像它的名字一样，这里的颜色是华丽的金色，当下午的阳光照进窗户时，几乎是闪闪发光。一个柜子里放着游戏和纸牌的供应，尽管客人也可以自己带。然而，由于过去的作弊问题，任何用于赌桌的扑克牌都必须是工作人员提供的。",
	"The Gambler is known to frequent this tavern the most, either lounging here or in the Copper Penny.

	"The bar car, known as The Copper Penny, is the heart of the Rail-Away. It features a long wooden bar with a rich, smooth patina that comes only with age and the constant mopping up of spilled drinks. Comfortable leather bar stools line the counter, which is where most regular guests prefer to sit, as they are the best seats if you want to talk Raivo the bartender into free or special drinks. Raivo behind the bar is, in fact, what immediately draws anyone's eye the first time they enter The Copper Penny, as his flaming hair is impossible to ignore.": "被称为 \"铜钱 \"的酒吧车厢是 \"铁路之旅 \"的核心。它有一个长长的木制吧台，具有丰富、光滑的光泽，这是由年龄和不断擦拭洒出的饮料所带来的。舒适的皮制吧椅排在柜台上，这是大多数常客喜欢坐的地方，因为如果你想说服酒保雷沃提供免费或特别的饮料，他们是最好的座位。事实上，在第一次进入铜钱店时，吧台后面的雷沃立刻吸引了所有人的目光，因为他的火焰般的头发让人无法忽视。",
	"This car is by far the most popular carriage on the Rail-Away and a good place to meet any of the tavern's guests. There are three four-seater tables and four twoseater tables, one being located in the corner for privacy. Alongside the same side of the carriage as the bar is an open area used for entertainment or dancing. For boarding purposes, and to accommodate the loading and unloading of supplies, an additional door is located across from the stage area.": "这节车厢是迄今为止 \"铁路之路 \"上最受欢迎的车厢，也是会见酒馆任何客人的好地方。车厢里有三张四人座的桌子和四张两人座的桌子，其中一张位于角落里，以保护隐私。与酒吧同侧的车厢是一个开放区域，用于娱乐或跳舞。为便于登车和装卸物资，在舞台区对面还有一个门。",
	"There are two luxury accommodation sleeper cars for wealthy passengers to take advantage of: The Platinum and The Mithril. There are two suites in each carriage, which each include a private washroom (toilet, sink, and shower with brass fittings), a large bedroom (king size bed, wardrobe, desk and chair, two armchairs, and a small table), and an additional small bedroom (double bed and a chest). The small bedroom is most often used by children, retainers, or servants. Many wealthy visitors to the Rail-Away will rent an entire carriage so their important staff are near them, while others have their underlings stay in one of the normal sleeper cars.": "有两辆豪华住宿卧铺车供富裕的乘客使用。铂金号和米特拉号。每节车厢都有两个套房，每个套房都包括一个私人盥洗室（马桶、水槽和带黄铜配件的淋浴器）、一个大卧室（特大号床、衣柜、书桌和椅子、两把扶手椅和一张小桌子），以及另外一个小卧室（双人床和一个箱子）。小卧室最常被儿童、家臣或仆人使用。许多富裕的游客会租下一整节车厢，这样他们的重要工作人员就在他们身边，而其他人则让他们的下属住在普通的卧铺车厢中。",
	"In keeping with the guests, these cars are sumptuously appointed with comfortable furnishings and many small touches that showcase the Rail-Away's attention to detail: fresh flowers, a turndown service, and complimentary chocolates. Upon first check-in, guests are treated to a complimentary beverage.": "为了与客人保持一致，这些车厢的布置非常奢华，有舒适的家具和许多小装饰，显示了Rail-Away公司对细节的关注：新鲜的鲜花、睡前服务和免费的巧克力。第一次入住时，客人可以享受到免费的饮料。",
	"The Mercury Observatory car is one of the highlights of the Rail-Away. A raised open-air oval platform takes up the entire back end of the carriage, surrounded by iron railings with spear-shaped finials. A large brass telescope is affixed to the platform, providing guests with an opportunity to see the stars—or simply take a closer look at any towns or scenery the train is passing. A number of comfortable deck chairs and small tables are scattered around. Drinks can be ordered directly from any passing staff, or through a communication pipe in the wall.": "水星天文台车厢是铁路之旅的亮点之一。一个凸起的露天椭圆形平台占据了整个车厢的后端，周围是带有矛形顶饰的铁栏杆。一个大的黄铜望远镜贴在平台上，为游客提供了一个看星星的机会，或者只是仔细看看火车经过的任何城镇或风景。一些舒适的躺椅和小桌子散布在周围。饮料可以直接向任何路过的工作人员订购，或通过墙上的通信管道订购。",
	"The other half of the carriage is enclosed, but it still offers excellent visibility as it resembles a glass greenhouse with a tri-peaked roof. This way, guests can enjoy the view even in inclement weather. Couches and chairs with plump cushions are available, as well as some potted plants, which adds to the greenhouse atmosphere and lends a sense of privacy for late-night assignations.": "车厢的另一半是封闭的，但它仍然提供了极好的视野，因为它类似于一个有三层楼顶的玻璃温室。这样，即使在恶劣的天气下，客人也可以欣赏到美景。这里有带丰满坐垫的沙发和椅子，还有一些盆栽，这增加了温室的气氛，为深夜的约会带来了隐私感。",

	"Tarmo is a male high elf, and serves as the Rail-Away's conductor. Tarmo very much enjoys his job, though everyone knows that Prim is the one that really gets things done on the Rail-Away. Tarmo is more of a scholarly figurehead, opting to spend his time chatting amiably with the tavern's guests or studying history and languages. He is always particularly excited when someone speaks a rare language, and enjoys learning new words and phrases. (He endeavors to know how to say \"hello\" and \"thank you\" in every known language, and has a large collection of swear words written down in a leather-bound journal.) He wears spectacles and has never been seen dressed in anything other than his conductor's suit: a buttoned-up formal waistcoat with stiff lapels and gold braiding on the shoulders.": "塔莫是一名男性高等精灵，担任铁路运输的售票员。塔莫非常喜欢他的工作，尽管大家都知道普利姆才是真正能在铁路上完成工作的人。塔莫更像是一个学者型的人物，他选择把时间花在与酒馆的客人友好地聊天或研究历史和语言上。当有人说一种罕见的语言时，他总是特别兴奋，并喜欢学习新的单词和短语。(他努力知道如何用每一种已知的语言说 \"你好 \"和 \"谢谢\"，并在一本装订成皮的日记中写下了大量的脏话）。他戴着眼镜，从来没有人见过他穿着指挥家的衣服：一件扣上纽扣的正式马甲，有坚硬的翻领，肩上有金色的编织。",
	"Tarmo uses the {@creature mage} statistics but also knows the spells {@spell alarm} and {@spell unseen servant}. As an elf, he doesn't require sleep and often chooses to spend his time in trance in a quiet corner of the bar car, though he has a room of his own in the staff sleeper car. A student of languages, he can comfortably speak Common, Elvish, Dwarven, Giant, Halfling, Gnomish, and even a smattering of Infernal. He has a {@item wand of magic missiles} but will only use it as a last resort.": "塔莫使用（%0%）的统计数据，但也知道（%1%）和（%2%）的法术。作为一个精灵，他不需要睡眠，经常选择在酒吧车厢的一个安静角落里恍惚度过，尽管他在工作人员的卧铺车厢里有一个自己的房间。作为语言的学生，他能自如地讲普通话、精灵语、矮人语、巨人语、半身人语、地精语，甚至还能讲少量的地狱语。他有一个{@item wand of magic missiles}，但只在万不得已时才会使用它。",
	"He knows Verity's true form but has kept it secret, partly because she is the best entertainer the Rail-Away has ever had. He also trusts her to use her hidden abilities as crowd-control in unruly situations. She is teaching him how to speak Sylvan, but only the more vulgar terms.": "他知道Verity的真实形态，但一直保守秘密，部分原因是她是Rail-Away有史以来最好的艺人。他还相信她能在不守规矩的情况下使用她隐藏的能力作为人群控制。她正在教他如何说希尔凡语，但只是比较粗俗的术语。",
	"Tarmo knows that Raivo hates bats due to an unfortunate incident where one flew into his hair and burned to a crisp. He has also learned that the bartender loves cinnamon-based sugar sweets.": "塔莫知道雷沃讨厌蝙蝠，因为有一次不幸的事件，一只蝙蝠飞到他的头发上，被烧成了灰烬。他还了解到，这个酒保喜欢吃肉桂类的糖食。",
	"Prim is a young goblin woman who serves both as the authority figure on the Rail-Away and as its ticketmaster. Anyone who underestimates \"Knuckles\" does so to their detriment. Prim is on the smaller side, and coupled with the Rail-Away's standard starched and pressed uniform, she somewhat resembles a child's doll one would buy from the tavern's gift shop. However, besides her iron will, she carries with her a set of magic brass knuckles that she likes to refer to as \"One-Two Punch.\" Prim can be found on any carriage of the Rail-Away, as she makes continuous rounds. Her sudden appearance may surprise some guests due to her remarkably silent stride.": "普利姆是一个年轻的女妖精，她既是Rail-Away上的权威人物，又是它的售票员。任何低估 \"Knuckles \"的人都会对他们造成伤害。普利姆身材偏小，再加上铁路公司标准的星光闪闪的制服，她有点像一个从酒馆礼品店买来的儿童玩偶。然而，除了她的钢铁意志，她还带着一套神奇的铜指节，她喜欢把它称为 \"一二拳\"。普利姆可以在Rail-Away的任何一节车厢里找到，因为她会不断地巡视。她的突然出现可能会让一些客人感到惊讶，因为她的步伐非常安静。",
	"Long before she was known as Knuckles, Prim was a slave in a goblin mine owned by Lord Gammon. While digging one day, she uncovered a small treasure box containing a set of magical brass knuckles and a small bag of gems, all of which she carries to this day. They enabled her to escape and have served her well.": "在她被称为Knuckles之前，Prim是Gammon勋爵拥有的一个地精矿的奴隶。有一天，她在挖掘时发现了一个小宝盒，里面有一套神奇的铜指关节和一小袋宝石，这些东西她都带在身上，直到今天。这些东西使她得以逃脱，并一直为她服务。",
	"The items hidden in her punching bag help fuel the force behind her punches. If questioned about them, she may cave and explain a small portion of her history.": "藏在她的拳击袋中的物品有助于激发她的拳头背后的力量。如果被问及这些东西，她可能会屈服并解释她的一小部分历史。",

He wears thick, protective gear even in the sweltering heat of the engine room and does not appear to be affected by the temperature at all. A man of few words, he spends most of his time in the engine room or the bar car. He has a hearty laugh and a certain magnetism about him that seems to attract women of all races and types. Once a proud soldier of fortune, he found work on the Rail-Away after he grew tired of mercenary work. Brandr uses the {@creature veteran} statistics, but has a {@item Flame Tongue Longsword|DMG|flame tongue sword}.": "布兰德-芬丹是一名接近中年的男性，是 \"铁路之路 \"的工程师。勃兰特是一个高大结实的人，他有满脸的胡须和一头狂野的红发。即使在酷热的机房里，他也穿着厚厚的防护装备，似乎根本不受温度的影响。他是一个少言寡语的人，大部分时间都在机房或酒吧车厢里。他有一个爽朗的笑声，而且他身上有一种磁性，似乎能吸引所有种族和类型的女性。他曾经是一名骄傲的财富战士，在厌倦了雇佣兵的工作后，他在Rail-Away找到了工作。布兰德使用（%0%）的统计数据，但有一个（%1%）。",
	"Brandr has a {@item ring of fire elemental command} which allows him to control the fire elemental that powers the engine. In addition, he can speak Ignan while wearing the ring. In the most dangerous situations, he will use this in combat.": "布兰德尔有一个{@item ring of fire elemental command}，可以让他控制为引擎提供动力的火元素。此外，他在佩戴戒指时可以说伊格纳语。在最危险的情况下，他将在战斗中使用这个。",

	"Kogan Hamfist is an old hill dwarf who works as both the head porter and lead attendant. Kogan is an unusual dwarf who keeps a clean face (requiring shaving twice a day to keep up with his beard growth) and has unusually high charisma. Approaching old age, he is wise even beyond his years and knows how to keep his own counsel, an ideal trait for his job. He is in charge of all the standard sleeper cars and also manages the Copper Penny bar car and the Golden Coin gaming carriage.": "科根-哈姆菲斯特是一个老山矮人，他既是门房主管又是首席服务员。科根是一个不寻常的矮人，他保持着一张干净的脸（需要每天刮两次胡子才能跟上他的胡子生长速度），并且有异常高的魅力。年近古稀，他的智慧甚至超过了他的年龄，知道如何保持自己的意见，这是他工作的理想特点。他负责所有的标准卧铺车厢，还负责管理铜币酒吧车厢和金币游戏车厢。",
	"If questioned about his pride as a dwarf, he will calmly say,\"I am myself, not what you expect me to be.\" He only ever acts courteously, even in tense situations, and is quick to provide any service he and the other porters are capable of. He uses the {@creature commoner} stat block.": "如果有人质疑他作为一个矮人的骄傲，他会平静地说：\"我就是我自己，而不是你们期望的那样。\" 他只表现得很有礼貌，即使在紧张的情况下也是如此，并迅速提供他和其他搬运工所能提供的任何服务。他使用（%0%）状态块。",

	"A porter is assigned to each sleeper car. They are responsible for making sure everything is in order, keeping the area clean, and seeing to the needs of the guests.

	"Verity is a gorgeous elven musician, and is the stationary bard for the Rail-Away. Tall and shapely, with long black hair all the way down her back, Verity commonly wears form-fitting dresses that can best be described as evening wear (even to drink her morning coffee). She has been the Rail-Away's resident performer for a number of years, resulting in many repeat guests who stay simply to appreciate her singing... and perhaps her features. She has a low, husky voice even when conversing normally, and people find themselves leaning in to catch every word she says. Verity stays in one of the double rooms in the Ruby sleeper car rather than the staff car.": "维里蒂是一位华丽的精灵音乐家，是铁道部的固定吟游诗人。高挑的身材，黑色的长发一直披在背上，维里蒂通常穿着贴身的裙子，可以说是最适合的晚礼服（甚至是喝她的早晨咖啡）。多年来，她一直是Rail-Away的常驻表演者，导致许多回头客仅仅为了欣赏她的歌声而留下来......也许还有她的特征。她的声音低沉、沙哑，即使在正常交谈时也是如此，人们发现自己会靠过去听她说的每个字。Verity住在红宝石卧铺车厢的一个双人房间里，而不是员工车厢。",

A particularly hot-headed youth with an anger problem, Raivo was cursed by an ancient and powerful efreeti during an argument (one that he has forgotten the cause of, so frequent and inconsequential were his disagreements). The most prevalent effect of this curse is Raivo's hair, which acts like opaque fire.

	"The curse placed on him by the efreeti is so powerful that it cannot be removed by a normal {@spell remove curse} spell.

Rather than murdering him at home, they had decided it would be best to carry out the plot in public, making sure they both had an alibi. They sourced some poison and a {@item periapt of proof against poison} and bided their time. Esthene made sure that everyone saw her \"break up\" with Lord Gammon, while Ulume created her own alibi by snoring loudly in her bedroom. Esthene made her way to the Observation Car that night to poison him via the Rail-Away's roof. If the player characters went with Lord Gammon, she will be surprised to see them there and will quickly kiss him (depositing the poison via her lipstick, which contains a slow acting {@item Oil of Taggit} poison mixed with wax and cochineal dye from crushed fire beetle shells). She then returned to her room via the same route she took before (again witnessed by Ryman Thorn). This is what actually kills Lord Gammon.": "Ulume Gammon夫人和她同父异母的妹妹Esthene Moonshadow密谋除掉Gammon勋爵已经有一段时间了。与其在家里谋杀他，他们决定最好是在公开场合实施这个阴谋，确保他们都有不在场证明。他们找来了一些毒药和一个{@item periapt of proof against poison}，等待时机。埃斯特恩确保每个人都看到她与甘蒙勋爵的 \"分手\"，而乌鲁米则在她的卧室里大声打鼾，制造自己的不在场证明。当天晚上，埃斯特恩来到了观察车，通过轨道车的车顶毒死了他。如果玩家角色与甘蒙勋爵一起去，她看到他们在那里会很惊讶，并会迅速吻他（通过她的唇膏沉积毒药，其中含有一种混合了蜡和从粉碎的火甲虫壳中提取的胭脂红染料的缓效（1%）毒药）。然后她通过之前的路线回到了自己的房间（再次由雷曼-索恩见证）。这就是真正杀死甘蒙勋爵的原因。",
	"Prim and Trackle are overjoyed to be reunited, as both had thought the other dead. Prim, for her part, is also anxious to release Trackle from her servitude and even speaks to Tarmo Warberry about finding her cousin a job on the Rail-Away. Trackle knows that Ulume and Esthene are planning something, so she wants to get out as soon as possible before things get bad. When Trackle goes to get the honey milk, Prim gives her something: a gem from her stash, just in case Trackle needs some escape funds. This trade acts as a red herring that reveals Gammon's history.": "Prim和Trackle对重逢感到非常高兴，因为他们都认为对方已经死了。Prim也急于把Trackle从她的奴役中解放出来，甚至和Tarmo Warberry谈起为她的表妹在Rail-Away上找一份工作。Trackle知道Ulume和Esthene在计划着什么，所以她想在事情变得糟糕之前尽快离开。当Trackle去拿蜂蜜牛奶时，Prim给了她一样东西：从她的藏品中拿出一颗宝石，以备Trackle需要一些逃跑资金。这个交易就像一个红色的诱饵，揭示了甘蒙的历史。",

	"The day before, Lord Almanor had noted with interest the interaction between Verity and Gammon and, with his true seeing, had easily penetrated her disguise. When Gammon once again turns him down, Almanor decides to threaten him. He requests that Verity sing her Enchanting Song.

	"While she is singing, Lord Almanor uses his Rakshasa claw attack discreetly on Lord Gammon, cursing him and causing a small trickle of blood on his neck.

However, Gammon dies before he is able to threaten him again.": "在她唱歌的时候，阿尔曼诺勋爵对甘蒙勋爵谨慎地使用了他的罗刹爪攻击，诅咒他，并使他的脖子上出现了一小滴血。这个神奇的诅咒是为了在甘蒙睡觉时生效，让他的思想充满可怕的图像和梦境。他的计划是用诅咒迫使甘蒙屈服于他的要求。然而，甘蒙在他能够再次威胁他之前就死了。",
	"The Rail-Away started small: just an engine and a single cargo car with a few bunk beds inside. Over the years, it grew larger and larger, and more and more grandiose. Under Tarmo Warberry, new destinations have been added and new track laid in his quest to cover more territory (and learn about the languages and people who live there).
