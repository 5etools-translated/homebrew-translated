	"A series of regal-looking interconnected hallways are dimly lit with magical torches suspended in sconces. The entrance that the intruders come through suddenly closes itself off, and the intruders sit in silence for a few seconds. Looking down one of the other hallways reveals a slowly encroaching patch of darkness that snuffs out the torches as it makes its way forward, which relight themselves when intruders approach them while the darkness is not nearby. The intruders must search the various corridors while simultaneously avoiding the patch of darkness, which envelops and leaves no trace of anything that enters it. Any attempts to do combat with the darkness prove ineffectual, as anything that enters vanishes, never to be seen again. The darkness is semi-sentient, and the intruders can interact with it by trying to hide from it or get it to follow them. The key to escaping the hallways lies with the magic torches in the two impressively decorated sconces that the darkness can't seem to pass by. By removing one of the special torches and carrying it with them, an intruder can hold off the darkness or even push it back. However, confronting it for too long will begin to dim the torch until it eventually snuffs out, forcing the holder to escape the darkness in order for the torch to relight. When the special torches approach the darkness from both sides of a hallway, it condenses and eventually fades, leaving a shadowy door to the outside where the last of it vanished.": "一系列看起来很威严的相互连接的走廊，用悬挂在壁炉上的魔法火把昏暗地照明。入侵者经过的入口突然关闭，入侵者在沉默中坐了几秒钟。向其他走廊看去，发现有一片慢慢侵袭的黑暗，它在前进的过程中扼杀了火把，当入侵者在黑暗中接近它们时，火把就会重新点燃。入侵者必须在搜索各个走廊的同时避开那片黑暗，那片黑暗将任何进入它的东西都包裹起来，不留任何痕迹。任何与黑暗作战的尝试都是无效的，因为任何进入的东西都会消失，再也看不到了。黑暗是半知觉的，入侵者可以通过试图躲避它或让它跟随他们来与它互动。逃离走廊的关键在于两个装饰精美的壁炉中的魔法火把，黑暗似乎无法通过。通过移除其中一个特殊的火把并随身携带，入侵者可以挡住黑暗，甚至将其逼退。然而，与它对峙太久，火把就会开始变暗，直到最终熄灭，迫使持有者逃离黑暗，以使火把重新点燃。当特殊火把从走廊两边接近黑暗时，它就会凝结并最终消退，在最后消失的地方留下一扇通往外面的阴暗之门。",
	"A roughly cut gemstone hovers ominously over a crude alter in a cavernlike room while a malicious spirit floats up around the ceiling and out of sight. New entities entering the room causes the crystal turn to face the intruders, revealing that it is actually an eye of some sort, containing a pupil that darts rapidly between the intruders and the spirit. The spirit immediately begins cajoling the crystal eye into destroying the intruders, talking to it as though it were a child in need of guidance. After a few seconds of apparent listening, the eye completely focuses on the spirit and pillars of rock begin to rapidly erupt from the room's surfaces at points near the intruders. The pillars, while initially inaccurate, begin homing in on the intruders more and more the longer they stay still, and do 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The key to escaping the room is the crystal eye in the center of the room, which is being told by the spirit to kill the intruders. By being more persuasive than the spirit, intruders can convince the eye to stop its onslaught and eventually target the spirit instead, which will disperse after being hit multiple times with pillars of rock. The eye is very childlike in its considerations and will lose focus if the intruders fail to convince it or begin to act too impatient. Simplistic approaches work well, and the eye responds positively to constructive encouragement when it targets the intruders (That was some very good aiming, I could feel the wind rush by me! Next time though, try to aim towards the mean spirit instead, OK?). Once the spirit is destroyed, a gentle suggestion that the eye create an exit will convince it to pull a slab of rock away from a wall and reveal a passage to outside the room.": "在一个类似于洞穴的房间里，一颗粗糙切割的宝石不祥地盘旋在一个简陋的改变上，而一个恶意的灵魂漂浮在天花板上，看不见了。新的实体进入房间，使水晶转而面对入侵者，显示出它实际上是某种眼睛，包含一个在入侵者和精神之间快速穿梭的瞳孔。灵魂立即开始劝说水晶眼消灭入侵者，对它说话，好像它是一个需要指导的孩子。经过几秒钟明显的倾听，水晶眼完全集中在精神上，石柱开始从房间的表面迅速喷发到入侵者附近的地方。这些石柱，虽然一开始并不准确，但开始越来越多地瞄准入侵者，他们静止的时间越长，一击就会造成5d10的重击伤害。逃出房间的关键是房间中央的水晶眼，它正被灵魂告知要杀死入侵者。通过比水晶眼更有说服力，入侵者可以说服水晶眼停止攻击，并最终以水晶眼为目标，而水晶眼在被石柱多次击中后就会消散。眼睛的考虑非常幼稚，如果入侵者不能说服它或开始表现得过于急躁，它就会失去注意力。简单的方法很有效，当眼睛瞄准入侵者时，它对建设性的鼓励有积极的反应（那是一些非常好的瞄准，我可以感觉到风从我身边冲过！）。不过下一次，请试着瞄准卑鄙的灵魂，好吗？） 一旦精神被摧毁，温柔地建议眼睛创造一个出口，就会说服它把一块石头从墙上拉开，露出一个通往房间外的通道。",

Once the next hallway both statues have hands that turn, and one activates the traps just cleared while the other deactivates the ones ahead (but both can't happen so if the try to deactivate the traps ahead it will still be active). And finally the last hallway will deactivate the traps but the floor is pressure sensitive. Illustrate this by having the party see the hand start to turn back when a member starts to walk across.

A kobold who was waiting kicks a weight attached to a chain out and it drags the member down the side of the cliff to about 20 ft. above the next level (assuming they don't pass a strength check at disadvantage). The ambush comes and there are kobolds on the lower level trying to reach the member while the party is ambushed and distracted. They will have to decide who is saving their friend and who is fighting, while the member is dangling and until he gets himself right side up is at a disadvantage to all attacks.

	"A seemingly normal abandoned bathroom. There is a tripwire coming out of one of the stalls, that tightly seals the only door. Then, contaminated water starts coming out of the toilets. The adventurers must break the door to escape, and if they touch the water, they get sick.": "一个看似正常的废弃浴室。有一根绊马索从其中一个隔间里出来，紧紧地封住了唯一的门。然后，被污染的水开始从厕所里流出来。冒险家们必须破门而出，如果他们碰到水，就会生病。",

Slowly but surely, a neurotoxin starts coming out of the holes, and seamlessly fills the room, while the adventurers sleep.": "一间卧室，有足够的床供党员们睡觉。床垫下有压力板，可以在墙上打开小孔。缓慢但肯定的是，一种神经毒素开始从洞里出来，无缝地填满房间，而冒险家们正在睡觉。",
	"A rickety wooden bridge over a big dark pit, with snakes on the bottom. There is a hole on one of the side walls (requiring a passive perception check to notice).

	"This is a standard pit-trap with a twist. At the bottom of the pit, and for ten feet up the walls, everything is coated in pitch. Pitch may be sticky, but in quantity it also acts like any other oil-based liquid–a lubricant. Climbing up a rope becomes extremely unlikely for whoever fell down the hole. But that's not the worst bit. A couple of rounds after the pit trap is activated, the Kobolds, warned by a bell attached to the pit trap's trigger, will show up with lit torches. And one of them will start combat by throwing a torch into the pit–igniting the pitch!": "这是一个标准的坑道陷阱，但有一个转折点。在坑的底部和坑壁的十英尺处，所有东西都被涂上了沥青。沥青可能是粘性的，但在数量上它也像任何其他油基液体一样，是一种润滑剂。无论谁掉进坑里，用绳子爬上去都变得极不可能。但这还不是最糟糕的一点。坑道陷阱启动后的几个回合，哥布林们会带着点燃的火把出现，他们会被连接到坑道陷阱触发器的铃铛警告。其中一个会把火把扔进坑里开始战斗--点燃火把！这时，他们会把火把扔进坑里。",
	"Oil floats on water: You all know the scene. In the middle of the vast dungeon is a lake. At one edge of the lake is a boat. The heroes have to pile into the boat and row across the lake to the next section of the dungeon. Well, this particular lake is guarded by kobolds with spyglasses. And a few barrels full of lamp oil. And a torch. Be sure to wait until the party is most of the way across the lake before the kobolds start pouring lamp oil on the water.": "石油漂浮在水面上。你们都知道这个场景。在巨大的地牢中间有一个湖。在湖的一个边缘有一条船。英雄们必须挤上船，划过湖面，到达地牢的下一个部分。好吧，这个特殊的湖由带着窥视镜的哥布林看守着。还有几个装满灯油的桶。还有一个火把。在哥布林们开始往水里倒灯油之前，一定要等到队伍过了湖的大部分路程。",
	"Kobolds are light, and armor is heavy: A well prepared Kobold always has an escape route. And his escape route is generally one only a Kobold can use. While most Kobolds choose to make tight passages that only a Tiny creature can squeeze into (thanks to their ability to fit into unlikely places), some rely on the fact that their pursuers are generally heavier, and in larger numbers, than themselves. Choose a corridor, and undermine it (dig a tunnel under the floor, but with too little material acting as floor/ceiling). Leave it just enough strength to handle the weight of a Kobold or two. Fill the corridor below with something nasty, and have it lead somewhere nasty. As a finishing touch, make sure there's a collapsing ceiling in the upper tunnel as well to ensure that the heroes can't climb back out after you.": "哥布林人很轻，而盔甲很重：一个准备充分的哥布林人总是有一条逃生路线。而他的逃跑路线通常是只有哥布林人才能使用的。虽然大多数哥布林选择了只有小个子生物才能挤进去的狭窄通道（由于他们有能力适应不可能的地方），但有些哥布林依靠的事实是，他们的追捕者通常比自己更重，而且数量更多。选择一条走廊，并破坏它（在地板下挖一条隧道，但作为地板/天花板的材料太少）。留给它足够的力量来承受一两个哥布林的重量。在下面的走廊里填上一些恶心的东西，并让它通向一个恶心的地方。作为点睛之笔，确保上面的通道也有一个坍塌的天花板，以确保英雄们在你之后不能再爬出来。",
	"Gold melts at a surprisingly low temperature: Did you know that you can melt gold in a candle flame? It would probably take about an hour to do so from room temperature, but you can. More importantly, if you keep your gold coins at a hot enough temperature, they'll melt very quickly if exposed to a very potent heat source–like say they might melt within seconds if they were doused in lamp oil and lit. This is an interesting thing to note if your chosen method of storing gold coins is in a wire-mesh cage attached to the ceiling. Especially if such a cage is kept at very high temperature, and is trapped with various kinds of flame traps (flame traps that trigger onto the gold). Unfortunately, while the temperature might be relatively high compared to the meltin point of most metal, it's still more than enough to cook any flesh it comes in contact with (and STICK to that flesh, as molten metal tends to, causing the WORST sort of burns). And of course, the easiest way to get at the gold itself is from directly below it. Be sure to note to the party how hot it is in the room with the gold while they're standing under it. If they're clever enough to figure out the trap beforehand, hopefully they're also clever enough to notice the hidden drains in the floor before all that molten gold runs (very, very quickly) down those drains.": "黄金的熔化温度低得令人吃惊。你知道你可以在蜡烛火焰中熔化黄金吗？从室温开始可能需要一个小时才能做到，但你可以。更重要的是，如果你把你的金币放在足够热的温度下，如果暴露在一个非常强大的热源下，它们会很快融化，比如说，如果它们被浇在灯油中并被点燃，它们可能在几秒钟内融化。如果你选择的储存金币的方法是在连接在天花板上的铁丝网笼子里，这是一个值得注意的事情。特别是如果这样的笼子被保存在非常高的温度下，并且用各种火焰陷阱（触发到金币上的火焰陷阱）来困住。不幸的是，虽然与大多数金属的熔点相比，温度可能相对较高，但它仍然足以煮熟它所接触的任何肉体（并粘在肉体上，因为熔化的金属往往会造成最糟糕的烧伤）。当然，获取黄金本身的最简单方法是从它的正下方。一定要向当事人说明，当他们站在金子下面时，房间里有多热。如果他们足够聪明，能提前发现这个陷阱，希望他们也足够聪明，能在所有熔化的金子流进（非常非常快）排水管之前注意到地板上的隐藏排水管。",
	"At the end of a hallway is a fake door. When the doorknob is turned, a latch is released, and the spring mounted door flies out at whoever opened the door. Since the door takes up most of the hallway, there is no chance to dodge it at all.

The character is teleported to a sealed tomb filled with the skeletons of various victims. A black pudding, CR equal to the party, attempts to engulf the teleported PC and turn him into a skeleton with its acid.

Make a Search DC 25 to notice the skeleton (pile of bones) is not the same makeup as the PC (DC 20 if the size category of the PC is one larger or smaller than medium).
