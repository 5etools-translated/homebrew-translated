Alternatively, you can state a destination, and the house will begin moving towards that destination without you needing to constantly tell it where to move, as long as you know where the destination is. Additionally, you can use an action to call the house to you, as long as it is on the same plane of existence as you. The house immediately sprouts legs if it hasn't already, and begins move directly towards you as quickly as it can.
