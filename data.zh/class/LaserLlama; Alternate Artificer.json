Before him laid an automaton of intricate iron gears within a suit of plate armor, built to resemble a large gnome.

With a sharp motion, the Steel Defender sat upright and awaited the first command of its creator.",

He was confident that this time he would stop the adventurers that always seemed to find their way to his home.",
