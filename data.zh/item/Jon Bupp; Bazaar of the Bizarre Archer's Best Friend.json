				"You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with this magic weapon. However, a longbow of marksmanship also gives you a +5 attack bonus against any nonliving target (including golems, undead, etc.). This bonus is also gained when attempting a trick shot, as long as that shot is not intended to directly harm another character or creature. In other words, the +5 bonus applies to an attempt to shoot an apple off another character's head, hitting an opponent's weapon, or any similar shot.",

				"This appears to be a transparent bow with a sparkling string. When the string is drawn back, a shimmering arrow appears. The glowing arrows provide a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls. The arrows vanish with no effect if they miss their intended target. The phantom bow fires 1d20 + 40 of these arrows, after which point the bow vanishes. Normal and magical arrows can also be fired from this weapon, but magical arrows gain no additional attack bonus. Each normal arrow fired from the bow gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. Furthermore, these arrows can be fired without detracting from the bow's longevity (i.e., the bow's magic is not decreased by firing normal arrows).",

				"{@i Frief's magical quiver functions as a normal quiver until it contains only one arrow of any sort. Every day at dawn, if it only contains a single arrow it magically refills itself, with up to a dozen arrows. If only one magic arrow is left, that arrow disappears and is replaced by 12 arrows with a magical bonus one less than that of the original arrow; e.g., an arrow+2 is replaced by 12 arrows +1; an arrow +1 is replaced by 12 magical arrows with no attack bonus; a magical arrow with no bonus is replaced by 12 normal arrows; a normal arrow is replaced by 12 normal arrows. This continues until only normal arrows are left, but only one replacement occurs per day.",

				"This quiver appears to be a normal quiver, although it has magical properties much like a ​bag of holding. Up to 200 arrows can be held in this quiver without adding any further encumbrance to the bowman (the quiver itself weighs as much as a normal quiver without any additions from the quiver's contents). The arrows within the quiver are easily accessible and may be of any sort, though finding the exact magical arrow desired may prove difficult.",
