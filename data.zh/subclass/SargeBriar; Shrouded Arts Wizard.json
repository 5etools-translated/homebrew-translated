				"The tradition of the Shrouded Arts is one not well known by the general populace, and its practitioners prefer to keep it that way. Blending arcane techniques of illusion and enchantment, shrouds have honed their skills to excel in covert operations: infiltration, espionage, stealth and subterfuge. An experienced shroud can infiltrate a castle, sabotage an outpost, or steal critical documents, all without raising suspicion.",
				"The powers of subterfuge granted by this tradition draw students from across the moral spectrum. Some shrouds align themselves with noble causes, working alone or with clandestine organizations to expose corruption or learn the plans of mighty villains. Others exploit their abilities to plunder hidden secrets, using them to gain power. A few simply adopt the Shrouded Arts out of necessity, seeing them as the only way to survive in places where use of arcane, or unsanctioned, magic is outlawed.",
