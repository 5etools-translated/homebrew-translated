				"The Great Cold is a being tucked deep in the clouds atop the highest mountains that none dare to climb. Where Ice Giants walk and where Griffons soar through the murky clouds, lives a being said to be the sole embodiment of frost, but these are tales spun to give the masses a fantasy to explain what lurks in the sub zero winds above the atmosphere. In actuality, none know what the Great Cold looks like, though if near one's death bed or seekers of the mountain's power are visited by Snowy Owls, chances are they are within his domain. It is here that one will either bargain their lives from a frozen tomb or offer service to the Lord of The Mountain's Bite through his trusted voice, the snowy owls. To gain favor and power with the Great Cold one must spread his influence across the land where his winds cannot reach, to spread cold and let his messenger owls survey the unknown. If one should wane in their frozen master's bidding, owls shall congregate and his voice shall remind the Warlock of their ultimate goal. \"Climb mountains child, reach the peaks, let my ice wisp about you and my owls be your sight. Through you I may travel to heights unknown, your powers and my domain shall then grow evermore powerful. Thaw and the winds shall rend your flesh and the messengers devour your eyes in my name\"",

				"Also starting at level 1, your patron provides you with your own \"Messenger\": a spectral snowy owl. This owl is an incorporeal entity that only you can see, no matter where you are the owl will follow you or be within your field of vision so long as you are a Warlock of the Great Cold. Your owl does not attack on your behalf, nor is it able to deal or receive damage from external sources, the owl no longer exists once the Warlock is killed. Your owl can speak to you telepathically in any language that you know, mimicking your voice. If it deems necessary for your survival, it will appear within one of your ally's vision and telepathically speak to them so long as they are within 120ft from you. Once you are safe it will leave your ally's sight and return to your own.",
				"Once per day you can see through your spectral owl's eyes for up to your Warlock level + your Charisma modifier minutes. Your spectral owl may only fly 120ft away from you before it fades away and returns beside you, the owl cannot pass through walls, through your owls eyes you have 60ft of Darkvision. Your sight returns to your body if your owl flies too far away, if you are physically altercated while looking through your owl's eyes, or you choose to end the ability. You may use this ability again after a short or long rest."
