						"Eberron has always had a unique relationship with arcane magic. As the setting that introduced the artifcer and the magewright, it looked at a world in which magic was treated seriously as a science. It stands to reason that the wizards of such a world would also push the boundaries of arcane research and develop unique magical traditions. This book deals with &ve such traditions, each of which is strongly tied to the world of Eberron.",
						"While the {@b Elemental Binders} of Zilargo are best known for their creation of elementally-powered vehicles, they can also focus the strength of the elements to enhance their spellcasting and even their own bodies.",
						"The {@b Dust Savants} search out arcane secrets hoarded by the servants of the Overlords or lost since the Age of Demons. Few trust those who delve into such dark powers, even if they use such knowledge to stand against the Lords of Dust.",
						"The {@b Knights Arcane} are the elite &ghting force of Aundair, who train with sword and spell. The Knight Phantoms among their number are feared across the Five Nations.",
						"The city of Sharn is famous across Eberron, and for good reason. The unique properties of the manifest zone to the plane of Syrania that Sharn is built upon allow for impossibly-tall towers, floating buildings, and easy magical air travel. The {@b Sharn Skymages} have tapped into this connection to enhance their own powers of magical flight.",
						"While most religion in Eberron is a pure matter of faith, there is no denying the reality of the Silver Flame. While most who harness the power of the Flame do so through purely divine magics, there are a small number of {@b Silver Pyromancers} who have managed to blend just enough divine magic into their own practices to tap into this power. These wizards enhance the fire that their spells produce with the holy power of the Silver Flame."
