								"大自然，或者说森林，可能离我们的家、Twitch流，或者我们玩RPG游戏的舞台（%0%）（因为奇怪的是，这就是我们现在生活的神奇世界）有相当的距离。我们把骰子扔到由树木制成的表面上，而这些树木的历史我们完全不知道。这棵树是否有一个故事，或住着一个猫头鹰家族，或在它的树枝下躲避风暴的狐狸伴侣？在我们编织自己的故事时，我们不知道这些故事，但这种联系仍然存在。我们仍然在荒野中跋涉，闻着新鲜空气，害怕它的危险，即使是在我们的想象中。",
								"讲故事本身就一直与自然有关。关于动物为神或动物为人类主角的传说渗透到所有文化中。美国本土的乌鸦捣蛋的故事，中世纪的{@i Owl and the Nightingale}寓言，或者像{@i Grimm's Fairy Tales}这样明显而简单的东西，都是我们周围的自然世界如何塑造故事的例子。动物的魔力和它们通常不为人知的生活让我们感到好奇，激发我们的想象力，当我们最终放慢脚步去看时，我们会在它们身上看到很多自己的影子。动物将我们与自然联系在一起，是一个强有力的讲故事的渠道。",
								"这就是为什么我相信角色扮演游戏在过去几年有如此大的复苏，因为我们正在寻找与我们周围世界的联系。我们正在寻找一种远离屏幕的方法，忘记我们复杂的生活，并作为英雄生活在我们可以解决的问题中，而不仅仅是听新闻和担心。我们可以帮助别人，我们可以成为英雄，而且我们有魔法。即使在想象中，这些东西也是令人难以置信的强大。",
								"在汉伯伍德，我们要回到我们作为讲故事者的根源，利用自然和我们周围的动物，在一个幻想的世界里冒险。我们每天都有这么多的技术围绕着我们，对许多人来说，走到大自然中去不是一个选择。我们的工作耗费时间，我们的生活艰难而复杂，我们的食物是在我们永远不会看到的地方种植的，并在塑料包装的货架上供我们食用。这些东西使我们与大自然的故事脱节，与生命的故事和季节的变化以及我们与周围世界的联系脱节。在现实中，即使是卑微的鸽子也有一个有趣的生活，只是我们没有看到，因为我们在城市街道上与它们擦肩而过，没有多看它们一眼。",
								"从我记事起，我就喜欢鸟类，它们一直是我与大自然联系的方式。我从10岁起就开始救助鸟类，从最小的蜂鸟到巨大的喜怒无常的红尾鹰，名叫伊万，我在大学时曾为它清理喵喵。当我住在洛杉矶时，我开始救助鸽子，因为它们无处不在，是被殖民者遗忘的宠物，对它们生活的栖息地具有侵略性。这些鸟儿聪明、有趣，而且几乎被你带去的每个动物收容所忽视。它们是动物世界中的迷失者和被遗忘者，这就是我爱上它们的原因。它们有故事可讲，而且每只都有自己的个性和怪癖。",
								"人类与动物没有什么不同。如果我们关注它们，我们就能理解它们，拯救它们，与它们一起生活，并尊重它们。我们对动物的同情心越强，我们的世界就越美好。讲述它们的故事和讲述我们自己的故事一样重要，有助于我们与地球上的其他生物建立联系，并对它们抱有同情心。因此，我鼓励你在汉伯伍德创造你自己的传说，然后到森林里去亲自看看它们。也许它们也会有自己的故事要告诉你。",

								"当接近汉伯伍德的艺术指导时，我想表达的是，这是一个充满了充满活力、多样化的人物的世界，他们生活在一个有着丰富而复杂的历史的广阔的森林中。汉伯伍德作为一个概念背后的驱动力是希望创造一个视觉上引人注目的世界，让人感觉到生命力，这意味着一个可以感觉到美妙和温馨、神奇和神秘的世界。这也意味着一个充满秘密、隐藏的危险和障碍的世界，供冒险者的队伍去克服。",
								"在我年轻的时候，我最热衷的电影和书籍是那些吸引年轻人和老年人的电影和书籍，它们的角色可能碰巧是可爱的林地动物，但仍然勇敢地探索了复杂的、对抗性的主题，我们在成年后仍会继续困惑。这些故事给我留下了深刻的印象，直到今天我还在继续重温这些故事。",
								"角色扮演游戏之所以精彩，有很多原因，其中一个原因是它们可以提供一种逃避的形式，或者它们可以反映现实。它们可以帮助我们通过一个完全不同的视角来理解和处理我们自己的生活经历，它们给你一种独特的自由，让你成为你想成为的人或事，在Humblewood不乏这样的选择--无论你是一个阴险的Mapach，一个勇敢的小strig，还是一个狡猾的corvum，有一颗秘密的黄金之心，唯一的限制，一如既往，就是你的想象力。",
								"作为艺术家，我们必须仔细考虑世界的方方面面，当然，我们的主角和无数的怪物的设计，但也要考虑角色的家可能是什么样子，他们可能穿什么样的面料，以及我们应该如何设计这瓶古老的Vulpin制作的接骨木酒？我们绘制了充斥着光束的森林、纠结而险恶的沼泽地，你必须坚定地穿过这些地方，还有舒适的室内环境，你几乎可以闻到烤箱里烘烤的杰比恩大小的面包。爱往往体现在细节中，正如一场战役中最重要的一些时刻可能是安静的时刻，在篝火旁交换的小话，或表明要解开更大的谜团的微小线索。",
								"创作这个项目是一个难忘的旅程，像汉伯伍德的杂草丛生的小路一样充满了惊喜、曲折和转折。我一生都对自然和动物情有独钟，这是我许多个人作品的主要灵感来源。我记得当我第一次坐下来画出一只勇敢的小猫头鹰（我们现在把它命名为Riffin）的第一稿时，我在那一刻根本无法想象这只小猫头鹰背后的想法会如何演变为一个完全实现的世界，由我们的设计师、作家和艺术家团队精心打造，供玩家探索。",

								"在遥远的埃弗登世界，在一个大洲的东海岸，有一片巨大的森林，依偎在山和海之间。这就是谦卑之林，一个古老而神奇的地方，它哼着无尽的歌，随着生与死的大节奏而歌唱。森林，正如它的居民所知道的那样，与其他森林不同。这里的树木古老而强大，稀有的标本可以达到小山一样的高度。在这里，熟悉的野兽成长为不寻常的大小，带有森林特有的标记和图案。这个地区也是两组类似动物的人形种族的家园，鸟人和卑微的人。他们共同分享森林和它丰富的资源。",
								"早年，鸟人和卑贱的人在森林周围的小村庄里彼此相邻而居。这些孤立的社区很容易受到一个自称为 \"强盗联盟 \"的强盗和掠夺者组织的攻击。为了保护自己免受联盟的侵害，鸟人在森林的树冠上建造了坚固的城市。鸟人军队与卑微的人类联合起来，被称为 \"鲈鱼卫队\"，赶走了强盗，给这个地区带来了和平与安全。随着时间的推移，鸟人文化不断传播，首都阿尔德心成为森林中最具政治影响力的地方。",
								"但森林也有过悲伤。在Alderheart成立后不久，一场被称为 \"大灾难 \"的大规模森林火灾烧毁了森林的一部分。这场大火的起因不明，但它给该地区留下了永久性的破坏。时至今日，这里被称为 \"焦土林\"，是一片干旱的灰烬地，从此成为许多奇怪的火焰生物的家园。",
								"补给者，一个由德鲁伊和神秘主义者组成的组织，致力于用自然魔法治愈焦土森林。他们在森林周围建立了小团体，每当森林火灾发生时，他们都会提供帮助。然而，自从丛林被烧毁后，森林就很少发生火灾了。不过，大自然的平衡可能会被一个小小的火花所破坏。",
								"最近，大火开始在森林中肆虐，火势之猛烈是历代以来所没有的。森林居民再次被赶出他们的家园，在阿尔德心寻求庇护，而栖息地居民则尽其所能地在他们的天幕避难所中保护自己的安全。卑微的人和鸟人之间的关系很紧张。此外，一个新成立的强盗联盟的人数也在增加。他们把目光投向了阿尔德心，在那里，那些因火焰而流离失所的人正在寻找生存的方法。",
								"你是森林的公民，被卷入这场动乱。或者，你是来自另一个世界的说书人。无论是哪种方式，森林的未来都由你来书写。在这本书中，你会发现你需要的所有工具，以建立你的角色，旅行这片土地，并创造你自己的汉伯伍德故事。",

										"虽然是一个多样化的群体，适应森林中的各种环境，但鸟人也有几个共同的身体特征，这使得他们在建造他们的栖息地时能够找到共同点。除了明显的身体相似性，所有的鸟人都拥有覆盖着羽毛的手臂，这些手臂延伸成类似翅膀的附属物。虽然没有能力进行真正的动力飞行，但鸟人强壮的空心骨和轻盈的身体使他们能够轻松地使用他们的羽毛手臂进行滑翔，除非有严重的障碍，否则所有的鸟人都能从本来是致命的坠落中优雅地恢复。在一些鸟人种族中，这些翅膀已经强大到足以在强大的扇动中把它们的主人往上带，而另一些则发展出爪子，既是致命的防御武器，也是攀爬高大树木的有用工具。",
										"鸟人已经确立了自己在汉伯伍德不可忽视的政治力量。他们在伟大的树Alderheart上塑造了他们强大的首都，在这个安全堡垒上，他们的统治机构，鸟人委员会，做出了影响整个汉伯伍德的决定。鸟人对外界的威胁有很好的防御，这要归功于Perch Guard，这是一支受过空中和地面战斗训练的士兵队伍，保证了他们的城市和居民的安全。",

										"数年前，森林底层的人们达成了一项协议，联合起来对抗流窜的强盗，平息了肆虐整个森林的内斗。这项协议被称为 \"卑微者条约\"，并由鸟人见证，他们当时刚刚开始塑造阿尔德心的树干。鸟人在他们伟大的城市里为卑微的人们提供安全，许多人接受了他们的提议。随着时间的推移，越来越多的卑微者移居到新建立的鸟人栖息地，尽管许多人发现鸟人的建筑对没有翅膀的生物来说是有限制的。同样地，一些鸟人群体感到在繁荣的栖息地内太过拥挤，开始分散开来，在小的林地村庄内寻求庇护。即使在今天，选择生活在森林地面上的鸟人发现自己被鄙视了，因为在鸟人社会中，树冠上的生活被认为是正当的。",

										"随着火焰的蔓延，卑微的村民向过度扩张的栖息地卫队请求援助，但看到援助到达得太晚，甚至根本没有。更糟糕的是，多年之后，卑微人社区之间的分歧加剧了：那些在鸟人城市发现繁荣的人采用了栖息地居民的观点，而那些生活在林地的人则面临着来自强盗和森林火灾的持续威胁。其他人甚至已经离开，加入了新改革的强盗联盟，他们不仅看到了一条生存之路，还看到了与栖息在鸟人中的人报复违背誓言和不平等待遇的机会。然而，在条约生效的地方，仍然可以找到充满活力的卑微人社区。卑贱的人们具有顽强的生命力，每个种族都会想出办法在这片危险的森林中生存。",

										"随着阿迪雅和泰顿的诞生，世界开始运转。曾经除了荒地什么都没有的地方，随着阿玛兰斯人的到来，土地变得生机勃勃，世界开始了生与死的无尽循环。他们的到来将无形的天空分为白天和黑夜。他们创造了太阳和月亮，从他们在天上的运动中出现的光和暗的连续，告诉所有生命何时行动，何时休息。阿迪雅和泰坦从大节奏的不同部分诞生。每个人都知道对方的存在，但他们保持着各自的领域，只在黎明的早期和黄昏的晚期相遇，交换对天空的统治权。在温暖的季节，阿迪亚对天空有更大的统治权，而在严寒的季节，泰坦的力量会增加。",
										"两位阿玛兰特人创造了汉伯伍德的大部分生活。阿迪雅用喜欢阳光的花草和动物充实了白天，而泰顿则用拥抱黑暗的昆虫和动物洗礼了夜晚。他们孕育了有知觉的种族，所有的鸟人都是从他们那里起源的，他们的第一个孩子，不久之后就是谦卑人。",
										"本来，所有的鸟人都是一样的。很难将他们与森林中的鸟类区分开来，因为他们甚至拥有飞行的能力。有一天，整个鸟人群体决定进行一场盛大的送礼比赛，以证明他们中谁最有资格领导。阿迪雅同意担任裁判；谁能给她送上最大的礼物，谁就能成为她孩子中的领袖。在一整个季节里，鸟民们寻找和搜刮，收集和猎取，带着小饰品、小玩意、大小礼物回来。虽然阿迪雅赞扬了她所有孩子的礼物，但只有五个孩子真正值得她的恩赐。",
										"Gesme、Reya、Hanera、Altus和Clhuran：这五个人成为鸟人的领袖。他们激发了故事、奉献精神，并赋予鸟人种族以独特的形式和技能。这些伟大的人继续成为大节奏的一部分，作为自然平衡的守护者和整个Everden的鸟人的保护者，最终上升并加入Amaranthine。五个人的追随者都被赋予了新的形式和伟大的礼物，以配合他们领袖的功绩。然而，要接受这些礼物，需要失去一些东西。这就是为什么今天的鸟人只能滑翔：他们的飞行天赋被当作成为新事物的代价。"

										"其他鸟人嘲笑Gesme，因为她花了好几天时间来策划，并阅读天空。她检查每一棵树，从大白蜡到柔软的柳树。每天她都用嘴叼着一根新的树枝，沮丧地扔下许多树枝。鸟人不解，但对她的行为不以为然。然后，有一天黎明时分，当太阳在天空中处于最低点时，Gesme出现了，嘴里叼着一根橡树枝。她一言不发，直接飞向地平线。她似乎飞了很久，但橡树枝很轻，并没有给她带来麻烦。当她接近太阳时，她的羽毛、爪子和喙开始在高温下变黑。不过，她还是坚持了下来。橡树很坚韧，很有活力，没有枯萎。最后，她把树枝的顶端伸进太阳，点燃了它。她急忙向地面飞去，树枝在她的爪子里燃烧着。橡树很有耐心，没有被烧毁，当Gesme从天上回来时，它保持了火焰的稳定。",
										"\"看看我带来了什么！\"她吹嘘道，因为那些惊愕的鸟人看着她烧焦的羽毛。\"这将使我们在寒冷的冬日里保持温暖，并安全度过漫长的夜晚！\"",
										"Ardea起初对世界上出现的火感到担忧，因为她知道森林会燃烧，而且滥用火会给Everden带来伤害。但是，当她看到鸟人聚集在火堆周围，感受到小火苗能给她的孩子们带来的温和温暖时，她被幸福所征服。",
										"\"这，\"她宣称，\"是值得夸奖的。\"",
										"因此，Gesme被改变了。她被知识和创造力的火焰点燃了，成为了一名阿马兰斯人。她的追随者们的形态也发生了变化，他们成为第一批科沃姆人。他们被赋予了她的聪明才智和远见卓识，但阿迪亚给了他们所有的黑色爪子、羽毛和喙，以提醒他们格斯梅为将火种带入世界而付出的代价。"

										"在她的一次旅行中，雷亚遇到了一个陌生人。这个旅行者的真实形态隐藏在斗篷下，但他们可以飞行，显然在树上的感觉和任何鸟人一样舒适。他们听说了雷亚在赛车、狩猎和在森林中导航方面的技能，并提出了三个挑战，雷亚同意了。",

										"雷亚鼓起全部力量跟上，以前所未有的方式拍打翅膀。然而，旅行者不断向前推进，而她无法及时缩小差距。",
										"雷亚为下一个挑战做好了准备。他们飞到草地上，那里有小动物在吃草，决定谁先抓到五只野兔谁就是赢家。雷亚带着目的前进，她相信没有人能够胜过她的弓箭技术，这是她自己创造的工具。她的每一次射击都找到了目标，直到她只剩下一只野兔可以捕捉。但当雷亚看向旅行者时，她震惊地看到他们带着满满的装备不耐烦地等待。",
										"在第三个也是最后一个项目中，两人飞到了森林的中心。第一个出现在外面的空地上的人将是胜利者。这些是雷亚熟悉的森林，她确信她会赢。然而，他们刚一开始，雷亚就看到旅行者下了车，像失重一样飞快地穿过树林。雷亚紧跟其后，用尽一切办法使自己获得优势。但旅行者仍然领先，即使只是几英寸，并取得了胜利。",
										"雷亚落在附近的一根树枝上，诅咒自己缺乏技巧。然而，在停顿了一会儿后，她恢复了平静，并感谢她的竞争者。然而，那个旅行者笑了，这个声音如此熟悉，雷亚想知道为什么她以前没有注意到。",
										"\"你没有什么可羞愧的，鸟人。我看到你的技能是真的。你是第一个在每项赛事中都如此接近我的人，而这并不容易。\" 旅行者脱下他们的斗篷，雷亚不敢相信自己的眼睛。她受到了风本身的挑战。",

										"因为她的慈善，哈内拉得到了阿马兰斯的恩惠：她的羽毛变成了绿色，长成了藤蔓和嫩芽，上面点缀着最美丽的花朵。其他鸟人敬畏地注视着，那些追随哈内拉的鸟人成为第一批胆小鬼，受到她鼓舞人心的善意的祝福，以及她与大地和所有生长物的亲密关系。"

										"\"如果我把她从来没有见过的东西送给阿迪雅，会怎么样？\"他想。\"是的！我将猎取月亮，把它送给她，让她看到它可爱的光芒。\" 这对任何其他鸟人来说都是不可想象的，但阿尔图斯很坚决，相信他的礼物会让阿迪雅高兴。",
										"然而，他既不像雷亚那样熟练和灵活，也不像格西姆那样聪明和狡猾。他的箭不会划伤月亮，尽管他有强大的力量，却无法移动它。但阿尔图斯很固执，许多个夜晚他都在尝试，但都没能打倒他的猎物。他越是努力，就越是沮丧。阿尔图斯甚至认为他能听到月亮的笑声映在潺潺的小溪和荡漾的池塘里，嘲笑他徒劳的努力。尽管如此，阿尔特斯仍然坚定不移。",
										"泰顿很感兴趣，在阿尔图斯挣扎时观察他。\"你为什么坚持这项任务，我的孩子？\"黑夜中的阿玛兰蒂恩问。\"你一定知道你不会成功。\"",
										"阿尔图斯回答说：\"如果我不尝试，那么我就永远无法确定我是否能做到。但你可能是对的。以我所有的力量，我永远无法战胜月亮，只有傻瓜才会拒绝承认他被战胜了。\" 阿尔图斯停顿了一下，发出一声叹息。\"可惜了，这本可以成为送给阿迪雅的一份可爱的礼物。\"",
										"泰顿被感动了，不仅仅是被这种情感所感动，也被这个鸟人的惊人意志所感动。",
										"\"你的决心为你赢得了荣誉。\"泰顿说。\"要捕获月亮，你需要这个。\" 他说着拿出一个有盖的圣杯，是用赤杨树的木头复杂地雕刻而成的。泰顿把它交给了阿尔图斯，然后黑夜中的阿马兰蒂恩消失了。",
										"阿尔图斯很疑惑，直到月亮从云层后面出现。他在身后的池塘里听到了它的笑声。当他转身时，他看到了：月亮的倒影完美地镶嵌在静止、清澈的水中。阿尔图斯毫不迟疑地将水注入了圣杯。月亮清晰地倒映在圣杯中，他迅速关上杯盖。月亮被抓住了。",
										"当黎明开始在地平线上破晓时，泰顿再次出现在阿尔图斯面前。\"让我的妹妹注视我的创造，但在白天结束前把它归还。夜晚需要它。\"老猫头鹰神父说，然后就离开了，前往生命之外的土地。",
										"就这样，阿尔图斯把月亮送给了阿尔迪亚。他成了第一个斯特里格人，他的人民得到了他强大的力量和不屈不挠的意志的恩赐。他遵守了对泰顿的誓言，当晚就把月亮还给了他。为此，泰顿赐予所有斯特里格人在月光下看得清楚的能力。泰顿欢迎阿尔图斯到他家做客，他家在死亡之地的深处。阿尔图斯发现那里的寒冷让人振奋，于是决定与埃弗登的人们分享它。这就是为什么冬天的天气如此恶劣；阿尔图斯每年都会回来，在他的酒杯里装着暴风雪，以测试鸟人的耐力。"

										"\"我应该关心别人对我的看法，\"他哈哈大笑，\"只要我快乐就好。\" 一些鸟人因为被他愚弄而感到痛苦，声称克赫兰不可能希望赢得这样一场比赛。克赫兰试图不理会他们，在他的心里，他觉得这些刺耳的声音击中了他的目标。",
										"\"我在骗谁呢？\"克赫兰叹了口气。\"我不强壮，也不聪明，没有技能，也没有领导能力......。我不可能创造出配得上Ardea的礼物。\" 带着这最后一个想法，他陷入了痛苦的忧郁之中。",

Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame.

This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them."

The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy."

								"The earth beneath Leya felt unusually warm. She reached down to confirm and pulled back in pain immediately. Her feathers were seared slightly. The season had been unusually dry, but this was a frightening temperature. After a closer look, it seemed like the ground was glowing.",
								"CRACK! Leya's eyes went to the sound. The large tree she'd played in as a child had fallen, and smoke rose from its remains. \"Go!\" her mind yelled, and she listened, rushing towards home. \"Get to them before\u2014\"",
								"Suddenly, flames burst forth, travelling at an unearthly velocity towards Leya's perch. Her perch meant the world to her, but in the vast expanse of the Wood it was small and unimportant. Too insignificant for a Perch Guard outpost of its own. Her heart tightened knowing the remote settlement wouldn't be warned in time, and that aid would not be close by.",
								"Leya's hands began to move without thought as she whispered the words of her grandmother. It wouldn't be enough, but she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she didn't try. When taught to her, the spell was meant to help farms through rainless seasons. It wasn't intended to be used defensively. Droplets of a lost cause formed between her fingers.",
								"Conjured water fell to the ground, evaporating as soon as it hit the steaming forest floor. As she concentrated, a strong warm gust touched Leya's face. It's Altus, it must be! Leya thought. The Amaranthine of storms was bringing rain to quench this hateful wildfire. She looked to the sky, frantically searching for more signs of changing weather.",
								"Barely able to register what she saw, her arms dropped to her sides in defeat. Flying balls of fire were filling up the sky. A swarm broke off, headed in her direction. Leya sank to her knees, hoping with her last thoughts that someone would save Humblewood before it all burned."

								"There have been disturbing signs over the last few months, signalling that something is wrong in Humblewood. The troubles appear to originate from activity in the Scorched Grove, an ashen plain that was ravaged many centuries ago by a destructive fire. Whatever caused the fire has scarred the land with elemental magic, making it inhospitable to all but strange fire-based creatures. Of late, the Grove has begun to expand. At first, it was hard to notice the slow expansion, but those in tune with nature (especially the Tenders) could see the imbalance in the elemental forces of Humblewood. For many common folk, this imbalance has been experienced as unseasonal dryness, which has led to crop failure and an increased frequency of forest fires. There have also been a number of unusually aggressive emberbat clouds reported far outside of their natural ranges.",
								"The true nature of the danger still remains hidden from the people of the Wood. A corvum necromancer named {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|Humblewood} has stirred the elemental {@creature aspect of fire|Humblewood}, which has lain dormant beneath the Scorched Grove since its first burning. The aspect's energies have begun to empower fire-based creatures within the Wood. The increased range of emberbat swarms have brought fires that have expanded the Grove. Many forest-dwellers, who have been left without homes, have turned to banditry to survive. Soon the elemental incarnation will break free, and players must find a way to stop the aspect of fire before it reduces the Wood to ashes."

Spurred by a new purpose, the criminal elements of the Coalition will be put to an end, and the organization will turn into a relief network for those displaced by the fires.",

While some members of the Coalition will abandon the cause for their own gains, many will be willing to help it transition into an organization dedicated to helping fight the spreading fires and provide relief and shelter to those in need. The Birdfolk Council will release a decree: they will become the Humblewood Council, and new representatives from major humblefolk villages in the regions and within Alderheart itself will be added to their numbers, effectively giving humblefolk across the Wood a voice in governance for the first time. This significant change will take the span of the adventure to resolve, but by the end, the Humblewood Council will lead the way to a new era of unity in Humblewood. Now dedicated to peace, Benna will show her gratitude by presenting the party with the {@item blade of the wood|Humblewood} she once wielded.",

Many will lose hope and desert without Benna, but others will see her as a martyr and rally under a surviving captain. Members will work from safehouses in the forests, doing their best to keep the Coalition command structure intact, and continue to cause problems for the Wood after the events of this adventure. Perhaps peace can be achieved someday, when the wounds of losing their beloved leader aren't so fresh. But, without Benna, the Coalition won't trust or treat with outsiders.",

The Council will happily grant this boon to the party as they have proven themselves to be valuable allies and defenders of the realm. A small contingent of guards and hirelings from the Birdfolk Council will oversee the upkeep and protection of the fortress while the party is away.

The creatures hesitate for a moment, until another more powerful tremor shakes even their massive bodies. The ashsnakes flee, heading south and burrowing into the ash. The tremors continue to gain in momentum and intensity. To the north, miles away, something gigantic rises from a bed of cinders. First a hill, then a small mountain, releasing a plume of ash that blocks the sun. As the dust clouds settle, you see a huge creature made of craggy black rock and pulsing orange magma. It bellows a guttural sound unlike anything you've ever heard and begins to march toward your position."

								"The {@creature aspect of fire|Humblewood} is a primeval elemental whose very being thrums with rage. Try to avoid calling it the \"aspect of fire\" in front of your players, as this creature is currently unknown to them. If a character wants to make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to see if they know of it, a roll of 16 or higher would be enough for them to have heard of the aspect of fire through scant tales and myths. The stories say that this creature's sole desire is to consume, heedless of the destruction it leaves in its wake. Characters would not know anything more than this.",
								"The aspect will immediately sense the party of intruders in its Grove, and make for them at full speed. It's obvious from the size and power of this creature that taking it on would be folly. Be sure to communicate this to the players. However, any party member who stays to make a noble sacrifice will surely buy time for their companions to escape.",
								"The party can make whatever plans they want, but the shortest distance out of the aspect's path is back into the forest toward Alderheart. Any other path out of the Grove would leave them exposed to the aspect's march or ashsnakes that could be following. The forest canopy should also provide some cover from the creature, making the party difficult to target.",
								"Tevor will flee immediately into the forest, making his escape before the party can react. This is the simplest way to resolve the matter, but if it makes sense within the story, you can have Tevor sacrifice himself to buy the party time to escape, or to save a party member in the following chase sequence.",
								"Have the players describe how they would make their way to safety. The easiest way to resolve this would be to have each character make a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity ({@skill Athletics}) check to attempt to outrun the aspect. Allow players to make different ability checks if they can come up with a unique way for their characters to escape the threat. For example, distracting the creature might be somewhat of a challenge, requiring a DC 14 Charisma or Intelligence ({@skill Deception}) check, but attempting to restrain it would be more difficult.",
								"Once they have succeeded on the first skill check, have each player make another skill check to determine how successful they are at fleeing as the creature continues to move toward them. Make this check easier or harder depending on how well players did on the first check. If players succeed at this check, their character flees at a sufficiently quick pace to avoid being in range of the creature's attacks. Particularly dire failures on this check could result in characters falling {@condition prone}.",
								"As the aspect marches, it indiscriminately hurls massive boulders of magma and rock into the forest. Characters who failed the second skill check have fallen behind and are in range of these attacks. They must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw at the start of each round. On a failure, they take 16 ({@dice 3d10}) fire damage. On a success, they take half that damage. They may then attempt another skill or ability check to flee out of the creature's range. As above, be flexible here, and try to reward players for creativity while keeping the threat to their characters believable.",
								"After about two rounds of pursuit, the characters should notice that the aspect isn't gaining as quickly, and after another round the characters will all have made it out of the creature's range regardless. If any look back, all they will see is an ominous red glow through the trees, and a plume of thick smoke rising up over the horizon. From here the characters are free to make their way safely into the forest and back to Alderheart."

He is condescending to the party at every opportunity. He is arrogant, and doesn't think the Defenders of Alderheart could possibly understand what he sees as necessary steps to stop the aspect.
