From a 21st-century point of view, this means devices, machines, vehicles, robots, computers, weapons, satellites, drugs, and so on. But it also means bioengineered creatures, cybernetic beings, and creatures brought here from alien worlds in other solar systems, or dimensions beyond those typically understood to be part of cosmology. In other words, it's not just high tech, but also devices that surpass even our 21st-century understanding\u2014things that manipulate time, space, gravity, and more.",
								"However, it's important to remember that the player characters don't look at the numenera the way that 21st-century people look at technology. In a fantasy world, a force field projector and a two-way radio would seem not only like magic, but magic of the same level of power. In fact, the radio might seem more potent because its use is broader, and its effects are \"invisible.\" Characters with a medieval sensibility have no perspective on what sorts of technology are more advanced than others, and they take none of it for granted.",
								"The same is likely true of many of the creatures presented in {@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA}. Commoners will likely think that most of them are simply \"demons.\" PC adventurers will likely learn differently, but the average villager, townsperson, trader, or guard in a fantasy setting doesn't have the knowledge or perspective to imagine that a thing nearly 20 feet tall that hungers for flesh is anything other than a supernatural beast of pure evil. But in truth, this thing\u2014in this case a {@creature jiraskar|AotA}\u2014is not a demon in the planar sense, but actually an apex predator, one of many somehow transported from the Ancients' time. Despite their size, they are animals. But the dangers that these creatures pose make a commoner's perceptions understandable. The concept of a demon\u2014a spiritually evil entity\u2014is a label for threats that can't be understood. To lump all creatures that hunger for flesh and hunt humans together as demons is clearly simplistic. Worse, doing so probably robs locals of potential strategies for dealing with such a creature.

For example, as an action you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself, or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet. Any telekinetic action that would require a Strength check uses your Intelligence. This mutation lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it's not a means of attack. You can't use this mutation to move your own body or anything you are holding or carrying. The power lasts for one hour. After you've used telekinesis for an hour, it has disadvantage until you complete a short or long rest."

You can't pass through barriers made of energy (such as wall of fire) or force. After you use phase shifting, you have disadvantage on all rolls until you complete a short or long rest. If you use phaseshifting while you have disadvantage from it, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest."

For an uncommon item, adding 1 charge (or one use for a depleted relic) costs 1 Hit Die, a rare item costs 2 Hit Dice, a very rare item costs 3 Hit Dice, and a legendary item costs 4 Hit Dice. After you've used this mutation, you have disadvantage on all Intelligence rolls and can't use it again until you've completed a short or long rest."
				],
				[
					"95\u201396",

The number of hit points you regain depends on the rarity of the device or relic: {@dice 1d8} for common or uncommon, {@dice 2d8} for rare, {@dice 3d8} for very rare, or {@dice 5d8} for legendary. You recover these hit points at a rate of {@dice 1d8} per round, and you must use your action each round and maintain concentration; if you are interrupted, the healing ends. This completely drains the device, even if interrupted before you're finished (at the GM's discretion, an item may retain some charges or only have to make a depletion roll if partially drained). Because you need to maintain contact and concentration with the item to use this ability, it is all but impossible to use it on an item held or worn by an unwilling creature."

									"Killisti hate and fear a fair fight. They set ambushes and traps whenever possible. Traps usually consist of spiked pits, tripwires, or spine-filled nets. Any sharp points in their traps are poisoned. Most killisti carry long knives and crude bows. These weapons are always freshly envenomed from the poison-seeping slits in their sides.",
									"A band of killisti might set up an ambush at a bridge or along a road. They might even \"bait\" that trap with one of their number pretending to be hurt or dead at the center of the ambush. Other killisti may live on the edges of civilized areas, stealing what they need and preying upon those weaker than themselves. For example, a town with an infestation of killisti might start to experience disappearances among children or the elderly."

This material provides statistics for various simple automatons that adventurers might encounter during a campaign. These stat blocks can be used to represent almost any kind of uninteresting automaton-servant units that prepare or serve food, crafting units that build basic structures out of stone or wood, scouts that patrol an area, guardians that protect a creature or location, and so on. The GM can customize them by adjusting size, stats, specifying what form its attacks take (claws, slams, and so on), adding manufactured weapons (swords, rays, or even cyphers or relics), different movement modes, skill bonuses, or even a special ability. These changes should be limited so the GM doesn't have to adjust the automaton's challenge rating. For example, the basic automaton's listed melee attack method is just called \"melee attack\"; it doesn't matter if that's a claw, drill, or blade, and the GM can use the listed attack stats for whatever weapon they decide the automaton is using. Depending on the automaton's role, it may not have more than one attack type (a chef automaton might attack with a built-in chopping knife but not have any way to make ranged attacks). The following creature stat listings cover the five most common types of basic automatons.",
