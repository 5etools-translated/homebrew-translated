						"Wizards of the Coast announced the Fantasy Setting Search in 2002: a call for a new world for Dungeons & Dragons. They received thousands of entries, including my world--which would ultimately become Eberron. I worked with James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins, and many more to develop my original idea into Eberron as you know it today.",
						"I'm extremely proud of the world we've created. However, there are elements I love that I've never had the opportunity to explore in an official book. When first designing the world, I included aquatic nations--considering the civilizations that the merfolk, sahuagin, and other intelligent undersea species might build. We developed a unique system of planes for Eberron, something with a very different flavor than the well-established Great Wheel. We presented the idea of a proud empire of goblinoids that ruled Khorvaire long before humanity arrived. But there are only so many pages in any sourcebook, and these ideas had to be trimmed down--or in some cases, cut entirely--in our original {@i Eberron Campaign Setting.} The planes exist, but there was never enough space to describe them in more than a paragraph apiece, which isn't nearly enough to understand what makes Fernia different from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or how you might set an adventure in Mabar. From canon material, we know the sahuagin exist and have ambassadors in Stormreach, but nothing is revealed about their civilizations.",
						"From the very beginning, I hoped that we might see a {@i Planes of Eberron} sourcebook, but it never came to pass--and when Eberron returned in the fourth and fifth editions of D&D, sourcebooks needed to prioritize the key foundations of the setting, and didn't have space to explore these hidden corners. So while I've always had dreams of Droaam and the planes in my head, Eberron is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, and only they could publish new Eberron material. That all changed in 2018, when Wizards of the Coast worked with me to create the {@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}, a PDF supplement released on the Dungeon Masters Guild website... and with that release, they made it possible, for the first time in Eberron's history, for anyone to create new content for Eberron through the Dungeon Masters Guild. The next year, in creating {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}--the official fifth-edition hardcover--the design team expanded on the story of the Mror dwarves. But once again, there wasn't enough room to focus on their conflict with the daelkyr and the mystery of the Realm Below.",
						"That's where Wayne Chang, who works with me on the podcast {@i Manifest Zone}, entered the picture. Together, we sketched out a plan for a book that delves into many of the topics I've always wanted to explore--the planes, the Dhakaani, and undersea nations--as well as a few more recent developments, like the Mror. And so, this book was born!",
						"事实证明，写一本这么大的书是一个（%0%）的工作量。劳拉-赫斯布鲁纳作为编辑和版面设计师完成了艰巨的任务，而威尔-布罗利则开发了令人沉浸的怪物、魔法物品、原型等等。由于在真空中工作是窒息而死的好方法，我非常感谢劳拉、韦恩和威尔，他们一直是我的反馈和灵感的来源。",
						"We also worked with a host of artists to develop original art for this book. From Katerina Poliakova's wonderful portrait of Tira Miron, which opens chapter 3, to Marco Bernardini's amazing planar map with its miniature views of every plane, it's been thrilling to see these unexplored aspects of the world come to life. In some instances, to convey a concept to an artist, I put my own limited artistic skills to work. Below is my first draft of a sahuagin city built around one of the slumbering kar'lassa--and in chapter 4, you can see how Vincentius Matthew made sense of my sketch!",
						"I'd be remiss if I didn't also call out the community of Eberron players, DMs, and creators who are all keeping Eberron alive--including our excellent playtesters! And, of course, my brilliant wife, creative partner, and co-founder of Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis--who is always willing to have a conversation about undercover shark people or tourist attractions on the Plane of Peace.",
						"Before I lay this book before you, one disclaimer: This is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You'll find a few details that don't align with previous sourcebooks; it's up to you to decide which to use. But remember that there's always a third option: using {@i your} answer. From the beginning, nearly two decades ago now--when we chose not to present the cause of the Mourning or reveal the powers of the Mark of Death--we wanted Eberron to {@i inspire} players and Dungeon Masters, not to limit them. This is a book of ideas for you to build upon--and some, you might even ignore. This presents {@i my} Eberron, but I'm always thrilled to see people making the world their own.",
						"And now--Eberron awaits!",

The purging of lycanthropes early in the ninth century strains relations between humanity and shifters.

As the immortal overlords couldn't be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords.

It's commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons--for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix. It's up to the DM to decide the truth, but it could be possible for adventurers to find places or relics tied to the Sovereigns from this age. You might find the lance Dol Arrah used when battling Katashka the Gatekeeper, or the site where she and Dol Dorn flayed the Mockery for his treachery. Whether tied to gods or dragons, these sites and relics still hold power.",

												"每位霸主只有在 \"龙族预言 \"的某个特定段落实现后才能被释放。被称为 \"尘埃领主 \"的恶魔们致力于发现和实施这些预言，而商会的龙则试图阻止他们。双方都经常利用凡人作为棋子，所以冒险者很容易发现自己被卷入了这些计划。当他们达到更高的水平时，冒险者甚至可能成为这场斗争的积极参与者，而不是单纯的棋子。虽然很少有凡人意识到这一点，但这是一场决定世界命运的持续冷战。",

They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen'drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler's Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen'drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du'rashka Tul--\"the madness of crowds\"--causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness.

In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows--the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future. Cyre's motto captures the heart of this nation and its people: \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create.\"",

Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King's Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together--the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the {@item everbright lantern|ERLW}, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece--a city of wonders--this principle was applied across central Cyre.

But in the old kingdom of Metrol--which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland--the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre's dream.

														"--now Valenar--was effectively a separate nation with a dramatically different culture and values. It was arguably Galifar's greatest failing. The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of Valenar; first and foremost, it's because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called \"thrones\"), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime."

										"Under the reign of King Jarot, Cyre continued to shine. Aspiring artists and young nobles made their way to the heart of the kingdom, while the most promising artificers settled in the city of Making. King Jarot lavished attention on Cyre--expanding the Vermishard Palace, working with House Orien to expand the lightning rail within Cyre, and spending hundreds of thousands of galifars on the Wynarn Institute of Art and the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host.",
										"Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of Karrnath or Thrane. Cyre's finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to House Cannith, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, Thrane is a paladin, Karrnath is a fighter, Aundair is a wizard, and Breland is a rogue. In this party, Cyre is the bard--elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything... but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.",
										"Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar's treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be--and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given. Now the Arcane Congress devoted its knowledge purely to the good of Aundair, Rekkenmark trained only Karrns, and the King's Citadel served Breland. Yes, Cyre had echoes of all these things. Its wizards were still a match for any nation other than Aundair, and the Vermishard Guard formed the core of Cyre's new military academy. But it was clear that the Cyran dream had been sustained by many hands, and now the nation had to learn to stand on its own."

												"The oldest traveler tradition is that of the Children of Jes. Inspired by the Traveler, the Children follow migratory patterns that slowly evolve, keeping them from becoming too predictable to outsiders. Many travel in small groups--a troupe of entertainers, a merchant convoy, a stagecoach of exotic travelers. Others prefer to travel alone. Regardless, they believe in the importance of change, taking on many personas during their wanderings. Tinker, bard, courier, and priest are common roles, and the changeling might well be quite talented at their trade. Traveler priests can preach a sermon to the Host in the morning and lead Flamesong in the evening. As they conceal their true changeling nature, Children are usually invisible to the people around them; they use a secret language of tattoos and scars to identify one another, along with a set of shared personas.",
												"Few people in the Five Nations understand the culture and values held by changeling travelers. Some are unnerved by the concept of a hidden culture, that a stranger might not be the human or hobgoblin they appear to be. Others assume that because changelings have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that they will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on. Changeling traditions predate Galifar and its laws, and indeed, some deem it fair to \"obtain\" another's possessions as long as they're replaced with a gift of equal value. And a few travelers assert the Traveler's blessing is their license to prey on the \"single-skins\"--a term for races lacking the changeling gift for shapeshifting. However, travelers are no more innately dishonest than any other people--whether dragonmarked heir or Gatekeeper druid--though those that respect local customs are still subject to much suspicion due to their shapeshifting abilities and nomadic preferences.",

This allows them to sell their services openly and to pursue careers that make use of their unique talents, as explored in the \"Changeling Careers\" sidebar.

The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones--such as the one in Shae Mordai--but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn't rely on faith; there's no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people--from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive."

While dormant, the spirit within the idol is unaware of the outside world or the passage of time, existing in an ongoing trance--a dreamlike existence built from memories and personal experiences. A {@i spirit idol} can be awakened with the {@spell speak with dead} spell, though some remain conscious indefinitely and can be found serving as tutors, provosts, and judges.",

For many Aereni, their greatest goal in life is to gather the memories and ideas that will be their companions in their eternal trance after death.",

The common dead are embalmed after death and interred in the vast catacombs below the land, along with a record of their life. Only those who have committed truly heinous crimes--such as grave robbers--are denied memory; such criminals are burned after death, their ashes scattered in the oceans, with no records kept of their lives."

An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren't trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan's goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters--and in Aerenal, they're still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a very rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it's a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of common and uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still. You've never been encouraged to innovate; you've been taught that {@i the old ways are the best ways}. Do you agree with this?"

Each region of the country (save for the northern territory of the Tairnadal) is governed by a noble line. The original settlers of Aerenal came from different cultures and environments, and the lines represent this; while all are united by the common customs of Aerenal, each line has its own unique fashions and traditions. A line is an alliance of ancient families governed by a noble house that carries the name of the line. Thus, \"the line of Mendyrian\" refers to multiple families, but someone who uses the surname--such as Belaereth Mendyrian--is a member of the noble line. The noble line represents the best of the region; it's not a hereditary family, but rather, a meritocracy whose members are chosen from the people of the region. Similarly, the Sibling Kings--the rulers of the united kingdom--are members of the same line and symbolically brother and sister, but they aren't blood relatives. So in life, elves aspire to be appointed to their noble line; in death, they hope to be raised to the Undying Court.",

Now that I've embraced the light, I can't bear to carry the weight of war on my shoulders.\"} It's important to maintain game balance, even if it means overlooking a few blips in the story. But changing beliefs can be a good reason for a dramatic mechanical shift within a character. Ultimately, your beliefs--or lack thereof--don't have to be limited by a class choice you made at 1st level. Whether it's ultimately strengthened or abandoned, questioning and exploring faith can be an interesting path for any character."

And like Keeper Danth, Melysse was shockingly able to wield the power of the fountain of fire in Flamekeep, performing miracles no lesser priest could match. This triggered a deep schism that lasted for years, until Melysse was finally revealed to be the chosen hand of the Shadow in the Flame--it was not the Silver Flame, but rather the overlord Bel Shalor, that strengthened her in Flamekeep. Because of the fear that her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose a new AntiKeeper, Melysse wasn't killed; instead, she was petrified and placed in Dreadhold, where she remains to this day.",

This served as justification for the foreign templars who fought against Thrane in the Last War; they argued that they continued to respect the spiritual authority of the Keeper, but that the church shouldn't rule a reunited Galifar. The priests of Stormreach went so far as to condemn the theocracy and Keeper Serrain.

Modern Seeker scholars debate the origins of the name, whether Vol was an individual or a group of people, or related to the elven line at all.

												"As a divine spellcaster who follows the Blood of Vol, you believe that your power comes from your own soul. As a paladin, you are calling on the power of your own blood when you heal your allies or smite your enemies. The visible manifestations of magic of the Blood of Vol typically involve crimson energy, as if luminous tendrils of blood are flowing from you. But it's not simply your power. Consider the Seeker priest who casts {@spell commune}; how can they gain information they don't already know? The answer is that the divinity within is something far greater than you. It is a god, possessing celestial power you can't understand or imagine--but it is still in its chrysalis, waiting to be born. When you cast your spell, you awaken a sliver of its power; once the spell is done, it returns to its rest.",

Scholars of other faiths argue that the Seekers are deluded, that their powers are simply drawn from some other source, the same kind of delusion that allows a warforged cleric to draw magic from their devotion to the Lord of Blades.

											"page": 58,
											"entries": [
												"The Blood of Vol emerged from collaboration with Aereni necromancers, and the undead have always been associated with the faith. First and foremost, this link is born out of practicality. Seekers have no reverence for corpses; the divinity within is tied to life and to the soul, and once those things are gone, what's left is just meat and bone. As an extension of this, most Seekers want their corpses to be put to use. The faith is driven by the idea of serving a community--why let your corpse go to waste when it can help your friends and family? As such, mindless undead are commonly seen in Seeker communities serving as guardians, performing manual labor, and completing other simple tasks.",
												"However, a common misconception is that Seekers want to become undead. Some do, driven purely by the fear of oblivion, but undeath is a miserable half-life, not a triumph. The divinity within is bound to your blood and your soul, so Seekers believe that the souls of undead are trapped in their corpses, the spark of divinity lost to them. Those who embrace undeath are seen as martyrs, and generally expected to protect and serve their Seeker community. One of the most public of these champions is the mummy lord Malevanor, the high priest of Atur. The former high priest of Atur was the mummy Askalor, who held the post for over four hundred years--but he was weary of his long undead existence. When Malevanor was grievously injured during the Last War, Askalor transferred his power and his undead existence to his apprentice. This raises an interesting question: if the divinity within lies in the blood, how does Malevanor cast divine magic? The answer is that Seeker communities ritually draw their blood and share it with these champions. Vampires drink this blood, while mummies or liches may bathe in it. Through this, undead priests draw their power from the blood of the living faithful.",
												"Another factor in the long association between the Blood of Vol and necromancy is that Seeker communities have often formed in or near manifest zones to Mabar. While such areas are often inhospitable or dangerous, over the course of many centuries, Seekers have learned how to tap the energies of these places. Because Mabaran manifest zones are usually blighted, outsiders often accuse the Seekers of causing blights. In reality, the Seekers often perform rituals that limit the negative effects of the manifest zones--so instead of causing the plagues and blights associated with Mabar, they often prevent them."

												"If the power of the Blood of Vol flows from within, who answers when a cleric conjures a celestial or invokes {@spell planar ally}? One simple answer is for the DM to use a being who has the statistics of a celestial or fiend, but that is formed from blood and magic; it's a manifestation of your own divine essence and fades away when its work is done. This might seem a strange match for {@spell planar ally}, a spell that normally requires payment to an external force, but even an ally of your own essence might demand a service in return. This could be seen as a request from your subconscious--a demand that you do something you know you should do, but that you've been trying to ignore. On the other hand, it could be a mysterious task with no discernible purpose; this ties to the fact that your Divinity Within is something beyond mere mortal understanding, and you don't fully understand what it needs or wants.",
												"另一种可能性是，你在利用探索者群体，而不是向各星球寻求援助。信仰的一个原则是，冠军会变成不死之身，以便他们能帮助其他探索者。当你施展{@spell planar ally}时，你可能会召唤一个你信仰的不死战士，而不是召唤一个天神或魔鬼；这可能是任何东西，从吸血鬼到木乃伊领主或死亡骑士。在这种情况下，他们要求的报酬很可能是对他们所隶属的探索者神庙的什一税。在一个较小的范围内，你的管理员也可以决定，当你施放{@spell conjure celestial}时，它会召唤出一个讽刺的火焰骷髅，而不是一个天使。"

												"Some of this is a natural process of syncretism. The Marcher orcs blended their original beliefs with the traditions of human settlers. But the Talenta were telling their stories before they ever encountered humanity. Though scholars debate the reason why, most agree that the more similar a tradition is to an archetypal Sovereign, the easier it is to draw divine power from that faith. A culture that invokes a deity of the hunt is more likely to produce clerics and paladins than a culture that worships a giant salmon of the same name--and if the deity's name is similar to \"Balinor,\" the connection to divine magic will be easier still. Vassals sages assert that this proves the existence of the Sovereigns, while skeptics say it could simply be a numbers game--it's easier to draw power from a shared belief, and belief in the Sovereigns has reached critical mass.",

The church is very focused on wealth and economic power; members are expected to contribute to the hoard of their local temple, and the priests often engage in behavior that outsiders might consider to be corrupt. They hold the unorthodox belief that mortals can ascend to become Sovereigns themselves--that by emulating a particular Sovereign, a mortal can eventually take their place. Popular rumor holds that the founder of the Library of Korranberg, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran, built the library as part of a quest to assume the mantle of Aureon. While this Sovereign ascension is believed to occur after death, some priests teach that devoted members--especially those who donate great sums to the temple hoard--can actually become dragons in life.

One of a priest's most important duties is helping bereaved choose appropriate grave goods or sacrifices sufficient to distract the Keeper and ensure the deceased's soul reaches Dolurrh.

Thus, while the Restful Watch primarily reveres Aureon, they also understand and respect the Keeper, and believe that he serves a vital purpose.",

Many in House Cannith believe that Aaren d'Cannith--the inventor of the warforged--was a Traveler cultist; others assume that the Mourning may have been the work of a Cannith heir following the path of the Traveler.",
												"Some who follow the Traveler are tricksters, causing chaos with no clear agenda. But others see themselves as guides, playing tricks on people in order to teach them lessons. Guides seek to challenge established traditions, laws, or institutions--not necessarily to destroy them, but to ensure that they haven't outlived their usefulness. Still others are wanderers, embracing a life of constant change. The changeling travelers described in chapter 2 fall into this category, believing that as long as they remain in motion, the Traveler will guide and protect them. Ultimately, the Traveler will throw your life into chaos--for it's by adapting to this chaos that people grow."

								"The title \"Cult of the Dragon Below\" is a blanket term used to describe any sect that serves a malevolent power or has bizarre beliefs that defy rational thought. But no member of such an organization would call themselves a \"cultist of the Dragon Below.\" As a true believer, you might be a blessed eye of the All-Seer, a pilgrim on the road to the Inner Sun, or a warlock in the court of the Queen of Shadows. If you're a member of one of these three cults, you don't see the other two as allies, for they're clearly dangerous and delusional. And while outsiders may be able to guess what force is behind the cult--it doesn't take a Korranberg sage to guess that the people growing eyes on their hands might be tied to Belashyrra--only a fraction of the cults of the Dragon Below knowingly serve a daelkyr or overlord.",
								"Cults of the Dragon Below are categorized by two elements: structure and power. The structure defines the shape and scale of a cult, while the power is the malevolent force behind it, usually a daelkyr or fiendish overlord. The {@table Cults of the Dragon Below|ExploringEberron} table provides a few examples of cults--simply scratching the surface of what can appear in the world--and the rest of the section explores these elements in more detail.",

										"{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} has tribes of barbarians clamoring to spill blood in his name in the Demon Wastes. He has loyalists in the Five Nations subtly spreading hatred and ignorance. And he produces revenants, innocents who wake up convinced they are reincarnated soldiers with a duty to complete unfinished battles. This is common--most overlords and daelkyr have multiple cults, each completely unaware of another. While each cult is unique, most fall into one of the following three categories.",

												"Members of these cults are united by shared delusions, the reality of their minds corrupted by a horrifying alien force. Sometimes the delusion infects those who take part in the rituals; other times the ideas first leak into people's minds, then draw them to the cult. This is why the cults of the Dragon Below can never be wiped out, and why they can appear anywhere--you never know when or where an irrational idea can take root, twisting the thoughts and beliefs of innocent people.",
												"While a corrupted cult's beliefs and actions may seem irrational to outsiders, to members of the cult they make perfect sense. A revenant truly believes they are a legendary hero reincarnated. A Vigilant Eye cultist believes they've been given blessed vision that reveals evildoers who must die. The fact the cultist has grown a new eye doesn't seem strange to them--{@i it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.} Corrupted cultists may see the world differently than people around them. A group of revenants could be working with a mind flayer and dolgrims, but they see these aberrations as loyal knights tied to their ancient order. When encountering a corrupted cult, player characters will face the challenge of making sense of the delusion--understanding what the cult members believe they're trying to accomplish, and how it relates to what they're actually doing. These delusions have nothing to do with mental illness and cannot be treated at a Jorasco healing house. This is a form of supernatural influence with a specific cause--a corrupting alien entity--and with a specific effect; corruption can take hold of anyone at any time, and cultists may otherwise appear perfectly healthy and sane.",
												"Corrupted cults rarely last long. They typically come into existence with a clear purpose, a specific scheme that somehow benefits their guiding power. After this scheme succeeds or fails, the driving force often abandons the survivors. The question is whether this releases cultists from the delusion, or whether they are simply abandoned--or even driven toward destructive acts. A second important question is whether it's possible to free a cultist from their delusion while the cult is still active. This could require magic, such as {@spell greater restoration}. But it could simply require the cultist to be isolated from their allies and deprogrammed, or perhaps separated from an item that is reinforcing the delusion. If this powerful delusion can be broken, perhaps the cultist's original identity can reassert itself.",
												"腐败的邪教背后的力量并不总是很明显。忠诚者知道他们所服务的力量，并经常自豪地宣扬它，但许多其他被腐蚀的邪教并不清楚他们背后的力量。警惕之眼的邪教徒可能误以为他们被祝福的眼睛是奥瑞恩的礼物，而复仇者可能认为多尔-阿拉赫把他们还给了世界。即使邪教徒们自己没有意识到他们为谁服务，但他们的外衣也会让人看出来。Belashyrra的邪教徒经常与眼睛或持灵者打交道，Dyrrn雇佣了illithids和二重身，而Kyrzin的邪教徒通常与渗出物和粘液有关。但有时一个邪教可以显得非常无辜。你完全确定那个复仇者（%0%）是由多尔-亚拉恢复的吗？"

												"There are cults far older than any human civilization. Their strongholds are in desolate regions--the Demon Wastes, the Shadow Marches--but immigrants have carried these beliefs into the Five Nations. The members of these cults have been raised to believe that the traditions of their faith are normal. {@i You remember when your grandmother was consumed by the gibbering mouther in the basement. What's wrong with that? It was her time and her passage to immortality; you've heard her speaking to you in the whispers of the mouther. You hope that you'll live long enough to join her in its bowels.}",
												"Traditional cultists are typically less volatile and extreme than corrupted cultists; surviving long enough to become a tradition means avoiding reckless behavior and learning to keep your faith hidden from strangers. Many traditional cults can seem harmless; for the most part, Whisperers have no interest in harming or interacting with outsiders. However, traditional cults provide a lurking support network that can be activated when needed. {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} has loyalists hidden throughout the armies of the Five Nations, always ready to escalate violent situations. And a town could be filled with followers of the Transcendent Flesh who appear completely harmless and mundane--until the Night of Six Moons, when they all attach their symbionts and tear apart any outsiders unlucky enough to be in the town that night.",
												"Traditional cults are less extreme than corrupted ones, but they still see the world through a strange lens, despite knowing the power they're bound to. Some traditional cults believe their patrons are simply misunderstood--{@i Dyrrn seeks to elevate humanity, not to corrupt it!} Others celebrate the destructive or chaotic aspects of their patrons, either believing that this corrupt world deserves to be torn down, or that the faithful will be elevated in the next age. Even a cultist who reveres {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} may not be evil; they could believe the corrupt world must be washed in blood to cleanse evil, and aside from their duties to the Orphan King, they may be gentle and altruistic."

										"Corrupted cults usually have some sort of immediate goal that drives the formation and expansion of the cult. {@i The Vigilant Eye is hunting down \"demons\" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!} The goals are often terrible things that must be stopped, but it's not always obvious how they are helping the power behind the cult; these schemes may have nothing to do with the seals of the daelkyr or releasing an overlord. In the case of an overlord, the archfiends gain strength by driving mortals down their paths. For {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, getting mortals to use magic for malevolence strengthens her regardless of what they actually do; likewise, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} revels in all violence. Meanwhile, the daelkyr are truly incomprehensible. They certainly enjoy experimenting with their preferred mediums; one of {@creature dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn's} cults could enact a ritual that causes dragonmarks to come to life and attack their bearers, with no purpose beyond satisfying Dyrrn's curiosity. As the daelkyr experience time in a nonlinear fashion, it's also possible that what seems like meaningless chaos could have a unforeseen future--that there will come a time when a living dragonmark unleashed in the cult's bizarre rampage ends up being the vital element needed to defeat one of the Lords of Dust. The key point is that cults of the Dragon Below--particularly corrupted cults--may not have long-term plans; their schemes can and should often appear nonsensical.",
										"Traditional cults are religions. They aren't driven by short term goals, but instead provide guidelines on how to live your whole life. Traditional cults can be peaceful and innocuous... until they aren't. A particular alignment of moons, a vision sent to the cult leader, a critical mass of outsiders arriving at the same time--any cult could have a set of circumstances that trigger bloody rituals or brutal sacrifices. This is where the absurdity of a traditional cult rises to the surface. The people of Lowholt couldn't be kinder--until the flesh barn runs low on spleen and they have to harvest your organs. {@i It's a real shame, stranger, but our grandparents have to have that spleen}--the \"grandparents\" in this case being the gibbering mouther in the basement.",
										"Transactional cults are often initially driven by the desires of the members. Someone joins a transactional cult because they want the power to do something--to take revenge on their enemies, to overthrow a tyrant, to destroy a local criminal gang. But the patron always has a price, and this can eventually follow the same model described for corrupted cults earlier."

Mogan concluded that the man was actually receiving his power from Kol Korran, the Sovereign of Travel. But while it's possible to draw spells from worshiping a shoe, this would be extremely rare. Though the cause is debated, scholars recognize that the more similar your target of worship is to an archetypal Sovereign, the more likely you are to be granted divine magic.

Across the rest of the Barrens, history was marked by the rise and fall of countless mighty chibs. Chib is a Goblin term sometimes translated as \"chieftain,\" but it literally means \"boss\" or \"big person\"--and in the Barrens, the chib was often just the biggest creature around. Typically a band would form around an ogre, ettin, or troll--a creature powerful enough to assert their will over goblins, kobolds, or lesser creatures of their own kind.

												"To the people to the east of the Graywall Mountains, it seemed that the Daughters of Sora Kell appeared out of nowhere--and it felt much the same to the chibs of the Barrens. But evidence suggests that it was the culmination of years, or even decades, of planning. How long did it take to train the trolls and ogres now known as Maenya's Fist? How did the Daughters acquire the armor and weapons wielded by this force? Some say that Sora Maenya assembled her troops in a forgotten Dhakaani fortress deep below the Byeshk Mountains, and that she oversaw the forging of their weapons in this ancient foundry. Sora Maenya calls the soldiers of Maenya's Fist her children, and some scholars believe this might be literally true; both her war trolls and skullcrusher ogres are smarter and more capable than their common cousins. But how long would such an endeavor take? Melian Mit Davandi of the Library of Korranberg has advanced the theory that demiplanes may have been involved--that Maenya's lair in Khyber could exist outside of the normal flow of time, allowing the schemes of the Daughters to be both a recent development and the work of generations. Sora Teraza approached the Queen of Stone and the lords of the Venomous Demesne in 985 YK, and the Daughters brokered the services of fully half of the Znir Pact mercenaries in this time. No one knows just how long the Daughters spent in preparation--but 986 YK is when they made their presence known.",
												"Leading up to the attack on Stubborn, the Daughters spoke with--and dominated--the greatest powers of the Barrens. The chibs of the plains only understood force, and the Daughters displayed it; the scattered bands of raiders were forced to submit, and those who refused to bow to the Daughters of Sora Kell were executed in gruesome ways.",
												"In 987 YK the Daughters of Sora Kell summoned the region's most powerful leaders to the ruins now known as the Great Crag. There, Sora Katra presented the blueprint for the new nation, appointing warlords and specifying their responsibilities and regions. Work began on the greatest cities of this new nation: Graywall, the Great Crag, and the port city of Vralkek. The old fortress of Stubborn was repurposed and renamed Stonejaw. While some of the raider bands were left to follow their old ways, many were absorbed into the new nation. Thousands of goblins and kobolds were freed from their oppressive chibs and given opportunities in the new cities. This new order was maintained by gnoll peacekeepers of the Znir Pact. When that proved insufficient--when a chib refused to release their captive subjects or defied the Daughters--Maenya's Fist would descend to destroy them. The message was simple: Change was coming. You could find your place in Droaam, or you could choose obliteration.",
												"The Daughters' ambitious plans were strengthened by an alliance with House Tharashk. For Tharashk, this provided access to the rich mineral resources of Droaam and the services of monstrous mercenaries, which opened an entirely new path for the house. For the Daughters, it tied them to a force with a legitimate voice and influence in the East. Tharashk agents convinced the Twelve to open up trade to Droaam--at least to the new city of Graywall. The house helped to organize laborers and build the new cities. Through Tharashk, the denizens of Droaam began to appear throughout the Five Nations, though tensions continued in the vicinity of Orcbone. Gargoyles and harpy couriers found a niche in Sharn. Ogre laborers could be found in Fairhaven and Wroat. In Sharn, the Gargoyle replaced the Bat in the Race of Eight Winds. Today, many citizens of the Five Nations are still uncomfortable around these creatures, but their presence is slowly becoming less remarkable."

In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride--driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. \"Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still.

This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored.

A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder--the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds.

There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city--though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent. Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse--foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.",

												"Droaam不受加利法尔法典的约束，也没有统一的司法法典。因此，除非卡特拉之声推翻他们，否则正义完全掌握在当地长老手中。每个部落都有自己的卫兵部队。在一个小村庄里，这可能是一小撮加阿拉姆兽人，但在灰墙这样的大城市里，卫兵是一支多才多艺的重要力量：兽人、牛头人和食人魔，还有哈皮人和巨妖的支持。任何一个主要社区都有一支兹尼尔地精的驻军。这些雇佣兵在需要时充当维和人员，但他们直接为女儿会服务，而不是为奇布服务；在某种程度上，他们的存在是为了阻止奇布背叛女儿会。",
												"Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers--anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall--but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.",
												"在大多数社区中，对严重的犯罪行为，法官会立即执行死刑。对于较轻的罪行，受害者会被打上烙印，要么被严刑拷打，要么被打成残废，要么接受战斗审判；大多数大城市都有一个竞技场，可以达到这个目的（尽管人们也可以选择成为角斗士）。那些在惩罚中幸存下来的人被释放了。",
												"There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it--but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice--but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.",
												"灰墙有一个相当大的外国区，Calabas。灰墙的illithid军阀Xor'chylic授予Tharashk家族的Kundran Torrn起诉在Calabas犯下的罪行的权利；这意味着在该地区，Galifar法典的大部分内容具有影响力。这一制度可以适用于其他拥有相当多东部人口的社区。",
												"A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; {@i everyone} clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her--he needs to know better--but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters."

												"Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey--and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.",

												"Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth--so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage--\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"--adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam--or is perhaps even an ally--there won't be a bounty on its teeth.",
												"While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter--any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.",
												"Droaam's main exports--brokered through House Tharashk--are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!",
												"在描述Droaam的商品时，要考虑到整个地区可以找到的大量风格和质量，其中一些在{@table Droaamish Artisanship|ExploringEberron}表格中有所描述。荒原突袭者没有铁匠，用木头和石头的简单武器作战，或者用昂代尔或卡尔纳特提供的装备作战。然而，女儿们一直在努力改善这种状况，在许多更多的城市中可以找到地精和冥王的工匠工作。而毒液之神是一个神秘的先进社会；虽然他们缺乏坎尼斯家族的工业能力，但他们却能熟练地生产出超越五国的魔法珍品。德罗亚姆人使用的大多数魔法物品都来自于该王国。"

												"Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find {@i your} path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species--from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.",
												"所有这些都在《Droaam》中以许多微小的方式得到了回应。例如，狂欢是专门为 \"愤怒 \"举行的狂喜庆典，参与者被鼓励放弃一切克制，拥抱他们的情感。在战斗中，许多德罗阿姆人将杀戮献给守护者，希望通过为君主的囤积物增加灵魂来赢得青睐；同样，将意外之财的一部分献给守护者也是一种习惯，这样他就不会嫉妒了。",
												"尽管（或因为）有许多不同的信仰和做法，德罗阿姆人还是非常纵容他人的信仰。Znir地精鄙视恶魔，但不干涉牛头人或铁弗林的做法。哈比人不与梅杜莎人争论愤怒的本质；他们知道真正的答案，这就足够了。每个人一般都尊重影子，即使这对不同的人意味着不同的事情。这个原则一般也适用于东方人。德罗亚姆人认为崇拜主宰者是愚蠢的，但如果你召唤奥里昂，也不会感到不安，而且不在乎卡拉什塔或精灵的信仰。",
												"There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam--the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone."

Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish--for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.",

The form of grist served in a mill changes daily--stew, sausage, meat broth--but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew--there's plenty more where it came from!",

The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for.

														"Over countless generations of life in the Barrens, the orcs of the region developed two distinct cultures. The larger of the two are the {@i Gaa'aram}--Children of Wrath. The Gaa'aram embraced the chaotic, raiding lifestyle of the Barrens. Where the goblins and kobolds were often forced into service by more powerful creatures, the Gaa'aram voluntarily rallied around the most powerful leaders and served as fierce warriors. To an orc of the Gaa'aram, who you fight for is less important than the fact that you fight and fight well. As such, Gaa'aram orcs were often encountered as raiders; they're the reason for the name of the Orcbone fortress that guards the Gap of Graywall. Gaa'aram orcs can be found in all of the diverse cities, and they're usually passionate supporters both of Droaam and their local warlords.",

The Gaa'ran orcs are pacifists and farmers--one of the only cultures to farm in the open Barrens. They believe that violence stains the soul--that those whose souls are pure pass beyond Dolurrh, but that killing another forever destroys a piece of your soul. The Gaa'ran held firm to their beliefs even in the face of torture and death, and over time it became common for the Barrens chibs to allow Gaa'ran settlements to stand--with the understanding that the local raiders would regularly show up and take their produce. While this was a harsh life, the Gaa'ran have prospered under the Daughters of Sora Kell. Though grist is the primary source of sustenance in Droaam, the Daughters recognize the value of agriculture, and Gaa'ran tribes have been given resources and placed in charge of a number of agricultural projects.",

										"The destruction of Stubborn and the declaration of Droaam came as a terrible shock to the people of the Five Nations. This wasn't the work of an upstart prince or an ogre chieftain. Both Sora Katra and Sora Maenya were known from countless tales--mostly terrifying ones in which things don't end well for the heroes. To most people, the Daughters were legends, figures used to scare unruly children. The Daughters were the reason you were afraid of the darkness as a child; Sora Maenya could be lurking in the shadows, waiting to add your skull to her collection. Most people of the Five Nations know nothing of the daelkyr or of the Dreaming Dark, but they know the Daughters of Sora Kell. This is one reason the Five Nations have refused to acknowledge Droaam; at the end of the day, they can't believe that it is real, and they hope that maybe they'll wake up tomorrow and realize it was all just a bad dream.",
										"In principle, the Daughters of Sora Kell are hags. Sora Katra is a green hag, cunning and charismatic. Sora Maenya is an annis hag, possessed of tremendous strength and hunger. And Sora Teraza is a dusk hag, who sees the tapestry of the future laid out before her. However, calling Sora Katra a green hag is like calling a legendary bard a \"human.\" It's a foundation--a basic archetype to begin with. But all of the Daughters possess powers far beyond what's normal for hags of their type. Their mother was Sora Kell, one of thirteen immortal night hags said to have been created by Eberron and Khyber at the dawn of time. Each had a different father; in some stories these were fiends, in others, giants. Regardless, they possess inherited power, which has only increased over centuries of schemes and adventures. While the Daughters are usually spoken of together, each is a legend in her own right; they each have their own goals and distinct personality, and each one can offer different hooks for story or adventure.",

												"The stories of Sora Katra are many and varied, for she's a gifted shapeshifter who seems to love meddling in the lives of heroes. She's the old woman at the inn whose idle comment sows doubt in lovers' hearts. She's the tinker who gives the farmboy the magic sword that helps him become king--the same blade he uses to kill himself in the final act. It's only through a wink to the audience or a hint to the reader that Katra's true identity is revealed. In some ways, this fictive role overlaps with that of the Traveler, but the gifts of the Traveler bring chaos, while those of Sora Katra inevitably bring {@i tragedy.}",
												"However, Sora Katra isn't always the villain in tales. When she acts openly, she often poses a challenge that tests the hero's wits or resolve. In most of these tales, the champion fails the challenge--which is, to be fair, usually weighted against them--and disaster ensues. But in those rare cases where the protagonist remains true to their ideals or outwits the hag, she always holds true to her promises. It's this penchant for testing resolve and punishing failings that gave birth to the popular tale that if a child makes a promise and breaks their word, Sora Katra will come in the night and take a finger from them.",
												"Sora Katra is known as a schemer. In many stories she's found weaving curses on her loom--plotting misery and misfortunes to release into the world. In the tale {@i The Sleeping Prince}, she curses the Prince of Wroat three days after his birth. In the end of the story, the Woodcutter's Daughter kills the giant in the King's Forest and gives Katra his tongue, and when the curse is lifted, the Woodcutter's Daughter marries the prince. Scholars have long debated Katra's motives in the tale. Is it that she couldn't kill the giant, and was setting a scheme in motion that would lead to his downfall? Or was it actually her goal from the start to elevate the Woodcutter's Daughter--did she create the obstacle in order to give her chosen hero a chance to rise? While this is a positive spin, there's no question that Katra's actions always bring misfortune to {@i someone}--especially those who fail to measure up to her challenges.",
												"Sora Katra is a brilliant orator. In the stories, she usually uses her words to sow doubt or discord, but she is equally capable of binding people together and weaving dreams of glory. In Droaam, she is the voice of the Daughters, and her speeches have drawn a dozen different species together, and made raiders and brigands believe that they are part of something greater and grander than they ever imagined. In part, this is about playing on the peoples' anger and fear of the easterners. But she also has a knack for simply knowing what people want--such as the ambitions of her warlords--and using that to her advantage. Combined with the guidance of Teraza, she foresees problems and invariably finds someone to take the fall for things that cannot be avoided. In some ways, this is the central mystery of Droaam: Why found a nation to begin with? And why seek to be recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, when Teraza most likely knew the effort would fail? One possibility is that the entire nation is just a stepping-stone toward her true goal--just as the prince in {@i The Sleeping Prince} was a tool that ultimately elevated the Woodcutter's Daughter. It's possible Droaam is another of her tests--but who's being tested, and what happens if they fail? What about the criminal organization Daask? Is this just a diversion for Katra, or is Daask advancing a mysterious agenda?",
												"In her natural form, the Mistress of the Mires is a green hag, with green skin and dark green hair. However, she loves illusion and rarely remains in her true form. If she has no reason to remain in a particular form, she often shifts in mid-speech. She delights in forms with a personal impact on the people she's dealing with--taking the face of a dead lover or a betrayed friend. She possesses abilities like a powerful bard, both the ability to inspire and to perform powerful enchantments and illusions.",
												"Sora Katra loves challenging heroes, which makes it easy to tie her to a story. Perhaps Droaam itself has been created to test the player characters--she's spent a decade and built a nation to force the characters to make a difficult decision. If you want to create a connection between Katra and a character, is the character the archetypal Sleeping Prince--who Katra torments, seemingly without reason--or are they the Woodcutter's Daughter, who may be challenged but has a chance to come out ahead in the end? Consider also the tale of the farmer who became a king. Katra might give a character an artifact, seemingly for no reason; can they use it wisely, or will it lead them to despair? While a connection to Katra could develop during play, you could establish a tie to the Mistress of the Mires in a character's backstory. Perhaps Katra cursed the character's family because of something their parents did; is there something the character can do to lift the curse? Or perhaps the character unwittingly did a favor for a disguised Katra back when they were a child, and she promised to repay this act of kindness; when and how will the character call in this favor?"

The question is whether they knew her identity when she taught them; was she the Reaver of the Woods, or did she teach them in an assumed form? If a character is from the Eldeen Reaches, might they have met Sora Maenya as a child? Perhaps they ran away from home, and Maenya devoured their village while they were away. Or maybe they made an unwise bargain--asking Sora Maenya to kill a childhood rival, which she did; now the character owes her a debt, and someday she'll come to collect.

She's known to be blind, yet she's perfectly aware of her surroundings; it's not that she can see, she simply {@i knows} where everything is. In some tales, it's said that she knows when every individual will die; in other stories, she herself chooses when each person will die. It's also said that she has a library in which she keeps books documenting the lives of remarkable people--books that contain the souls of those heroes, and that she appears to collect the soul when that champion is near death.",
												"Sora Teraza is a dusk hag. While she can change her shape, she rarely does so; she wears an old, tattered robe and hides her face beneath a deep hood. She rarely speaks, other than to issue cryptic pronouncements. When she's not with her sisters, she spends her time tending her library in the Great Crag, or in meditation. Teraza is certainly the most gifted oracle of the age. This may be connected to the Draconic Prophecy, or it may be that she perceives the future in a different way. Certainly, Teraza is never depicted as having to seek her answers; it seems she just knows them. Given this unerring knowledge, it would seem like it should be impossible for the Daughters to ever fail; she can reveal the plans of their enemies and the location of any treasure they might seek. But Teraza doesn't always share her knowledge, act in the best interests of her sisters, or even her own interests. Why not? The simplest answer is that she is unhinged; any mind could be broken by the burden of such knowledge. A more complicated possibility is that she is trapped by her own knowledge--that she already knows what she is going to do, and doesn't actually have any real free will. Or perhaps her knowledge isn't as absolute as it appears: she has the potential to know anything, but some things simply evade her sight.",
												"Regardless, Sora Teraza certainly can, and sometimes does, warn her sisters about possible threats, such as treacherous warlords or approaching player characters, and directs them to the best path to ensure victory. But she can also remain silent, or only offer information later than others consider helpful. For example, she could reveal that there's an Aundairian war criminal--a wizard of tremendous skill, who Sora Katra would surely have a use for--hiding out in Graywall. But she might provide this information a year after his arrival, and only a day before he plans to depart--leaving Katra with just 24 hours to mobilize agents to try and capture the wizard. Will these agents compete with the player characters, or will they be the player characters? Teraza might also provide a character with a mysterious piece of information--via {@spell dream} or {@spell sending}--that could be very useful, even if it could hurt her sisters. This doesn't mean she is betraying her sisters; it is simply that she does what she must do, when she must do it. While Sora Teraza's knowledge is potentially limitless, in practice, it's a tool to drive an interesting story, not to derail it."

										"Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin--then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as {@i Znir}--a word that simply means \"stone\"--and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one--not chib, god, or demon--to hold dominion over them.",

There was no parallel to the united force of the Pact within the region, and they could have defeated the various chibs and warlords they served. But the gnolls have never had a desire to rule other creatures; they love the hunt and the thrill of battle. The path of the Pact allows them to do what comes naturally--to stalk and kill, to fight endless battles--but they do so together. They choose the paths they follow and the battles they fight. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.",

Znir simply refuse to allow the demon within to hold dominion over them. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence--to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return.",
												"In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as {@i hwyri}--Gnoll for \"warden\"--and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats. There has been some tension between the Vult and the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack; the Vult shamans suspect that the Pack is vulnerable to the influence of the Wild Heart.",

										"Little is known of the origins of the goblinoid species. Aereni records describe warring goblinoids on Khorvaire around forty thousand years ago, when the elves settled on Aerenal. But recent studies suggest that the goblinoids themselves appeared quite suddenly around this time. It's commonly believed that the goblinoids evolved in vast caverns below the surface, but some modern scholars hold competing theories. Kel Kador of the Library of Korranberg believes that the goblinoid subspecies were magebred from a common ancestor, and that this goblin progenitor might still be found underground. Hass Holan of Morgrave University has advanced a more exotic theory--that the goblinoids may have emerged from a demiplane within Khyber, from a warlike realm that has yet to be found. The goblins themselves have little interest in the origins of the {@i dar}--a Goblin word meaning \"the people.\" For them, the history of Dhakaan is the history of the dar. The two are considered synonymous, and regardless of their origins, the Dhakaani culture emerged approximately sixteen thousand years ago.",
										"The legend that opens this section deals with the roots of the Empire of Dhakaan, when six hobgoblin kings fought over ancient Khorvaire. Jhazaal Dhakaan was the greatest duur'kala bard of the age and the artifacts she crafted are testament to her remarkable power; the warhorn {@i Ghaal'duur} in chapter 7 is one of her creations. If the legend is to be believed, Jhazaal Dhakaan performed a feat of epic magic. She crafted the dream of an empire and bound the goblinoids of the time to this dream. This {@i Uul Dhakaan}--Dream of Dhakaan--gave the ancient goblins oneness of culture and purpose, uniting them under Jhazaal Dhakaan as the first {@i marhu}--emperor of Dhakaan. The Dhakaani empire spread across Khorvaire, pushing the dwarves back into the depths of Khyber and driving the dragonborn into the eastern jungles. The Dhakaani repelled Tairnadal colonists, and drove orcs, gnolls, and other minor cultures into the wild frontiers.",
										"The golden age of Dhakaan lasted over five millennia, with goblins ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by Galifar. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with the Xoriat incursion, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations into Khorvaire. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and transformed goblinoids into aberrations, such as dolgaunts and dolgrims. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions turned the tide. The orc Gatekeeper druids bound the daelkyr in Khyber, but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies and hunted down the beasts that survived. But as legend tells, the daelkyr achieved victory even in defeat. Dyrrn the Corruptor created a psychic contagion that severed goblinoids from the Uul Dhakaan, and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational beliefs. Leaders among the {@i duur'kala}--dirge singers looked to for wisdom and guidance--identified the threat but couldn't find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the {@i Kapaa'vola}--the Treacherous Whisper--had faded. These armies called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}, Keepers of the Empire--a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.",
										"On the surface, the remnants of the empire fragmented and collapsed. As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned, the history of the Empire of Dhakaan came to an end the moment Dyrrn the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa'vola. But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the Keepers left; the wider world doesn't even know the term Kapaa'vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn's curse caused paranoia and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost, and the traditions of the daashor--artificers of Dhakaan--and the duur'kala were forgotten. New religions and cults emerged. Some tribes embraced the Dark Six, while others revered a wider pantheon. Under Dhakaan, the goblinoid subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa'vola, the strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral. When human explorers found these warring tribes living in the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they destroyed. This false narrative was used to justify countless atrocities. Humanity slowly displaced the goblinoids, seizing the lands that once belonged to Dhakaan. Goblins were often subjugated, while bugbears and hobgoblins were driven into the wilds or the upper levels of Khyber. In time scholars learned the truth--that the foundations they'd built upon were goblin cities, not human. But few people cared; in their eyes, the goblinoids were merely savages, children of the Dark Six, dangerous and cruel. It was in this time that the terms {@i goblin, bugbear,} and {@i hobgoblin} took root, even among the former dar themselves.",

While they remained severed from the Uul Dhakaan and knew nothing of the hidden Keepers, the Ghaal'dar recovered scraps of their ancient history. The hobgoblins pursued {@i muut} and {@i atcha}--their duty to their people and their personal honor--though they knew these only as abstract concepts. They honed their anger against the {@i chaat'oor}\u2013the non-native defilers--who had stolen their ancient lands. Some of the Ghaal'dar tribes served as mercenaries during the Last War, learning more about the chaat'oor in the process.",

A DC 20 check provides very detailed information: the importance of muut and atcha, the names of specific rulers, perhaps even the knowledge of the Kapaa'vola and the belief that some clans fled from this threat.

Two of these clans, the Kech Volaar and the Kech Shaarat have both revealed themselves to the Darguuls; but they have concealed their age, their power, and their resources. The Ghaal'dar know the Kech Volaar as an isolated clan of scholars with talented duur'kala. They know the Kech Shaarat as proud and deadly warriors.

There is honor in using cunning to defeat a superior foe, so guerilla warfare, ambushing a foe, and even assassination are acceptable tactics, if this is what muut requires. Dar must be ready to die for the empire--but when possible, it's always better to kill for the empire.

If your DM approves of this concept, you might even be able to replace the 10th-level Spirit Walker feature with the Intimidating Presence of the Berserker barbarian, as it's difficult to explain how commune with nature is tied to your military training."

They cling to property, whether it's land or more portable possessions. They're fierce in protecting the things that they care about. But as the bard Kessler said, \"The Mror care deeply about their stories, but facts just get in the way.\" Mror talespinners have an endless supply of stories about the mighty deeds of clan heroes, but when it comes to specific dates or verifiable facts, things often get muddy. Records of debts, marriages, adoptions--these things are written down by Sivis scribes. But general history is largely trusted to the passed-down tales of the spinners, and they make history {@i interesting}.

Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that's enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization--or ruins of it--waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there's no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice. While origin stories vary from clan to clan, the talespinners all agree on the broad eras of Mror history that followed.",

Dhakaani records--which are more accurate than those of the dwarves--show that the Dhakaani encountered dwarves late in the golden age of the Dhakaani Empire and drove them east, eventually reaching a stalemate. The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts. The dar had no need of the territory, and in time, decided the effort of conquest wasn't worth the rewards. This was the origin of what the dwarves call {@i Sol Udar}, the Realm Below."

At some point--whether years or centuries later is unclear--a group of dwarven warriors were exiled from the Realm Below, and found a new home in the mountains above, along with their families and followers. The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn't decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables. The truth is buried beneath the weight of thousands of years and may never be known."

Even as humans spread across the land, the dwarves continued to devote their energy and resources to their own ongoing vendettas. While they were unquestionably fierce warriors and made fine weapons, their deep division prevented any progress. The Ironroot dwarves weren't the only dwarves on Khorvaire; some had spread east into what's now the Lhazaar Principalities.

Early explorers found finely crafted treasures, along with evidence of even deeper mines and fortresses.

But soon they learned what had become of the ancient dwarves of the Realm Below, and why the kingdom had never reached up to the exiles. The ancient dwarves had been wiped out thousands of years ago by the daelkyr, for Sol Udar abutted on the demiplane prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor, one of the mightiest of the daelkyr. The first explorers found curious tools formed from flesh and bone--and then they discovered the creatures that made them. Dolgrim hordes rose from the depths. Entire colonies were lost and consumed by illithid corruption. While the Five Nations fought the Last War, the Mror fell into {@i Dol Udar}, the War Below, discussed in more detail later in \"The Realm Below\" section.",

Though the dwarves are few in number, their economic power and strong fortifications have deterred any Karrnathi retribution, and no one challenged their recognition under the Treaty of Thronehold. The dwarves are proud and prosperous--and yet, old feuds linger. The Realm Below remains both a glorious lure and a deadly threat.

Anyone who spends much time around Mror quickly grows used to the phrase {@i Tol kollan}--or the Common translation, \"That reminds me of a story.\" Mror hate quick meetings; any gathering should have time for tales.

Though their basic outfits may be few, Mror place great stock in accessories, and a Mror outfit typically has elements that can be reversed, shifted, or removed. Brooches have important cultural significance, and can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, the symbol of a Sovereign whose favor is sought, or even moods; some brooches mean \"leave me alone\" or \"looking for company.\" Other forms of jewelry--rings, chains, bracelets--are commonly worn by dwarves of both genders; this is an opportunity to show wealth, but decorative ornaments of iron are also worn by common folk. The {@i dultar}--blood blade--is a dagger worn both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance; each of the ruling clans has a distinct style of dultar.

In time, explorers would realize that some of the richest mines were not entirely natural--that some shafts connect to demiplanes where the rules of reality don't always apply, like mines where emeralds grow like moss.

Beyond the innate desire for these things, for the Mror, it's a matter of pride. Sol Udar is the work of their ancestors. The knowledge that it holds, the untold wealth, this is their birthright.

												"多尔衮经常指挥多尔衮的部队，但也可以发现多尔衮单独行动或维护奇怪的神龛。以{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}表示的统计数据代表了典型的生物，但独特的多尔人可以有更大的能力。多尔人能够以惊人的纪律性和精确性行动，但他们的策略往往是非正统的和神秘的。",
												"德鲁并不是异类，而是被认为是被迪尔恩的力量扭曲的矮人。可能有一些德鲁人的根源可以追溯到建造索尔乌达的古代矮人；然而，普遍的假设是德鲁人是诺德隆霍德失落的矮人的后代。其他的德鲁人可能是最近的受害者，是由在多尔乌达尔俘虏的摩尔定居者创造的。德鲁人是游牧的清道夫，他们保持着持续的运动，在地下世界的深层隧道里游荡。他们完全无视Dyrrn的反常行为，而且似乎反过来也被无视；一名侦察员报告说看到一支德鲁人队伍穿过多尔格瑞姆营地，双方都没有承认。一些学者认为，德鲁人无法感知反常现象，一些人认为自己处在一个现实中，在这个现实中，索尔乌达仍然处于辉煌时期，而德鲁人是其领主。他们似乎并不直接为Dyrrn服务，但他们肯定将所有来自上面的外来者视为敌人。一个自称Moror勋爵的derro军阀曾多次攻击Moror殖民地；然而，目前还不清楚这是否是一个在整个王国都有追随者的强大derro，还是有几个derro savants使用这个称号。",
												"戴尔克尔通常掌握着乌达遗址中最重要的区域；因此，这些地牢中既有矮人创造的宝物，也有戴尔克尔的有机工具。然而，迪尔恩势力所声称的区域的目的差别很大。在某些情况下，这些生物所做的事情有一个清晰的逻辑：多尔恩可能占领了一个古老的铸造厂并开始锻造武器。探索者可以找到某种产卵坑，在那里生产新的畸变体。但畸变体的行为往往是陌生的、无法解释的；一个密室可能包含一个巨大的、跳动的心脏，但没有明显的作用，或者是一池反映另一地点的液体。深处的居民是不可预测的，畸形体可能没有与自然界人类相同的生物需求；例如，Dolgrims不需要在地下农场工作以获得食物。",
												"有些反常者在一个地区永久定居，但其他反常者可能从通往迪尔恩领域的门户溢出，还有一些反常者可能由遍布受侵扰地区的有机物就地生长，或者由愚蠢的探险者的尸体创造。一个胡言乱语的人可能与上周冒险进入深处的矮人的声音窃窃私语。",
												"While mind flayers can be found serving any daelkyr, Dyrrn the Corruptor is their creator. Sol Udar is thus a logical place to encounter mind flayers or any creatures associated with them: intellect devourers, ulitharids, neothelids, and the like. Bear in mind that these creatures may serve a very different role in Eberron than in other settings, as they are the creations of Dyrrn; a neothelid may be an intentional creation, as opposed to an accidental abomination. Elder brains are tools used as telepathic anchors, linking local mind flayers, while the elder brains are linked to Dyrrn itself. In general, mind flayers serve as Dyrrn's emissaries and lieutenants--directing lesser aberrations or humanoid cults, or engaged in inscrutable research. The most infamous mind flayer is Dyrrashar, the ulitharid who delivered Dyrrn's Promise. It has appeared multiple times since then, often leading subtle attacks against Udar colonies.",
												"大多数其他威胁都是在孤立的情况下遇到的，在黑暗中几乎可以找到任何种类的畸变；你也可以使用畸变或怪兽的不寻常的变体，将生物转变为适合你的故事。例如，目击者主要服务于眼睛之主Belashyrra，但Dyrrn可以让目击者的仆人长着嘴，周围有触手，而不是牙齿的大嘴。"

												"--Lord Halarak of Soldorakhold"

										},
										"The first Mror dwarves to explore Sol Udar were amazed at the treasures they found. While there was no sign of the original inhabitants, their possessions remained. Early explorers found remarkable jewelry, intriguing artwork, and caskets of coins--but magic items were often the most valuable. Many of these are like those found in the Five Nations, with a focus on practicality--items such as the {@item alchemy jug}, {@item bag of holding}, or {@item decanter of endless water}. While similar items are produced in the Five Nations, the arcane techniques used are intriguing, and some items displayed superior qualities; one team of scouts found an alchemy keg that's bulkier than the standard jug, but can produce twice the amount of liquid each day--and the alcohol it produces is far more potent than that of a standard {@item alchemy jug}. The {@table Sol Udar Trinkets|ExploringEberron} table presents some interesting items, both magical and mundane, that might be found adventuring in the Realm Below.",
										"Beyond the minor curiosities scattered throughout Sol Udar, there were far greater treasures--legendary magic items and artifacts, things that can't be created in the present day. Only a few of these wonders have been found, and these have become a source of immense pride for the clans that possess them. It's common for a clan to declare such items to be the work of their ancestors, though this is typically a talespinner's fancy. Little concrete scholarship has been done on most of these treasures, and despite the commonly accepted myth of the dwarven exile, there's no reason to think that the ancestors of the modern Mror were all distributed evenly around the mountains, their descendants just happening to have remained exactly above their ancestral homes. Nonetheless, these relics are seen as proof of the power and potential of a clan, and most clan leaders don't look kindly on outsiders questioning their stories. Surely even more powerful and precious artifacts remain to be found in the deeper layers of the Realm Below, but the Dol Udar has kept the Mror from claiming these wonders.",
										"While battling aberrations and making expeditions into infested layers, the dwarves recovered another unusual treasure--symbionts, living tools crafted by the daelkyr. Chapter 7 presents eight new symbionts that might be found in the Realm Below. Many clans want nothing to do with these foul things; Doldarun dwarves always burn symbionts with the corpses of the creatures that carry them. But not all dwarves share this distaste. Some clans see symbionts as just another form of treasure from the depths. The Toldorath and Droranath dwarves have no fear of symbionts, and a warrior may carry a {@i hungry axe} (as described in chapter 7) without protest from their clan; but these clans haven't embraced symbionts beyond keeping the trophies taken from fallen enemies. Both Soldorak and Narathun have gone further; in addition to using salvaged symbionts, these clans have spent decades studying the science behind these items and creating their own symbionts. In some cases, they are replicating existing items, but Soldorak fleshcrafters have also created unique symbionts, integrating the principles of daelkyr magic with their own arcane traditions. Those clans that favor such tools call fleshcrafted items {@i dolaur}--spoils of war. On the other hand, those that despise them often call symbionts and those who use them {@i dularash}--foul blood--a term often used to refer to spoiled meat or corrupted bloodlines.",
										"Many existing magic items can be reflavored as symbionts. A Soldorak artificer might create a {@item cloak of elvenkind}, but formed of leathery, living flesh that shifts in hue like a chameleon. A Narathun {@item rope of climbing} isn't rope at all, but a coiled tentacle that follows the commands of the creature holding it. The Soldorak have created {@i lighting bugs}--identical in function to {@item everbright lantern|erlw|everbright lanterns}, but able to cling or detach to a surface on command. These bugs need to be fed a few drops of blood each day, and in communities that use these, the former lamplighters now walk the streets to feed the bugs from their own body.",
										"外人可能会对这些活生生的工具感到恐惧，但对许多人来说，使用这些工具的矮人的动机是合理的。对许多Moror来说，这些物品是战利品，是Moror战胜daelkyr的具体证明。\"如果你从一个倒下的敌人身上拿了一把魔斧，把它扔掉就太傻了。如果它在杀人时发出呻吟，那又如何？这是一个强大的武器，它是我征服的权利！\" 许多Moror还把携带这些工具看作是他们勇气的象征，自豪地表明他们不害怕穿上活的盔甲。他们可能会沉浸在他们的宝物给敌人带来的恐惧之中。此外，索多拉克和纳拉逊都是雄心勃勃的部族，他们的领导人希望通过解开肉体制造的秘密，可以提高他们部族的力量。",
										"那些蔑视共生体的部族说，肉体制作是一种可憎的行为，是对奥里昂和奥纳塔的侮辱。纳拉逊人反驳说，奥纳塔是工匠大师，可以使用任何材料；正是那些怀疑者认为奥纳塔的仆人无法掌握这种新媒介，从而侮辱了奥纳塔。这一论点在索拉纳特氏族中找到了支持者；虽然索拉纳特矮人并不像索多拉克和纳拉逊那样完全接受共生体，但他们对肉体制作的科学感兴趣，并一直在研究这些技术。",
										"The clans that embrace these techniques say that there is no danger, that this is just another form of science, while Doldarun dwarves insist that there can be no traffic with the daelkyr without corruption. The DM will have to decide the truth--can Soldorak benefit from their exploration of fleshcrafting, or are their warlocks and artificers being corrupted by Dyrrn? Whatever the truth of it, tensions between those clans who embrace these tools and those who revile them continue to rise.",
										"A character exploring the fleshcrafting techniques could be an artificer, describing their spellcasting as being tied to organic tools. Other arcane scholars who explore the techniques of the daelkyr become warlocks, typically using the Great Old One as their patron. In creating a Mror warlock, consider whether you're bargaining with Dyrrn itself--are you a cultist of the Dragon Below, willing to serve the daelkyr to gain power? Or have you gained your powers from studying the daelkyr and their methods, but instead of serving them, you're essentially stealing their techniques and hacking their systems? If you follow the latter path, you might not have a literal patron at all, or your \"patron\" could be a cabal of other dwarves studying the same techniques, and their requests help all of you learn more about fleshcrafting. Or if your DM is willing, perhaps you can even tap into the telepathic network of Dyrrn and the elder brains to steal their secrets; rather than receiving requests from your \"patron,\" you gain flashes of insight or information about them--attacks that are going to happen, plans you might stop--that could drive your actions."

It's worth noting that almost all Mror value many of these virtues, but in their stories, one founder is acknowledged as the best at that thing.

Some Droranath develop the skills of the stealthy hunter, striking down enemies from afar, but most Droranath warriors prefer to look their enemy in the eye and to see their fear. Droranath warriors perfect a technique called {@i tra dolhass}--the battle cry--a wild howl as the warrior charges the enemy, summoning their adrenaline and fury. The Droranath love battle, and for centuries they have sold their services as mercenaries through House Deneith. The \"Mror Howlers\" are valued as shock troops and vanguard warriors.

Farmers and brewers, they're all but indistinguishable to outsiders, but the two are constantly striving to outdo each other. This mythic pattern remains true today. These holds lie on opposite sides of Mirror Lake, and they're both devoted to farming and fishing; many of the mountain clans rely on these valley clans for sustenance. But despite their deep similarities in outlook and lifestyle, these two clans are constantly feuding. This rarely escalates to violence, instead typically driving them to find ways to perform better than their rivals, though there have been times where one clan has actively sabotaged the other. Despite this, both Lanarak and Londurak proclaim to possess vast common sense--to prefer fishing to fighting, and to always be able to find a simple solution to complex problems. Dwarves from these clans established inns across the holds; these days, most of these inns have been bought up or licensed by House Ghallanda, but there's a decent chance that if a bartender's a dwarf, they're from one of these two clans.",

Londurak quickly pulled out of the war; they have sealed all passages and forbidden anyone from venturing into Sol Udar. Lanarak still tends its gardens on the upper levels. This has given Lanarak an edge over its rivals, especially as traditional Mror spirits are made with mushrooms. However, Lanarak has also suffered several significant supernatural attacks over the last few decades--outbreaks of the Frenzy and similar threats. It's rare for dwarves from these valley clans to take risks or to leave the holds, but a remarkable folk hero or sailor could hear the call of adventure."

												"In Dwarven, {@i sol dorak} means \"defender of the realm.\" While most Mror legends present the legendary Lord Mror as a wise and powerful leader, the talespinners of Solangap say that Lord Mror was an iron-handed tyrant--that the hero Soldorak challenged Mror for the good of the common people, and it was this that led to the Exile. In all of the stories, Soldorak supports underdogs and challenges outdated systems and oppressive authority. In some ways, this is at odds with the fact that Soldorak remains part of the feudal system that has defined the holds for a thousand years. However, Soldorak is more flexible than the other clans. Tenant families have a path to become freeholders, and much like the Aereni, Soldorak seeks to draw the most talented dwarves from all walks of life into the ruling clan. However, this is a knife that cuts both ways; people can also be expelled from the ruling clan, and heirs are expected to constantly prove their worth and cunning, not to simply rest on the power of their name.",
												"这一原则是索多拉克性格的基石。\"权力必须赢得。目的是为了证明手段的正确性\"。他们认为常见的 \"荣誉 \"概念是为掌权者服务的把戏；真正的荣誉在于用你的智慧去战胜不可能战胜的困难。正是这一原则导致氏族贵族们创立了奥鲁姆，最初是作为反叛加里法尔行为的纽带；今天，它继续制衡着外国贵族和龙纹屋的影响。",
												"Soldorak is one of the most populous holds, and one of the richest. Its fortune lies in all manner of precious metals, especially platinum and gold; coins from the Soldorak Mint circulate across Khorvaire, and Soldorak has many foreign investments. It has invested deeply in the Realm Below and is second only to Clan Mroranon in its subterranean holdings. However, Soldorak has embraced the use of {@i dolaur}--symbionts--and continues to explore the alien powers of the daelkyr even while it recovers dwarf artifacts. Soldorak has also embraced the path of the warlock. These dwarves have less patience for arcane study than their allies in Narathun, and are less likely to become artificers or wizards. But bargaining for power, earning supernatural gifts with your wits and will? That's the Soldorak way. Soldorak maintains that this tradition is entirely safe--that Sol warlocks can tap the power of the daelkyr without serving them--but Doldarun is certain that all Soldorak dwarves are corrupt, and Mroranon sees this foul practice as another way to discredit its rivals.",
												"虽然这里是贵族和士兵的家，但索多克霍德也有不少骗子和罪犯。这里是各种流氓和术士的天堂，尤其是操纵达尔凯尔之力的伟大的老一辈术士。虽然外人认为索多拉克人是邪恶的，但他们主要是挑战传统，拒绝接受不劳而获的权威；索多拉克人的民间英雄可以在霍尔韦尔的任何地方为弱势者辩护。索多拉克矮人通常对有组织的宗教持怀疑态度；该地区的寺庙相对较少，神职人员和圣徒也不常见。"

They're stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another.

This could be pure fantasy--the modern Jhorash'tar aren't particularly adept healers--but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash'tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.",

While this caused initial tension, it also brought an influx of gold and influence, and served as a bridge between the holds and the outside world.

Noldrun was clever and curious, an explorer who was always finding new things. Noldrunhold was never a large clan, but its greatest mine--Korran's Maw--was a rich source for a seemingly impossible array of minerals, including Eberron and Khyber dragonshards. This made it a strong ally of House Kundarak and Zilargo, and brought tremendous wealth to the clan.",
												"然后，大约四百年前，Noldrunhold沉寂了。派往该地的信使从未回来。诺德隆之前与乔拉什塔尔人进行了许多激烈的战斗，责任立即落在了兽人身上；但没有人能够解释乔拉什塔尔人如何能够实现这样的屠杀。",

In some accounts, corpses were skinned; in others, there were no corpses, as if the Noldrun had all simply vanished. Some suggest that the Noldrun all gathered together and descended into Korran's Maw; others say the Jhorash'tar killed them and threw the bodies into the Maw. Neighboring clans Soldorak and Droranath both sought to expand into the abandoned territory and claim the empty spires, but all attempts were abandoned--again, the stories of why are unreliable. Some say the new settlers killed each other in an irrational frenzy, others say they simply disappeared. The Droranath blame the Jhorash'tar orcs, and mysteriously, there are tribes of Jhorash'tar still living on old Noldrun lands, though even they shun the empty cities and Korran's Maw.",
												"Today, many assume that the Noldrun must have been the first victims of the War Below--that they dug too deep and were destroyed by Dyrrn. Some assume the derro found in Sol Udar are the remnants of the Noldrun dwarves. But that's all just conjecture. Perhaps it was the work of a fiendish overlord imprisoned in the region. Perhaps it was an early impact of whatever caused the Mourning, or some sort of Cannith experiment. Or perhaps it was the Jhorash'tar after all, and the orcs possess some hidden power they have yet to reveal."

However, there are also tribes hungry for vengeance, driven by the cries of their fallen. Such tribes continue to engage in guerilla war and to spread terror however they can. As far as the Mror know, the orcs have had no contact with the Realm Below or the forces of Dyrrn--but it's possible that a tribe has been touched by the Corruptor, and could emerge with unusual powers or even allied with aberrations.",

												"The greatest wonders of the Thunder Sea lie deep below the surface, all but unknown to the people of Khorvaire. The kar'lassa are enormous beasts--miles in length--half-buried and sleeping in the floor of the Thunder Sea. Not even the dragons of Argonnessen know the origin of the kar'lassa. They've slept since the beginning of recorded history, and are immune to all forms of divination magic. They could be creations of Khyber trapped before they could rise to the surface, or they could've been crafted by Eberron to guard against some future threat. Perhaps they are young progenitors, and when they finally wake, they will create new worlds.",
												"All that's known for certain is that the kar'lassa are massive, immortal monstrosities... and that each is bound to one of the planes. Each kar'lassa radiates the effects of a powerful manifest zone, extending up to 13 miles. The appearance of each kar'lassa reflects the plane they're tied to; the kar'lassa of Shavarath is a massive draconic beast with steel scales, while the kar'lassa of Fernia is a serpent of embers, water forever boiling against its skin. But the strangest aspect of the kar'lassa is their dreams. As described in chapter 5, when mortals dream, their spirits are usually drawn into Dal Quor. However, when the kar'lassa dream, {@i they don't dream in Dal Quor}. Instead, each kar'lassa dreams in the plane it's tied to--and more wondrous yet, each great dreamer draws in the spirits of dreaming mortals. Any creature that dreams within 13 miles of a kar'lassa--including unwary sailors passing above, if any are bold enough to go off the approved travel routes--is pulled into the behemoth's dream, instead of dreaming in Dal Quor. So, for example, anyone who sleeps in the Dominion city of Hal'iri dreams their dreams in Irian. While dreaming in this way, a creature is only present as a spirit, and is immune to the negative environmental effects of that plane; so a mortal dreamer isn't hurt by the extreme heat of Fernia or the cold of Risia. Even if a dreamer dies in their dream from other causes, they just wake up. This is still {@i dreaming}; unless the dreamer is capable of lucid dreaming, they have little control of their actions and will likely only remember fragments of the experience. But if they do have tools or training that allow lucid dreaming (as with the {@i uul'kur} in chapter 7), this can be an interesting way to explore the planes.",

So what happens if a golin'dar dreams near a kar'lassa? These ancient primordial forces trump the work of Jhazaal Dhakaan, and the dar are pulled into the dream of the kar'lassa instead of to Dal Quor. However, all of the dream-tools crafted by the Kech Dhakaan--the {@i kra'uul} and {@i uul'kur}--function normally within the dream of a kar'lassa.",

														"The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are aware of how the kar'lassa influence the dreams of \"lesser\" races. Though the Protectorate hasn't yet captured any Dominion cities, they take great pride in their belief that because they don't sleep, they would be above the influence of the kar'lassa--but this belief is wrong! It's true that elves trance rather than sleep, entering a deep meditative state much like a lucid dream, self-directed and untouched by the influence of either Dal Quor or a kalashtar's quori spirit. However, this process is physiologically similar to a human's dreams and can likewise be hijacked by the kar'lassa--which would be a startling experience for an elf who's never dreamed before!"

												"The kar'lassa are a source of wonder, not monsters to be fought. To all tests, they appear to be immortal, and regenerate damage quickly. Spells such as {@spell flesh to stone} or {@spell disintegrate} only work on a tiny sliver of the kar'lassa, and even that's quickly restored. If one of these ancient slumbering monstrosities were to rise, it would be an almost unstoppable force of destruction, and destroy the Dominion city in the process. If one of these vast creatures emerged onto land, it could easily devastate cities without even meaning to.",
												"Titanic, unstoppable monstrosities that could threaten entire cities? That sounds a little like the tarrasque. And indeed, a simple way to introduce the tarrasque into Eberron is to present it as a kar'lassa rising from its slumber and threatening Sharn or Stormreach; just add the effects of a manifest zone to the region around it. The tarrasque is small for a kar'lassa; most are miles long, large enough that the sahuagin build cities around them. But it's possible a small kar'lassa might be the first to wake--can the heroes who oppose it find a way to return it to its slumber before the others wake? If a DM chooses to explore this plotline, they'll have to decide the truth about the origins of the kar'lassa. If they're the children of Eberron, they might not want to destroy innocent creatures; they could have an important purpose as yet unfulfilled. On the other hand, if they're tools of the overlords or the Devourer, their rising will spell disaster."

												"Sahuagin culture is deeply aggressive; in any situation, they look to see how they can win. This combines with a deep sense of cultural unity; what matters isn't that I defeat the foe, it's that {@i we} defeat it. So while sahuagin frequently compete with other sahuagin, seeking to advance in rank and earn evolution into a higher form, this is about strengthening the Dominion, not simply personal pride. Sahuagin don't seek to cheat their way into positions they believe they don't deserve. Similarly, weakness can't be tolerated, and they spare no time on sentimentality. The sahuagin are children of the Devourer: the point of storm and sickness is to cleanse weakness and strengthen those who survive. Anyone who grows too old or infirm should be challenged by those below them--but this is rare in practice, for a sahuagin who realizes they can no longer perform their role will usually abdicate before they're challenged. It's common practice for a respected retiring leader to be consumed by their subordinates, so their spirit and skills will remain part of the Dominion. The sahuagin warrior who has grown too old to serve has no regrets about being consumed; they lived well, and now they give what strength they have left to nourish those who will come after them. A single life is fleeting; the Dominion is eternal, and your spirit lives on in your comrades who consume you.

They're always looking for something to do, a challenge to overcome. However, this leaves them little time for abstract reflection, romance, or whimsy; life is war, and there's no time for poetry. Some would also say this limits innovation, and the Dominion is indeed slow to change its methods. Sahuagin are austere in their needs and desires, and don't seek comfort, luxury, or personal wealth. This isn't to say the sahuagin don't enjoy life or seek entertainment--but rather, what drives the sahuagin is victory. They don't care for music or theater, but they enjoy gladiatorial combat and other forms of aggressive sport, such as public debates and arcane duels. They also love to eat, as this is a symbolic victory over whatever they're eating. Symbols of all kinds are important in sahuagin culture.

Most sahuagin aren't lucid dreamers, and don't remember their dreams with any more accuracy than most humans do.

At the heart of each temple lies the Or'lassa, the First Dreamer--a sahuagin priest sustained by direct infusions of kar'lassa blood. These infusions cause physical mutations that often reflect the shape of the kar'lassa and the plane it is tied to, as well as keep the First Dreamer in a comatose state. Their spirit permanently resides in the kar'lassa dream, where they anchor a temple formed from their pure will. Dream priests are trained in lucid dreaming, and they use these temples as a base both for planar research and to maintain communication across the Dominion. While they reside in different planes, the temples are mystically linked through the kar'lassa, and rituals allow the priests to spiritually travel between the dream-temples, carrying messages to the other cities. And it's in the dream of Hal'iri that the spirits of the Or'lassa meet to coordinate the actions of the Dominion; this is the {@i Sha'lassa}, the Council of Dreams."

It's generally more sophisticated than the Five Nations, but less advanced than Aerenal. Though the Dominion possesses capabilities beyond the Five Nations, its approaches can vary dramatically; for example, while the Dominion could generate {@spell continual flame}, light is largely provided by engineered bioluminescent coral. While the sahuagin employ all schools of magic--generally influenced by the resources of that city's kar'lassa--the Dominion's greatest advances are in alchemy, transmutation, and magebreeding.",
												"The Dominion has an exceptional talent for producing potions, allowing Dominion forces to temporarily boost their capabilities. But their technologies go far beyond temporary alterations, as the Dominion specializes in magebreeding all manner of creatures. The sahuagin themselves are carefully engineered to excel at the tasks chosen for them. In particular, the Dominion creates magewrights and sorcerers. This process isn't quick, taking place over the course of a sahuagin childhood, and including training as well as ongoing rituals and an unusual diet. The blood of the kar'lassa is used as a transformative catalyst, combined with the sahuagin principle, \"If you consume a thing you gain its power.\" As a result, creating a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer requires a young sahuagin to consume the flesh of a dragon--so there's a concrete limit on how many of these sorcerers the sahuagin can create.",
												"除了这些指导年轻萨瓦金人进化的基本技术外，多米尼克还可以诱发戏剧性的二次变异；许多萨瓦金人被这种获得更高形态的前景所激励。马伦蒂和四臂男爵是其中最著名的，但他们只是多米尼克的魔法繁殖能力的一小部分，DM可以创造更多的变异体来适应故事。例如，\"沙氩之爪\"（在第8章中介绍）拥有一种次级变异，被授予强大的牧师。这些形式的提升需要稀有的资源和大量的卡尔拉萨血（根据所寻求的变异类型从特定的梦者身上提取），并且只授予那些证明自己有资格的萨瓦金人。",
												"In addition to altering themselves, the sahuagin put many enhanced beasts to good use. Enhanced mantas are a common mount, possessing a swim speed of 90 feet. Mutated giant sharks and eels are used as larger vehicles, sometimes with seating areas formed upon their backs, other times with bony handles protruding from the beast's hide, allowing multiple riders to cling to the side. In place of warships, the Dominion fields dragon turtles with siege staffs embedded into their shells. The sahuagin have also created entirely new forms of life. The alchemists of Hal'kyth used the blood and biomatter of the kar'lassa to create plasmids: protean creatures similar to mimics, but capable of replicating the texture of inanimate objects as well as shape. Plasmids can be guards--often serving as living doors to secure chambers--but they're also a useful tool of industry, as a trained plasmid can itself become the tools a sahuagin artisan needs to perform its work.",
												"熟练的Dominion魔法师可以将{@spell fabricate}作为一种仪式，通过魔法将原材料塑造成他们想要的形状。多米尼克还使用一种叫做{@i korlass}（\"梦石\"）的物质，由梦者的生物质形成，作为一种工业材料；它可以像粘土一样被雕刻，然后通过魔法师的仪式固定在其形状。{@i Korlass}具有钢铁的强度，质地类似于贝壳，尽管它的外观因从哪个卡拉萨提取而不同。",
												"在考虑Dominion sahuagin的能力时，风暴牧师很可能是暴风雨牧师或征服圣骑士，而梦想牧师是知识牧师。萨哈金人的工匠通常是炼金术士，而最常见的奥术施法者形式是巫师（风暴巫术或龙族血统）和魔法师。萨哈金战士通常是战斗大师或冠军，但也有一些拥抱野蛮人的血腥狂热。吟游诗人、德鲁伊、巫师和术士不受多米尼克传统的支持，很少遇到。"

												"However, there are two significant challenges to adventuring as a sahuagin. The first is that you're an alien, a creature with a face few recognize, and that those who do typically view with fear. The second is the Limited Amphibiousness trait possessed by both sahuagin and locathah--a need for regular immersion in water can be a crippling requirement when an adventure leads to the Blade Desert. However, the sahuagin have developed a solution that solves both of these problems. While most people of the Five Nations have never {@i seen} a sahuagin, that doesn't mean they've never {@i met} one. Scholars who study the sahuagin know of malenti, sahuagin that are born indistinguishable from sea elves; the common belief is that this is a random mutation that occurs when sahuagin and sea elves live in close proximity. The sahuagin are happy to support this myth, because the truth is far more disturbing: Malenti aren't born, they're {@i made}. One of the sacred rituals of Sha'argon allows a sahuagin priest to guide a subject through ritually consuming a humanoid--and in consuming the creature, the sahuagin {@i becomes} that creature, taking both their form and their powers. People know about sea elf malenti, as they've been caught and exposed in the Dominion's long war with the Protectorate. But unbeknownst to the Five Nations, there are human malenti in Sharn, dwarf malenti in Stormreach, malenti passing as many races and traveling the surface wherever the Dominion needs eyes and hands.",
												"Chapter 6 provides a malenti background that could be coupled with any race, along with additional story hooks for malenti adventurers. Using this background, you can secretly play a sahuagin who's assumed the identity of the person they appear to be. While the Dominion has carried out a few targeted replacements to get malenti into influential positions, often malenti are just replacing people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: smugglers, fisherfolk, or pirates who strayed into Dominion territory. The purpose of this replacement isn't to take advantage of the character's previous life, but rather to place agents who can breathe on land and move freely without drawing attention. So as a malenti you might have been a sailor or a pirate--but now you're an adventurer traveling the world!"

										"Children of the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, the merfolk have been drawn into Eberron time and again during grand convergences between the planes. Merfolk can be found across the seas of Eberron, and every kara--tribe--has its own traditions and customs. The primary merfolk culture in the Thunder Sea is Karakala, whose members call themselves the Kalamer.",
										"The Thunder Sea has many strong manifest zones to Lamannia, the source of the endless storms that give the region its name. Nearly two centuries ago, an unusually strong convergence amplified the effects of the manifest zones. Both the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion were lashed by the power of Lamannia, and there were fears that the barrier between worlds could be permanently damaged. At the height of this disaster, Kalamer merfolk were pulled through from Lamannia; finding themselves without a means to return home, they used their rites and rituals to contain and repair the damage. These wild zones in the upper waters have always been a threat, and once it became clear that Karakala could mitigate the danger, both the sahuagin and sea elves agreed to give them freedom to travel in the upper waters, so long as they managed the manifest zones. Today, many Kalamer consider the Thunder Sea their new home, and travel from zone to zone, practicing their primal traditions. In a sense, they're nomadic gardeners, preserving the wild. As they're recognized as neutral by both the Dominion and the Protectorate, they often serve as messengers, couriers, and mediators, carrying news and negotiating on behalf of these powers--an important role, as the sahuagin refuse to speak directly to the sea elves. The reach of Karakala extends along the southern coast of Khorvaire, and the arrival of a Kalamer bard is often a celebrated event in small Brelish or Zil fishing villages; more than once, they've managed to settle disputes between fisherfolk and the Dominion.",
										"Overall, Karakala is a neutral force, concerned above all with traveling between the manifest zones--which they call the roots--and performing the rituals that keep them stable. However, there are Kalamer pods who quietly despise those who bend nature for their own benefit--dryskin, sahuagin, and sea elf alike--and especially oppose the use of elemental binding; these have come to see House Lyrandar as their foes. There are Kalamer who dream of someday cleansing the oceans of all traces of industry, of unleashing the full power of the manifest zones instead of keeping them contained. To date, Karakala has maintained its peaceful course, but it's always possible that their darker impulses will rise to the fore--that they'll show House Lyrandar and the nations of the world the true power of the storm.",

										"Long ago, the waters along the western coast of Aerenal were inhabited by peaceful locathah. The sahuagin of Sha'argon's Kingdom--a predecessor to the Eternal Dominion--steadily advanced toward Aerenal, conquering and assimilating the locathah. Concerned by the obvious aggression of the sahuagin, the Sibling Kings acted to secure the waters around Aerenal, establishing a buffer zone that would ensure that Sha'argon's Kingdom posed no direct threat. The line of Valraea was chosen, and through the power of the Undying Court, its nobles were physically transformed into {@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}, gaining iridescent skin and the ability to breathe beneath the water.",
										"Initially, the line of Valraea served as protectors and advisors, organizing the locathah and helping them construct superior defenses. Then the attacks began. The conflict slowly escalated; the harder the locathah fought, the more it drove sahuagin determination to claim the region. Valraean priests brought the full power of the Undying Court to bear against the attackers, and Sha'argon's Kingdom couldn't match their transcendent might. A generation later the sahuagin returned, and the elves retaliated, using the divine power of the Undying Court to seize the Sha'argon border fortresses. It was at this time--when the region claimed included both sahuagin and locathah lands--that the elves officially declared it the Valraean Protectorate. According to the proclamation, the Undying Court would protect all peoples of the Protectorate and the line of Valraea would provide them with guidance and security... all of which was a gentle way of saying that the people were now under Aereni rule and would be forced to embrace Aereni customs. While this decision was driven in part by a desire to ensure the island's security, it may have also been tied to the discovery of dragonshard deposits along the seabed--both fallen Siberys shards and indications of deep Khyber shards.",
										"The next thousand years brought chaos, as the sahuagin--first Sha'argon's Kingdom, then the Eternal Dominion--continued to attack and the Valraean elves continued to retaliate by conquering additional sahuagin territories. But the power of the Undying Court is geographically limited. While clerics can draw on the power of the Court to cast spells anywhere in the world, the transcendent might that can repel dragons or defeat sahuagin armies has a limited range. When the elves pressed beyond that, they suffered terrible losses; and yet, the Dominion couldn't challenge the elves within the Court's sphere of influence. This began a long stalemate that continues to this day. The Eternal Dominion has launched numerous attacks over the last few centuries, testing the power of the Undying Court, but thus far, the might of the deathless has been sufficient to repel every sahuagin assault.",

												"Most subjects of the Valraean Protectorate are locathah and sahuagin; despite this, the Protectorate is modeled after Aereni society in many ways. In Aerenal, any elf can prove themselves worthy of joining the noble line. In the Protectorate, subjects likewise strive to prove their worth--but in this case, they seek to be worthy of {@i serving} the elves of the noble line. Valraean subjects are raised to believe that all elves are semidivine beings. They're ancient and wise, masters of powerful magic and remarkable skills... and most importantly, only elves can ascend to join the Undying Court.",
												"The sea elves of the line of Valraea live in the midst of this enforced adulation. They're idolized and adored from birth, and have been playing the role of divine guardians and guides for so long that many have come to believe it: they {@i were} shaped by the Undying Court to be the guardians of the sea, and they do stand above their adoring subjects. But while the Valraean sea elves are often arrogant and overconfident, they generally strive to live up to that vision, to protect anyone in their charge, to be the noble and gracious rulers that (most of) their subjects imagine them to be. They aren't petty tyrants; they believe in ensuring the safety and security of their people--but they also feel no qualms about the fact that their subjects are ultimately trapped in their lives, with all positions of power held by sea elves. They consider their privilege logical and natural; and so do the overwhelming majority of Valraean subjects, who believe the elves, with their long lives and deathless ancestors, are more capable than other mortals could ever be with their fleeting lifespans.",
												"Meanwhile, Valraean subjects believe they too are elevated above all outsiders, lower than the elves, but still blessed to receive the guidance of the elves and the living (or rather, deathless) gods of the Undying Court. And most subjects strive to prove themselves worthy of this blessing. All subjects of the Protectorate receive an education and learn trades. Its people engage in simple industry that no Aereni elf wants to dirty their hands with, as well as laboring to provide an important source of dragonshards for the mainland. In all of this, Valraeans are generally honest and industrious, trying to emulate the Aereni and perfect their skills; but they're taught that they'll never be as gifted as elves, since an Aereni elf spends an entire locathah lifetime in just their initial studies. This reflects the cornerstone of Valraean culture, which is, boiled down, that {@i elves are glorious and better at everything than you}. As a Valraean you're just lucky to be near elves, to have their guidance and protection. It's your duty to honor the Undying Court, because without it, you would be torn apart by the vicious sahuagin in the cruel world outside the Protectorate. And while no non-elf has ever proven worthy to join the Undying Court--how could they, with a paltry century to perfect their skills--maybe, just {@i maybe}, if you keep working hard enough and become the best person you can be, you might be the first.",
												"虽然瓦拉亚家族的许多成员相信他们自己的宣传，但简单的事实是，仁慈的保护国是一个压迫性的政权，有时甚至是残酷的。长期以来，瓦拉亚一系一直致力于消除所有本土文化的痕迹，用精灵语取代当地语言，并消除了Locathah宗教。很少有臣民公开挑战精灵的统治，但那些挑战者很快就会被压制。但是，尽管有这些努力，群众中还是有一些人抵制瓦拉恩的宣传，并寻求恢复和保护他们的古老传统。反叛的萨瓦金人可能与马伦蒂合作，并支持多米尼克的间谍活动。locathah的道路更加艰难，因为对他们这种人来说，在多米尼克的生活会比在保护国的生活更加糟糕。但locathah的抵抗力量仍然坚持着希望，相信只要他们的内心是自由的，他们就有可能找到推翻所有暴君的方法。",

For example, Lamannia needs mortal beasts to tell its story; birth, growth, and even death are part of its concept, and reflecting that requires a mortal population."

For example, in Shavarath, devils embody the concept of war fought in pursuit of tyranny, while angels are living symbols of the endless fight for justice. The name \"immortal\" doesn't mean \"unkillable\"--they can indeed be killed (as discussed in the \"Killing Immortals\" sidebar). While immortals don't show the effects of age, some have a limited lifespan and can die a natural death as well. However, their {@i essence} is immortal and their numbers remain constant.",
														"Most immortals don't care about Eberron. Many consider Eberron to be an unfinished experiment, while their realm is the finished, perfected work of the Progenitors. Others simply believe in their purpose to the exclusion of all other things; to the angel of Shavarath, the eternal battle is the single most important struggle in the multiverse, and leaving their post for even an instant could give the enemy an advantage. So most immortals aren't concerned with the fates of mortals or their civilizations; of course mortals may die, that's their most defining feature. An angel has seen many human civilizations rise and fall--what's one more? While there are a few exceptions--immortals who chose to dwell on Eberron, whether to prey on mortals, observe them, or assist them--immortals are generally bound to their planes, and your problems are not their problems.",

												"Eberron is the Material Plane, bound by the logical limitations that govern material things. However, its thirteen planes are ideas, and these are potentially limitless. With this in mind, the planes of Eberron are divided into layers--distinct environments or realms that aren't bound by the laws of physical space nor physically connected. These layers can be tiny, seemingly infinite, or anything in between. A desert may wrap back upon itself, the alleys in a city could twist in impossible ways to always return you to the main square, or you could come to an absolute edge, where everything falls away into an endless void.",
												"Many scholars--including Dorius Alyre ir'Korran in his celebrated {@i Planar Codex}--describe the layers of a plane as a stack; however, the planes of Eberron aren't physically arranged in a particular order, and there's no concept of a top or bottom layer. Instead, each layer explores a different facet of the core concept that defines the plane. Lamannia is the Plane of Nature, and each layer showcases a particular environment--there's an endless ocean, a vast forest, a volcano forever on the edge of erupting. Shavarath is the Plane of War, and each layer contains a different aspect of war--a bitter siege, a bloody melee, a lingering guerilla conflict. Some planes have a core layer that serves as the heart of the plane, such as the Amaranthine Cities of Mabar and Irian. But the layers of Lamannia are all equal in importance.",
												"While they aren't stacked, most planes have layers bound by a reliable set of connections. The shape of these connections varies based on the plane. Some are obvious: a massive door sitting in the desert, a pool that reflects a scene from another layer. Others are more subtle; if you come upon an island while sailing on the Endless Ocean of Lamannia and you walk inland, you'll find that the island is a completely different layer--and when you turn around, the ocean is no longer behind you. A portal doesn't have to be physical at all; in Thelanis, you can travel to a new layer by acting out the elements of a new story.",
												"本章为每个平面提供了值得注意的层的例子，但这些只是一个样本。就像想法没有限制一样，一个平面可以包含的层数也没有限制。在开发或描述一个适合你的故事的层时，要牢牢记住平面的核心概念。伊里安的阿玛兰辛城的巨大堡垒要塞与沙瓦拉斯的堡垒有什么不同？沙瓦拉斯的堡垒是关于战争的；石头被磨损了，空气中弥漫着血和烟的气味。在伊里安，要塞是希望的象征，是一个正在崛起的帝国；它明亮、干净，而且可能从未见过一场真正的战斗。因此，虽然两个平面的层次最初可能听起来很相似，但回过头来看看核心概念，并考虑这如何反映在每一层中。"

Other DMs might prefer to have concretely established cycles, which can add their own interesting flavor to an adventure. For example, Mabar is always coterminous on the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice, a time known as Long Shadows. On these nights, friends and family gather together and keep lights burning through the night. With this in mind, this chapter does discuss the traditional cycle of each plane, when it's reliably coterminous or remote--just remember the cycles are there to enhance your story, not limit it!"

But there's a further complication, because the moons are also tied to the planes, as indicated on the Planar Destinations and Moons table.

So while unusual, it's possible for there to be two or three ascendant moons at a time if multiple coterminous periods converge.",

It may be fixed in a single phase--such as in Lamannia, where the moon is always full--or its phase might even change from layer to layer.

This is one reason the overlords can't be permanently destroyed; each is part of the architecture of Khyber itself, and the overlord's form that can be encountered in Eberron is simply a projection of its essence.

But there's a catch: every dream ends when the dreamer wakes up. Forty thousand years ago, the giants of Xen'drik fought a war with Dal Quor--but none of the current quori remember this war or anything that happened before it. They believe this is because the Quor Tarai came to an end.

Meanwhile, the agents of the Dreaming Dark believe they can permanently anchor the Quor Tarai in the current age, if only they can control enough mortal dreams--a process begun with Sarlona. It's up to the DM to decide if the kalashtar can usher in a new age over the course of the campaign, or if the Dreaming Dark will maintain the status quo. If the Turning of the Age occurs, all existing quori will be destroyed and reborn; no one knows what this will do to the kalashtar or foreign creations like the Uul Dhakaan."

Ghosts that are destroyed eventually reform; they can only find peace if their unfinished business is resolved.",

It often takes the presence of a mortal to trigger it; when this occurs, the lingering pain and hate coalesces into a solid form. The least of these are lemures, formed from hateful memories or deeds. The emotional residue of hundreds or thousands of people can form deadly sorrowsworn--the Angry, the Hungry, the Lonely, the Lost, and the Wretched--as presented in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}.

										"Returning life to the dead isn't a reliable service in Eberron. Many characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, from clerics to adepts of House Jorasco. But just because a spell {@i can} be cast doesn't mean that it {@i should} be cast... or that it will work if it does. The first and simplest limitation is time. The longer a spirit remains in Dolurrh, the more it falls under the sway of ennui. Any spell that returns life to the dead requires the spirit to {@i want} to return. Once the shade becomes a husk, it can no longer make that decision, and thus can't be raised or reincarnated. Most religions maintain that this happens because the true soul has moved on to a higher level of existence; who wants to be pulled back from a union with the Sovereigns? So you only have about a week or two--depending on the strength of the target's will--to pull them back. But even before that time, a spirit might choose not to return. What do they have to live for? Is it worth fighting the lulling ennui of Dolurrh?",
										"The second limitation is risk. Even if a spell is successful, Jorasco remains rightly concerned about whether that person is {@i supposed} to come back, or if it's their time to die--for if it's the latter, a marut may appear to challenge any resurrection. This is extraordinarily rare, but in part, that's because healers perform an {@spell augury} ritual beforehand and refuse to raise someone if there's a risk. Even if a marut doesn't intervene, there's a risk the resurrection could go poorly if Dolurrh is coterminous, perhaps calling back other spirits in addition to--or instead of--the person being brought back to life.",
										"最后的限制是更高力量的直接干预。亡灵女王可能会使一个阴魂结晶，阻止它被恢复，或者抓住一个即将被恢复的阴魂，为它的通过设定一个价格；在生命成本表中给出了几个例子。受益人有多长时间来结清他们的帐？一天，一年，还是一生？还有人说，守护者可以在灵魂到达多鲁尔之前抢走它们；如果这个神话是真的，那么这些灵魂只能从恶魔荒原的守护者巢穴中找回。守护者本身可能在那里，也可能不在那里，但它肯定是一个强大的龙人的住所！\"。",
										"The flip side of direct intervention is that the Queen of the Dead (or another powerful entity) might offer to return a shade to life--for a price. This is a way to bring a low-level character back to life, despite their friends being unable to afford resurrection. {@table The Cost of a Life|ExploringEberron} table provides ideas.",
										"If all else fails, there's one way you can always bring someone to life: go to Dolurrh, find their shade, and drag it back out to the Material Plane. It's simple--all you need to do is to locate a single soul in the endless Catacombs (perhaps with the help of a native guide, records in the Vault of Memories, or powerful divination magic), evade Dolurrh's many guardians, and return to Eberron with the soul in tow. If you succeed, the victim receives a new body, just as if you'd cast {@spell true resurrection}; and while Dolurrh's defenders will try to stop you from leaving, they won't interfere once you return to Eberron. It's theoretically possible to restore a husk in this way as well, though the resurrected husk generally won't regain its lost memories, even though it might learn new skills. As a result, it wouldn't do any good to bring back the Tairnadal ancestors or Galifar I; you could bring a {@i body} back to life, but it's not the original person in any meaningful way. This is why the Queen of the Dead (and perhaps the Keeper) preserves certain shades from decay--so that they might one day be restored, even after thousands of years."

Mortal inhabitants of the fragment are typically transformed into shadows or other forms of undead, while immortals might become yugoloths, or twisted into dark mockeries of their former selves. The conversion is slow and inevitable, and the Dark Powers of Mabar don't have to take any action--but regardless, most enjoy tormenting the fragments.

The Odakyr Rites that create Karrnathi undead are an example of this, and the Karrnathi city of Atur is built on a Mabaran zone. This often has a curious synergy: if the negative energy of a Mabaran manifest zone is regularly channeled into rituals or spells, it prevents that energy from spreading disease or killing vegetation. {@i In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy}, Jolan Hass Holan asserts that the plagues and famines Karrnath suffered early in the war were due to the Seekers who normally tended those zones being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns--which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace necromancy to counter the effects of those famines.",

								"Risia is known as the Plain of Ice, for that's the vast majority of what's found within it. Risia is defined by endless arctic wastes, and what appear to be mountains are just peaks of solid ice. But like Fernia, Risia's appearance can be deceiving. Because it's filled with glaciers and snow, many sages assume that this is its defining principle. But in Lamannia, there are also endless blizzards and majestic glaciers--ice in its natural state. By comparison, the core ideas that define Risia are isolation, stagnation, and preservation. The endless frozen plane isn't about snow, it's about the utter stillness, the empty and unchanging landscape. Risia is sparsely populated, because that's the point of it; it's bleak and lonely, a realm in which you could walk for days and never see another creature. Where a desert of sand can at least shift in the breeze, the frozen landscape of Risia is unchanging. Yet, unlike a stone plateau, it reflects a substance that could change at one point--but is now caught, frozen, stagnant.",
								"Though this isolated and unchanging plane might not seem appealing to adventurers, it's important to remember that the plane represents preservation--and ancient secrets forgotten for ages could be frozen within the ice. And while the realm itself is barren, it's not completely deserted; over millennia, hardy creatures have come to Risia and settled in this desolate realm.",

This greatest power of the plane of isolation is uninterested in being known, and has never interacted directly with outsiders, but its presence can be felt through its manifestations. These include bheur hags, frost salamanders, ice devils, chain devils, and the Lonely (sorrowsworn).

The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, \"Why continue to fight? Why not just leave the struggle and do something--anything--else?\" In particular, it's common for mortals to see the vast resources the celestials devote to the war and protest, \"Why don't you help us? You claim to be the Legion of Justice, but innocent people are dying in Thaliost while you fight this meaningless war!\"",

Each spire is ruled by an archfey, and each has a distinct story that shapes the personality of the local eladrin. The eladrin aren't as bound by story as other fey, but the magic of the plane encourages a deep devotion to their spire and their ruler. They hunt, they hold revels, they serve their ruler in the intrigues of the Moon Court; it rarely occurs to them that there could be more to life. However, they're indeed mortals; they fall in love, they have children, they are born, and they die. If an eladrin leaves their spire--whether to roam across Thelanis or into Eberron--they often gain a greater appreciation of the passage of time. Living among mortals in a mundane world can be a hard transition for an eladrin; compared to the wonders of the Faerie Court, there is little fey beauty in Khorvaire. The longer an eladrin lives in the mortal world, the more mortal it becomes; this is why eladrin player characters are considered humanoids (and elves) rather than fey.",

She's the villain of the Sleeping Prince, but she also curses those who steal from her secret garden, and may have advice for those who approach her carefully and with gifts. In some cases, stories refer to the archfey by name. When something goes missing in the Five Nations, people in Eberron know the Forgotten Prince stole it; his story is explored in chapter 8. Other archfey inspire tales, but those stories are seen through a local lens. The Lady in Shadow set the story of the Sleeping Prince in motion long ago, but in Eberron, the villain of the story is Lady Narathun, or Hezhaal the dirge singer, or Sora Katra.

Typically, an archfey wants its agents to take actions relating to its story; the Forgotten Prince charges his agents to steal secrets and unloved things. Others don't want agents; they want mortals to reenact their stories, as in many versions of the Sleeping Prince. Hezhaal the dirge singer really did curse the marhu's son long ago, and Sora Katra is another real person who just happens to resemble the Lady in Shadow in some ways. Neither Katra nor Hezhaal knowingly served the Lady in Shadow--but she may have secretly aided them, or placed gifts or obstacles in their paths that might make them reenact the stories, unknowingly becoming avatars of the archfey. Archfey can't be permanently killed; as long as their stories are told, the archfey will reform. However, this usually involves a greater fey being promoted to fill the role; the archfey still exists, but they aren't exactly the same as the one that came before.",

The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer.

For example, each Persuasion or Deception check could be used to convince the dragon to eat its own hoard, with each successful check reducing its hit points until it bursts. This is a place where wits are more important than brawn, though it may take time for the adventurers to discover this."

												"More than with any other plane, Thelanian manifest zones often allow travel between the planes. Fey creatures dwell in such zones, and a greater fey may turn such a manifest zone into its personal domain. Just as fey can cross over from Thelanis, mortals can travel to the Faerie Court. Gateway zones always share the general environment of the layer they are connected to, though it's rarely obvious when this passage occurs, and it may take time for travelers to realize they have crossed over. However, there are always signs of a gateway--circles of mushrooms, strange patterns of vegetation, eerie lights, or faint, unearthly music the adventurers must follow. Gateways typically only activate at certain times--often when the moon Rhaan is full--and even then, there's usually something that must be done that violates a known superstition. If you stay on the path in the forest, you won't stumble into the Endless Weald. But if you follow the ghostly music, or chase the silvery deer? That's on you.",
												"Other manifest zones reflect the properties and influence of Thelanis without allowing passage between worlds. Zones with the Enchanted Realm property are much sought after by House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Zones with Storybook Logic break the rules of reality in specific ways; the Grove of Promises is a clearing that holds an old stone fountain. Stories from the nearby village say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain, you must keep your word--and if you are false, you'll sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove... will you?",
												"A final form of manifest zone is the beachhead; this phenomenon periodically draws a piece of Thelanis into Eberron. The feyspires mentioned earlier are an example of this, but a beachhead can be any unusual location--sure to be a local legend, but rarely be found by those searching for it, only uncovered by chance. There's a tale in the Mror Holds of the Tomb of the Forgotten King, found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in an ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, guardians patrol the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others, there are deadly traps. But one detail remains the same throughout all the tales: treasures taken from the tomb always bring misfortune, bestowing curses that linger until the thief finds the tomb again and returns what they have stolen... or until they die."

The plane's title, \"Realm of Madness,\" is a label applied by the people of Eberron based on the perception that close interaction with Xoriat can interfere with your ability to process reality. But illithids call Xoriat the Realm of Revelations... and this may be more accurate. Where Lamannia embodies the natural world, Xoriat instead embodies the unnatural. It's a window into the workings of reality that mortals normally don't see, ones they're ill-equipped to handle. It suggests that time and space, order and chaos, war and peace--all of these are inventions. They're the foundations mortal lives are built on... but what lies under those foundations? What was there before the house was built, and what will come after? Xoriat holds the answers to those questions, and infinitely more as well.",
								"Though the fact is often overlooked, all mortals have a connection to Xoriat. Mortals dream in Dal Quor. Shavarath sparks mortal anger. Mabar feeds mortal shadows, while Irian holds their spark of light. When mortals die, their souls are drawn to Dolurrh. Mortals are influenced by all of the planes, and the influence of Xoriat drives the desire to question reality. It can be a source of inspiration, especially for artists; it helps people challenge their assumptions and see things in an entirely new way. But Xoriat's also the sun that melts the wings of any who draw too close. From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn't evil or destructive. It's part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Irian brings life, Lamannia is the blueprint for nature, Daanvi provides guiding order.

It's a roadmap to the maze, revealing that if you take a left turn at \"Queen Aurala is assassinated\" and then turn right at \"Breland becomes a democracy,\" you'll reach \"Sul Khatesh is released from her prison.\" The Prophecy shows the path you need to take to achieve the outcome you desire--a map to the many possibilities of the future.",

They could find themselves in the Empire of Dhakaan, or in the midst of the War of the Mark. And in the process, they could change the future. Perhaps they help Halas Tarkanan win the War of the Mark; the dragonmarked houses are broken and scattered before they ever achieve their current glory, and people with aberrant dragonmarks thrive. With these changes, modern Khorvaire would be a very different place. In doing this, the adventurers have dropped a new rat in the maze. This new rat becomes the Prime Material Plane. It snatches the old rat's crown of planes, becoming the reality where all the planes converge and where time moves forward. But the other rat is still out there--forgotten and lost, huddled in a corner, but still alive. And it's possible that if the adventurers return to Xoriat, they could change their mind; they could find their way back to that original rat, returning it to its role as the Prime Material Plane. So Xoriat gives the possibility for dramatic change--but it's always possible to restore a forgotten past.",

But others might say that this is in keeping with the myth of the Progenitors. Irian is the beginning, Mabar is the end--and Xoriat could be the point that stands above the journey, the high perch from which the Progenitors could study their work. Xoriat isn't bound by the laws that bind the rest of the planes, and it holds all the ideas that were discarded. Perhaps the Sovereigns didn't entirely build reality, but rather, they {@i sculpted} it--chipping things away and dropping them into Xoriat.",
												"This is a metaphysical discussion that most adventurers will never need to worry about. There are three things to take away from it. Xoriat is a point from which history and reality itself can be changed. The daelkyr have changed it an unknown number of times.

Dyrrn the Corruptor, Valaara, Belashyrra--each dwells in a domain in Xoriat, attended by their servants and their armies. This ties to Xoriat's uncanny relationship with time. The daelkyr may be in Xoriat because they haven't left yet, or they might've already been released from their prisons and returned to Xoriat. Again, if time is a maze, the daelkyr stand above it looking down--but at the same time, they are also running in the maze. They can't return to Eberron now, because they're already there; but this may be why they seem unconcerned with their long imprisonment, because they're also watching it all unfold from above. So adventurers could interact with any of the daelkyr in Xoriat, but fighting them there won't impact their actions on Eberron.

Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren't overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases--such as the {@i storm spires} of House Lyrandar and the {@i creation forges} of House Cannith--the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.",

In addition, you could have a dragonmark focus item that produces the same effect as an existing magic item from the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|ERLW}--except it can't be used or attuned unless you possess a particular dragonmark. House Lyrandar is working on a version of a {@item broom of flying} for dragonmarked heirs, though they haven't perfected it yet. House Ghallanda is developing a {@i portable inn}--a version of the {@item Daern's Instant Fortress||instant fortress}--but it's proven difficult.

These rarest and most powerful of dragonmarks are known as Siberys dragonmarks. They are larger and have a far more complex pattern than do other dragonmarks. Typically, a Siberys dragonmark evolves from an existing mark, following a dire situation in which the bearer performs a remarkable feat related to the abilities of their developing mark. However, on even rarer occasion, someone spontaneously manifests a massive, powerful dragonmark despite having never possessed a lesser one.",

A character who displays such a mark is treated with more respect by other members of the house, but the barons and seneschals may also place greater demands on them. So a Siberys dragonmark is a blessing, but it can also be a burden. The manifestation of a Siberys dragonmark--especially one appearing spontaneously on an unmarked character--can be a sign that the bearer has an important role in the Draconic Prophecy, as well as a warning that dragons, fiends, and other powerful forces may try to manipulate or harm the character.",

These things may not be seen as valuable by the people that possess them, and such a task could easily be added on top of the mission for an existing adventure--\"While you're in Dreadhold, steal the ring under the warden's bed.\" The Prince could teach his agents a ten-minute ritual which allows him to pull the requested item into Thelanis (this only works with objects the Prince wants, so it's not a way to dispose of just any item). The Prince may also task agents with actions to expose or bring down people whose reputations are undeserved, or to assist those who are unappreciated.

					"To date, no one knows the origin or purpose--if any--of the ruinbound dwarves. Doldarun asserts that they are children corrupted by Dyrrn in the womb, tools of the daelkyr waiting to be activated. The sages of Clan Narathun say that they may indeed be the result of strange forces emanating from the Realm Below, but there's no evidence that the children have any direct tie to the daelkyr or that they're drawn to malefic actions. Regardless of the truth, ruinbound dwarves are a recent development. The first ruinbound children were born thirty years ago, and traditionally, dwarves aren't even considered to be adults until their fiftieth year; however, ruinbound children mature surprisingly (some say unnaturally) quickly.",
					"Ruinbound dwarves are quite rare and can be born to dwarves of any bloodline. The Mror still don't know what to make of them, though their attitude toward symbionts generally mirrors that toward ruinbound dwarves. The Doldarun dwarves are hostile to any ruinbounds that come to their land, and claim that ruinbound children are never born in their clan; while that's a possibility, there are also rumors of Soldorak agents among the Doldarun that spirit away these infants to a clan that celebrates them, lest they meet a darker fate. The Droranath and Toldorath clans are curious, but they won't necessarily ostracize ruinbound dwarves. Soldorak and Narathun families might embrace a ruinbound child--but they also might reject them out of fear that other clans could use them to paint the entire family as corrupted. In creating a ruinbound character, you need to decide how you were received, reflected by your background. Are you an urchin or an outlander, having made your own way after being rejected by your family? Are you a charlatan or a criminal, forced down a dangerous path by the fears of those around you? Or might you be a noble, treasured by your family despite--or because of--your condition?",
					"As a ruinbound dwarf, you could also choose to attribute your class abilities to your symbiont or your unnatural nature. As a sorcerer, your spellcasting could be channeled through your symbiont or other mutations. Any class with Unarmored Defense could present it as being tied to a physical mutation; if you're a barbarian, your rage could manifest as an active transformation. If you're a ruinbound warlock, you could say that your symbiont is your patron, an active sentience within you--and if you help it grow, it promises you greater powers.",
					"虽然其他人可能会害怕他们，但废墟中的矮人并不是天生的邪恶。在创建废墟角色时，与你的管理员讨论你想让你的故事走向哪里。你想面对腐败的威胁吗？Dyrrn有没有可能对你有计划？或者你想成为一个真正的英雄，尽管你看起来很阴险的特点？"

				"As a traveler, you have learned a secret language that allows you to silently convey messages to fellow changelings. This is an exotic language that can only be 'spoken' by changelings, though members of other species can learn to understand it. Skin cant uses shifting patterns of scars, tattoos, and pigment. This allows you to convey a short message--a concept that can be expressed in six words or less--to anyone who knows the language and who can see you. Typically the message is something you maintain as part of your appearance; for example, in crafting your image, you might add a pattern of scars that tells other changeling travelers, 'I need help' or 'Everything I say is a lie.'",
				"You can also use this language to have a conversation--typically by manifesting symbols on the palm of your hand--with someone who is within 60 feet and able to see you. The shifting patterns can be noticed by other observers within 60 feet; if you wish to keep the conversation discrete, you can hide it with a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check opposed by the observer's Wisdom ({@skill Perception} or {@skill Insight}) check. If you fail, it means the observer notices your shifting patterns, though they don't understand the meaning unless they also know skin cant."
