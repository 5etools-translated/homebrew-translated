										"当这些对自然的憎恶侵入五人的创作时，各方面都惊恐地看着。怪物和人类都被屠杀，森林在燃烧，山脉被拆毁，海洋变成了沙子。古代人的战争已经开始。"

								"有了上面读到的所有信息，让我们举个例子，看看你在游戏开始时可能会看到什么，以及这一切是如何进行的。",
								"康拉德是一个2级战士，刚刚杀死了他的第一个{@creature great jagras|MHMM}(第68页MHMM)，他现在挥舞着一把普通的{@item great sword|AGMH}，穿着{@item chain mail|PHB}（他的起始装备中得到的），腰带上挂着一个小小的银色乌鸦图标（他的{@item Trinket|PHB}）。",
								"康拉德为他的第一次杀戮感到兴奋，他试图雕刻大蟒蛇以获得一些他可能会用到的材料。然后，GM在《怪物猎人战利品表》PDF中查找大黄鼠狼，看看Conrad能在这个生物上尝试多少次雕刻。在这种情况下，我们可以看到下面这个大锯齿的战利品表。从表的顶部看，康拉德有两次尝试雕刻这个生物的机会（如果他捕获了这个生物，他也会在捕获表上得到两次滚动）。",
								"接下来我们需要确定雕刻检查的DC。在这种情况下，难度是DC12（10+生物CR的1/2，向下取整）。所以康拉德进行了他的第一次智慧（（%0%））检查，结果是13！这是一个成功。一个成功，在成功的基础上我们掷出一个D20。康拉德掷出了14，我们将其与战利品表中的雕刻机会部分进行比较。14分可以让康拉德得到一个大贾格拉斯的鬃毛，这是一种铠甲材料，可以让你不再需要吃喝。",
								"在康拉德的第二次雕刻尝试中，他又进行了一次智慧（（%0%））检查，结果是9。仅仅因为康拉德失败了，并不意味着他没有得到任何东西，相反，失败的结果是你在生物的战利品表上滚动一个1。作为他的第二件物品，康拉德得到了一个伟大的Jagras鳞片，当它被放入盔甲槽时，可以为{@skill Intimidation}检查提供+2的奖励。狩猎完成后，康拉德回到公会并报告他的成功。",
								"在公会里，他想利用他刚刚获得的材料，但他意识到有一个问题。他收集的两种材料都是盔甲材料，而他的普通链甲只有一个插槽。他必须选择将哪种材料放入他的盔甲。经过一番思考和考虑，康拉德决定将大蟒蛇的鬃毛放入他的盔甲中，这样他在适应这个盔甲的时候就不再需要吃喝。",
								"然后他将大锯齿鳞片材料放入他的饰品中，因为它可以容纳1个盔甲或武器材料。这样一来，当他需要更有威慑力的时候，他就可以一直拥有大贾格拉斯鳞片的效果。一旦他找到自己喜欢的材料，他还可以用更强的材料来替换大锯齿鳞片。",
								"{@i Hopefully this walkthrough of the process helps answer any questions you might have. The one thing I will note is that the great jagras is a lower CR creature and as such most of its materials have common magical effects, but as you start to kill stronger and more difficult creatures you will begin to see more powerful materials that you can socket into your armor, trinket, and weapons.}",

When determining how many runes to give the material effect you need to take into consideration many uses keeps it the effect balanced.

The number of runes this type of material has can vary and you can adjust the number as you see fit, though most often it has 5 (rare or lower rarity) or 10 charges (rare or higher rarity). The goal behind this material type, is to allow 3-5+ uses before it needs to recharge. This is accomplished by having different rune costs for each effect.",

												"The heart of the tree was carved out, forming almost a cave and unidentified fungi grew from the ground. I decided to proceed in. That's when I heard a child like laugh. I was shocked and forgot to breathe, and started to walk tip-toe. I thought that maybe, just maybe it was... it was... a ghost...?",
												"But it turned out to be a mob of Shakalakas! They're about half the size of a human, but they sure are prone to violence. I had unwittingly stumbled right into one of their meetings! The one with the crown, the king, issued a command in a loud voice. I don't speak their language, but I didn't have to for this!",
												"In a flash, all of the Shakalaka there turned and charged at me, waving their hatchets in the air! It was then I understood that the child's voice I heard earlier was actually the voice of a Shakalaka. What a way to learn. As I ran with all my might, I scribbled some notes down about my discovery. Awesome, right?",
												"Just as the sun was setting, I had a brush with death. This time, it was a large black shadow that appeared before me. It had a low voice, glistening blood-red eyes, a monster's physique, and fangs sharper than the sharpest blades... People say that once spotted, that's it. The end. I couldn't believe it. How could I have run into one...?",
												"Things turned out alright in the end, though. And that is how my first research trip came to an exciting end. Field research is really though and I still have no idea what you meant by what you told me. Hmm... But I swear to try harder next time!",

					"Khezu are large, pale Wyverns with a flabby, rubbery hide which they constantly keep damp, similar to that of an amphibian. Many of their blood vessels and veins can be seen through their pale skin. Their tail features a specialized orifice which bonds to the ground during electrical attacks and helps them cling onto cave ceilings. Their mouth features rows of sharp teeth. Khezu feet lack claws, and instead have suction pad-like toes to assist them in climbing and hanging from cave walls and ceilings. Spending most of their lives in the dark, their eyes have regressed greatly, though they make up for this with a superb sense of smell. A layer of fat helps to keep them warm and prolong the time they can spend hunting for food. Khezu have an extendable neck which allows them to grasp and ambush prey from afar, such as from a cave ceiling. Khezu are hermaphrodites, which means an individual is both male and female. To reproduce they paralyze a creature and inject their young, known as Whelps. The Whelps grow inside their victim until it dies, or when they are strong enough to leave.",
					"Although Khezu are cave dwellers, they go out when they please, or when food inside grows too scarce. While Khezu outside a cave are vulnerable to larger Wyverns like Tigrex, inside caves Khezu have the advantage. In addition to being unhampered by the dark, they can cling to the ceiling and attack from above.",
					"A Khezu's habitat is often located near active sources of water; some sources claim this is because the water is excellent for conducting electricity into their prey, while others speculate that Khezu may need the dampness for their moist skin. Such areas include swamps and oceanside caves."
