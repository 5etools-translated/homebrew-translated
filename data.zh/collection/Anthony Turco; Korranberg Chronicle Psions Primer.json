This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.",

				"A {@i power stone} is a Siberys dragonshard similar to a {@item spellshard|ERLW}, but instead of containing text or a wizard's spellbook, it is imprinted with the knowledge of one psionic power a class has access to and the psi points required to manifest it once. You become aware of the power and the number of psi points imprinted in the stone when you learn the stone's properties.",
				"While holding the stone, you can manifest or cast the power from it as an action if the power is either a talent on your class list or a power that augments a talent on your class list. If the power is an augment, you spend all of the psi points imprinted on the stone to manifest it instead of your own psi points, and you may manifest it even if you are not focusing on the appropriate psionic talent listed in the power. Once the power is cast or manifested, the imprint of the power and all psi points disappear from the stone.",
				"If the number of psi points the {@i power stone} contains is greater than your psi limit, you must make an ability check using your psionic ability to determine whether you manifest the stone's power successfully. The DC equals 10 + half the psi points contained in the stone (round up). On a failed check, the power and psi points disappear from the stone with no other effect.",

To do so, you manifest or cast the power while holding the stone. The power and any psi points spent to manifest it are stored in the stone instead of having any effect. Casting or manifesting the power must require either 1 action, 1 bonus action, or 1 minute or longer, and you cannot spend more psi points to manifest the stored power than the stone's maximum psi point capacity.",

The people of Khalesh were righteous and just\u2014at least, according to them\u2014and channeled holy power to crusade against the evils of their time. Sages of the Library of Korranberg have identified Khalesh's ancient religion as a \"serpent cult,\" worshiping the celestial couatl and venerating their fight against the demonic forces of Khyber. Unbeknown to Khalesh's greater population, however, the champions and nobles of their society were infused with the essence of couatls themselves, becoming the shulassakar, whose bloodlines were bestowed with several traits associated with their serpentine idols\u2014some more noticeable than others.

It is whispered among the Adarans that the unbodied are the cursed monks of an ancient monastery that existed long before the kalashtar and Inspired came to Sarlona. The mystic leaders of this monastery guided the others in a meditation to manifest a communal psionic power unknown to modern day psions and mystics, one that promised all who participated in it true enlightenment. When the ritual was completed, the monks indeed cast off their mortal bodies, but rather than transcending to a higher realm of existence, their consciousnesses became mired in the physical realm. Divested of their mortal bodies, but not their mortal wants and needs, they now wander aimlessly, unable to attain the enlightenment they desired."

To these contrarians, the unbodied are not evidence of a failed ritual, but rather a sign of its success. The monks who transcended divested themselves not only of their physical bodies, but also their desires. These desires now float, independent and bodiless, on their own. The higher consciousnesses of those ancient monks, thus free of all desire, were able to transcend mortal existence. To proponents of this version of the tale, the ancient psionic ritual of the unbodied remains the promise of true enlightenment, and they seek the location of the time-lost monastery in which the psionic ritual was manifested for clues on how to reenact it."

Sentient nightmares that are planning world domination and pretending to be enlightened individuals bringing us vital, humanitarian aid? Sorry, but unless you have some actual proof...\"}",
						"{@i The woman on the other side of the table, contriving to look calm despite the developing bar brawl building in the Lhazaar tavern, tilted her head with the same faint smile she'd worn throughout the conversation. She leaned forward, resting her elbow on the table, and with a flash of light from her eyes and chest, a blade of radiant blue energy appeared around her hand. \"Will this qualify?\"}",
						"{@i \"Minor illusio\u2014\" Rhen replied, before the blade was brought down to cut his mug, a cheap, wooden thing he'd suspected was leaking, into two neat pieces. \"\u2014cannot do that.\" He stared at the useless halves of the mug on the table, frowning despite his lack of enthusiasm for the swill that used to be in the mug when it was whole.}",
						"{@i \"Would you need more evidence that what I am here to tell you is not of your arcanism?\" Evatana dismissed her blade as Rhen debated whether another drink was worth trying to get the bartender's attention. \"Very few of my people would even consider offering an outsider any of this information at all.\"}",
						"{@i Glancing over to the corner where Ardiane had settled herself to watch the meeting, Rhen nodded in acknowledgement, then flagged down the bartender for another mug of ale, deciding he did, in fact, need something to help him take this all in. \"Then why now and why me?\" He could feel Ardiane's eyes burning the back of his skull, despite her being several feet away and possessed of no such magical gaze abilities. He knew she was carefully watching for any trickery on Evatana's part.}",
						"{@i A growl from another section of the tavern drew his attention in that direction, but he didn't miss Evatana's next words. \"I believe that the people of these lands can be made allies rather than left as ignorant lambs before the onslaught of the Darkness.\"}",
						"{@i She followed his gaze as well, where a Jorash'tar half-orc from the Mror Holds had drawn the attention of a Lhazaarite pirate who'd gotten too close. The Mror lowlander lifted the offender off the ground, growling in his face. The pirate's friends came to his defense, and soon the area around the bar was a flurry of splinters and punches. \"This is what they will do,\" Evatana gestured broadly at the room, \"but on a grander scale. They will divide your people, let them fight themselves, and when you are weak, they will come as saviors.\"}",
						"{@i Rhen paused, looking suspiciously at the woman, then gestured to the bar brawl. \"This isn't your influence, is it?\" Evatana shook her head, both in answer and, apparently, to warn off Ardiane. \"So these quori are just waiting for us to destroy ourselves in some sort of apocalyptic war...\" A chill ran down his spine, and he put his head in his hands.}",
						"{@i Evatana gave him a moment, in which Ardiane abandoned all subtlety to sit next to him, glaring at Evatana suspiciously as she put an arm around his waist. \"Yes,\" Evatana replied. \"Whether or not they had a hand in its beginning, you were never so vulnerable as you are now. Certainly, their hidden hands seek to renew the destruction of the Last War.\"}",
						"{@i \"And I just happen to be in the right place for you to pass this message on?\" Rhen looked up, taking a deep gulp from the new mug. \"They're eating at the fractures, and these ‘psionic powers' are what they're using to do it.\" He coughed as the unexpectedly strong Lhazaar alcohol burned the back of his throat. How strong was the ale here? \"Then you're right. Tell me about the quori and how we can fight their designs. I don't know if we can, but...\"}",
						"{@i Evatana offered a small smile. \"Your people fight horrors like this all the time. Psionic powers are not as foreign to Khorvaire as you think. Beneath the surface of this land, the mind flayers and their aberrant kin know these techniques too, and despite the taint of this psionic corruption spreading through cults and warped bloodlines, your protectors in the forests fought them and won. It is not a war of blood and steel. This is a war of hearts and righteousness. If you Dream of a better Age, the world will Turn to it.\"}"

The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or roll a d4 to determine what it does during its next turn. On a 1 or 2, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 3 or 4, the creature makes one melee or ranged attack against a random creature it can see other than you, or does nothing if no creature is within reach or range."
