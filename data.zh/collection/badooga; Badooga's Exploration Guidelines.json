That is, the players should establish their expectations and desires for the specific gameplay mechanics they like or dislike, the tone of the story and how involved that story is, and the overall type of game they want to play in. Once this is established during Session Zero, it becomes possible to weave an exciting game of exploration that the players will enjoy, even when the characters in-game might not know what they are in for."

										"Simply put, the game is more fun for the players when they have some information to work with. For example, presenting the party with the choice of \"do you take the left or right path\" is meaningless if they have no idea what either path leads to. However, if the party knows that one path leads through the snowy mountains and the other through the dark forest, this same choice becomes much more important for the party to make.",
										"In general, having proper information gives the party at least some control over the consequences of their choices, making it more satisfying when such choices lead to success. When exploring, the activities that the party can do while traveling can and should grant them some sort of information about the area surrounding them, which in turn allows them to decide which activities they should do next. This gameplay loop defines the core of the exploration pillar, which is defined by discovery and finding new things."

Doesn't this just serve to waste the party's time? Failure shouldn't interrupt progression, and instead should be a catalyst for it. This is the essence of failing forward.",
										"For example, suppose the party is lost in a forest, and keeps failing their rolls to regain their bearings. Instead of having them wander endlessly until they get back on track, allow them to stumble upon a hidden location or path that they otherwise would not have found. This hidden location or path can then lead to plenty of fun adventures, without the immersion of being lost ever breaking."

For example, if one party member decides to keep watch, they might make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check contested by the Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check of the predator that has been stalking them. For other checks, you can set the DC according to how difficult the task is. For example, if a second party member decides to forage for food and water, you can set the DC according to how abundant food and water are in the region.

The former penalty can represent mishaps like getting lost or failing to notice a natural barrier that cannot be passed, and the latter penalty can represent events like participating in combat, suffering from a lack of food and water, or participating in a forced march in order to make up for lost time.",

				"Second, the condition should be used as a way to create more engaging gameplay, but actually does the opposite. For example, suppose the party suffers one level of exhaustion due to a lack of food while exploring. This encourages them to forage for more food, but the very first level of exhaustion already imposes disadvantage on ability checks, making it much harder to succeed at foraging. In other words, the condition encourages a certain action to be taken against it, but simultaneously discourages that action via disadvantage on the check for it.",
				"As another example, consider the trope of a weary traveler suffering from exhaustion while trekking through the snowy mountains, pushing on in hopes of finding some place warm to take shelter in. This trope is a fun one to emulate in D&D, and yet the second level of exhaustion halves your speed, making it much harder to travel at all. The option that should be available\u2014the risky decision of continuing onwards in hopes of succeeding despite the exhaustion\u2014is removed by this effect.",
