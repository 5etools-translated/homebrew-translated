						"亲爱的读者，欢迎来到《Yorviing's Arcane Grimoire》，这本小册子为有史以来最伟大的角色扮演游戏提供了大量的以奥术为主题的玩家选项。在这些页面中，你会发现许多用于巫师的奥术传统、多种法术、魔法物品、卷轴表、背景，以及更多、更多。",
						"本书中的内容旨在为游戏或活动提供许多不同的自制选项。这里有供巫师（甚至还有一些不供巫师使用的）创建角色的子类，赋予施法者和魔法师的法术，可以找到、购买或赠送给玩家的魔法物品，帮助充实角色的背景故事、个性和世界观的卷表，甚至还有地下城主可以纳入他们的世界或活动中的设定中立派别，无论是预先存在的还是玩家可能努力创造或带回的。",

						"首先，这本书要献给我的妻子切尔西，没有她，在我经历一些黑暗时期时，我不会有鼓励和喜悦来继续这个项目。我爱你，小甜豆。",
						"第二，这本书是献给我曾经有幸在一个叫做'Yvarra'的自制世界中管理过的最伟大的玩家的成员；本、白兰地、克里斯、丹、凯文、科里根、马洛里、内森、谢利和塔特。我们有一天会回去的。",
						"第三，这本书要献给r/UnearthedArcana分论坛，感谢他们所有的反馈和支持，以及在Reddit上关注我的任何人。你们都在继续酝酿。",
						"最后，我想先说一下，虽然我在这本书的内容中投入了大量的时间和精力，但肯定会有一些东西不会是完全平衡和完美的。虽然我能够对本书的很多内容进行测试和完善，但有些东西确实会从缝隙中漏掉。我希望任何对本书进行测试的人，从子类到法术，都能通过Reddit让我知道你收集到的任何反馈，从积极的到建设性的批评。",

								"当量子学在未来主义的环境中被实施时，它可以被做成和其他形式的魔法一样普遍，比如唤醒或转化。甚至可以有一个丰富的量子法师传统，被视为等同于驱魔师或魔法师。量子学可以被看作是理解宇宙和万物的亚原子层面的神秘能量的一种方式，因此可能导致对这一魔法流派的使用和研究的学术和神秘的解释。",
								"当Quantumurgy在古老的、中世纪风格的环境中实施时，这个魔法流派可以被看作是巫师们偶然发现的一种新的魔法形式，或者甚至可以是古代的、被遗忘已久的魔法，其他世界的人可能会把它传给那些寻求Quantumurgy力量的人。也许这种魔法是作为一种特殊的恩惠赐予那些为他们的赞助人服务周到的术士。或者，也许量子学是一个只有巫师才能发现的魔法流派，因此只有巫师才能使用这些法术。",
								"目前，除了巫师之外，这些法术并没有列在任何特定的等级上。这有两个原因。第一个原因是这个学派是一个更学术化的学派，因此可能更适合于巫师和潜在的术士。第二个原因是，在他们的环境或世界中使用量子魔法的管理员可以自由地解释这个魔法流派，以及它如何与他们正在运行的东西最匹配。",
								"对于管理员来说，你可以自由地以任何你想要的方式来实施这个新的魔法学派，关于你的活动或设置。如果这个名字在你的世界中不合适，你甚至可以自由地改变这个传统的名称。",

								"{@i Of all the wonders I have seen in my life, none have struck me with a sense of awe more than that of the Ovriel Academy. The first time I laid my eyes upon its multitude of spires, its grand halls, and the rooms upon rooms where all manner of magical experimentation and learning was taking place, my breath was taken away from me. Never has there been an institution so dedicated to the discovery and learning of all things magical. From its lowest levels to its highest towers, students of the arcane were toiling away over ancient tomes, beakers filled with strange liquids and gases, and inscribing spells and sigils upon all manner of materials. My guide, the dear Elistra Alixandre, as part of my tour of the grand keep, took me through a maze of hallways and corridors to a large lecture hall deep underground, where we sat in earnest and wonder at a presentation in which an old orcish wizard displayed his findings on the works of the Yune, the greatest wizard in the land. After which, Elistra showed me a room where students were learning how to summon corpses. Corpses! I was told that no magic is off limits in the Academy to study, so long as it follows particular guidelines. I was amazed at the level of variety and splendid magics that I saw there, and am eagerly looking forward to the day where I can return as a student myself.}",

Her hair, thick and wild like that of the mane of a black lion, obscured much of her face, though through that darkened canopy I could see her eyes.

Access between the different floors and levels can consist of a simple ladder and hatch, a stairwell, or small teleportation circles that lead to the room of your choice. Each level takes one of the following forms, chosen by you when you cast the spell:",

Any equipment or furnishings conjured with the tower dissipate into smoke if removed from it. At the end of the spell's duration, all creatures and objects within the tower that were not created by the spell appear safely outside on the ground, and all traces of the tower and its furnishings disappear. Any equipment or objects that were taken into the tower can be left safely within the tower's rooms, and remain in the place they were left until the next casting of this spell.

All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. By means of this spell, the tower can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell, you can choose to have the tower become {@condition invisible} to creature you do not allow inside, it becomes {@condition invisible} and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by the divination of spells. You always know the exact location of the tower, and you can never be barred from entering your own tower.",

Examples include a specific password or phrase that must be said. You can change the password needed to see and enter the tower by spending 10 minutes in meditation within the tower.",

You can have only one of these spells remain permanent within the tower at a time, and they appear along with the tower when you cast this spell to summon the tower again. Each servant you create can move freely within the tower and the 20-foot radius surrounding the tower. For the unseen servant spell, you can choose to have it become seen and take a form of your choice. It's Intelligence becomes 10, and it can speak, read, and write each language that you know. It gains a simple personality, such as cheerful, gloomy, lethargic, energetic, or playful.",
				"You can cast this spell again while it is active to maintain the tower's existence for another 24 hours. You can create a permanent tower by casting this spell in the same location and with the same configuration every day for one year. When the tower becomes permanent, you can choose to keep the tower under the effects of being hidden away permanently, or can choose to have this feature become activated on your command."
