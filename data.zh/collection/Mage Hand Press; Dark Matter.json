										"果然，他们在没有任何拦截的情况下降落在其中一个冰冷的小行星上。\"你确定他们在这里吗？\"梅克特-努问道，而他还是以战斗的姿态准备好他的太阳杖。",
										"\"你看到上面漂浮着的垃圾了。有人在这里，如果他们不尊重星际垃圾法的话，我推断他们一定是顽固的罪犯。\"纳诺低声说，表情看不出来。",

										"同时，纳诺触发了一个小工具，在他们三人周围部署了一个大的半球形的力量。\"在这里，保存你的法术。我从船上给你拿了一把卡宾枪；在我准备好的时候，它应该足以拖住他们。\"",
										"\"设置了吗？\" 拉米想问，但又是一阵火光袭来，击碎了小精灵的临时穹顶。打到甲板上，她用咒语在冰上升起一道矮墙。\"炸掉它，梅克，下来！\"",
										"阿维亚拉的肌肉胸膛上已经烧出了几道焦痕，他一边叫着一边用太阳杖向攻击者射击，但很快就意识到拉米说得有道理。面对这么多的人，防卫措施是必要的。",
										"他们两人与走私者交火，将其中一些人击倒，但对减少他们的人数优势没有什么作用。没过多久，坚定的枪手们就进入了侧翼位置，他们中的一个领导人喊道。\"我不知道你是谁，但任何认为他们可以闯入我们的小行星并活着离开的人都不会很聪明！\"。我们也要拿下那艘船！\"",
										"就在这时，纳诺在一个类似炮台的装置上停止了工作。\"在你跳下去之前不要数你的蟑螂，肉包子！\" 然后，该装置开始发光。",

										"纳诺和Mekhet-Nu坐在寂静的桥上，似乎有很长一段时间了。他们互相看着对方，表情茫然。当冲击波袭来时，两人都开始伸手去拿他们的控制器；巨大的能量释放在现实的结构中产生了波浪。他们被从座位上推开，惊讶地发现自己漂浮在天花板上，人工重力暂时失效。",
										"Mekhet-Nu反应最快，在半空中打了个旋，把自己从天花板上弹了出去，回到了自己的岗位上。\"拉米！\" 他对着对讲机吼道。\"损坏报告！\"。生命支持系统似乎已经坏了！\"",
										"\"正在办，\"她回答。\"呃，这可能需要一些时间。尽量不要呼吸太多......\"",
										"\"能行！\" 纳诺鸣叫着，现在又回到了船长的位置上。下一条信息是发给加弗莱克特的：\"那么你喜欢这个吗，龙？我们还有很多东西要做！\"",
										"愤怒的嘶嘶声是唯一的回应，因为盗贼们看着加弗莱克特退到一颗小行星后面作掩护。",

										"当他们接近目标时，拉米出现在舰桥上，浑身肮脏，散发着臭氧的味道。\"我已经做了我能做的一切。制造机和奥术炮被烧毁了。生命支持系统也被破坏了，但我设法把空气过滤器安装起来，这样我们就不会窒息。至少，在一段时间内。另外，当我在下面的时候，我注意到电脑上的防病毒模块似乎过热了。你认为那是什么原因，纳诺？\"",
										"那名中尉愣了一下，然后跳下走廊去找工程部，在路上差点把拉米撞倒。\"你有桥，梅克！\"",
										"即使没有对讲机，也能听到纳诺痛苦的尖叫声。\"Mek，仔细检查传感器！我认为Garfreckt已经发现了-- 我想加弗莱克特已经发现了--\"",
										"\"你们这些傻瓜以为我会上这种低级的当！\" 这一次，加弗莱克特的声音通过飞船的内部通讯器传来。\"我建议你们准备好迎接冲击，\"他咆哮道，声音中掺杂着冷酷的怒气。",
										"拉米、纳诺和梅克特-努根本没有时间来执行这一命令，因为一只巨大的爪子在那一瞬间撞上了他们的飞船。整个飞船在撞击下发出呻吟；墙壁和地板随着上层建筑的扭曲和弯曲而弯曲。船员们被狠狠地抛来抛去，拉米因为极端的力量而昏迷。",
										"Mekhet-Nu是下一个倒下的人，当飞船撞上一颗小行星时，他被灼热的光线吞噬了。他最后看到的是纳诺，在摆弄另一个小工具。"

Wizmos are designed by the fey and therefore know a number of convoluted ways to slip between the planes and return to their master's side, appearing the instant their master thinks they are at last alone. If their master leaves the wizmos behind, even if their master is on another plane of existence, the wizmos will appear nearby their master after one minute, unless doing so would place them in grave danger.",

When such a command is given, roll a d20. On a roll of 14 or higher, the wizmos obey the command to the best of their ability. On a roll of 6 or lower, the wizmos fail to obey the command whatsoever, and instead do something totally unrelated to the command. On a roll of 7 to 13, the wizmos attempt to obey the command, but get confused and do something similar to the command.

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, temperatures, and cosmic signals appropriate to the thing being depicted. You can't, however, create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.<br>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of an asteroid, you can make it rotate on its axis. Similarly, you can cause the image to make different sounds at different times.<br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. The image does, however, fool sensor systems. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and the image's other sensory qualities become faint for that creature."

The donor creature need not be alive or even whole, as long as you target part of a creature that has died within the last 10 days.<br>The recipient creature gains any of the following traits from the target creature that you choose: the target's movement speed and types of movement, all of the target's damage resistances, the target's special senses, or one of the target's special traits, such as a ghast's Stench trait. If selected, the GM decides which special trait, if any, the recipient gains from the target creature. The recipient doesn't gain any traits from the creature that do not result from its race or monster statistics.<br>The recipient's appearance changes to resemble a hybrid of the target creature and itself. These changes, as well as the traits gained by the recipient creature, last for the duration."

In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.",

Utilitarian to the point of volatility, vect ships abandon all systems and features not strictly related to their operation, forgoing even life-support; after all, vect don't need to breathe, and the exposed arcane engines powering their ships provide just enough heat to keep the pilot from freezing to death. Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.",

Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger."
