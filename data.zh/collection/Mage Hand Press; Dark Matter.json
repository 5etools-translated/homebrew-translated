										"The feathered monk obliged, lowering himself into a seat surrounded by shimmering scrying mirrors, with control yokes built into each arm. As he did so, the whole ship seemed to awaken with magical energy, Rami having found her way to the engine room.",
										"\"Fasten your seatbelts, everyone,\" Nano announced, firing up the impulse thrusters, \"we don't exactly have clearance to take off, so this might be a little bumpy...\"",
										"And indeed it was, but once their Freelancer was clear of the station, they were away quickly, launching into a void jump moments after passing through the hangar doors. A blind jump, yes, but one Nano was familiar with. Besides, the Miaam-Osk Pathway had long been a favorite route for both smugglers and legitimate merchants, so even if the jump wasn't entirely accurate, there would be enough beacons, signals and landmark planetoids to get back on track.",
										"As the ship progressed through the void, Rami popped back to the bridge. \"If them Firm boys are anywhere, they'll be in the Whiteglass cluster at the far edge of the Miaam system. The asteroids there block all divination magic somehow. It's a good place to hide...\"",
										"\"...but it also means they won't be able to see us coming.\" Mekhet-Nu finished the thought.",
										"\"Excellent. Let's go steal us an arcane warhead.\"",
										"Sure enough, they touched down on one of the icy asteroids without any kind of interception. \"Are you sure they're here?\" asked Mekhet-Nu, while he nonetheless readied his sunstaff in a battle stance.",
										"\"You saw the junk drifting around up there. Someone's here, and if their lack of respect for interplanetary littering laws is anything to go by, I deduce they must be hardened criminals,\" whispered Nano, expression unreadable.",
										"\"Did\u2014did the vect just tell a joke?\" Rami gawked.",
										"Her bewilderment was interrupted by a flurry of blaster fire, which began to scythe through the party from an unseen pillbox, half buried in snow.",
										"\"Damn it!\" Rami cursed, ducking and rolling to one side. Seeing Firm goons appearing out of their holes, she hurled a fireball, scorching the nearest group.",
										"Meanwhile, Nano triggered a gadget, deploying a large hemisphere of force around the three of them. \"Here, save your spells. I grabbed a carbine for you from the ship; it should be enough to hold them off while I get set up.\"",
										"\"Set up?\" Rami tried to ask, but another hail of fire came in, shattering the gadgeteer's temporary dome. Hitting the deck, she used a cantrip to raise a low wall out of ice. \"Blast it, Mek, get down!\"",
										"The avia-ra, several scorch marks already burned into his muscular chest, squawked as he fired his sunstaff into the attackers, but soon realized that Rami had a point. Against so many, defensive measures would be necessary.",
										"The two of them exchanged shots with the smugglers, pinning some of them down, but doing little to reduce their numerical advantage. Before long, Firm gunmen were moving into flanking positions, and one of their leaders shouted: \"I don't know who you are, but anyone who thinks they can barge onto our asteroid and get away alive can't be very smart! We'll be taking that ship, too!\"",
										"Just then, Nano stopped working on a turret-like device. \"Don't count your roaches before you've jumped, fleshbag!\" The device then began to glow.",
										"\"Is that... should we...?\" Rami stammered.",
										"\"Yes, we should probably get out of the way. The targeting matrix in this is kind of... improvised.\"",
										"The three of them scrambled away, just in time to see Nano's hastily-constructed turret let loose a beam of crackling energy, which then proceeded to sweep through the ranks of assailants, jerking up and down to eliminate targets both near and far.",
										"When the screeching turret at last quieted, Nano was the first to speak. \"Well, they aren't storing the warhead on the surface at least. Thankfully for us. Come on, it must be somewhere inside.\"\""

										"In between the maw jumps, blind jumps, narrow escapes from the authorities, and broadsides delivered into an unfortunate spaceshark, the three thieves had ample time to plan their raid on Garfreckt's hoard. All that remained was to plant the distraction, sneak into the treasure cave, and make a clean getaway.",
										"It did not take long at all for things to go awry. Mere seconds after their arrival in Garfreckt's asteroid field, the dragon appeared on the sensor screens, an ominous rendering of wings and horns perched atop an asteroid, and a fearsome growl filled the vacuum of space. \"You fools think to rob me? Ha! Preposterous! I am Garfreckt, the Eternal Dragon!! And I can smell your humanoid stink from light years away.\"",
										"Rami let out a long stream of curses before Nano opened a telepathic channel on the ship's communicator. \"Let's not be hasty here, 'o mighty dragon. We come bearing gifts... Hey Mek, arm one of the arcane warheads.\"",
										"The avia-ra took a second to understand the intent behind Nano's improvisation. \"No longer a distraction, then, but a bluff?\" He asked once the channel had closed. \"It won't work. Look, he's drawing closer.\"",
										"\"Let's show him we mean business. Even an eternal dragon's got to think twice after taking a hit from one of these.\"",
										"Mekhet-Nu composed himself. \"To fire such a weapon... it is a weighty thing, even if there's no one nearby to be caught in the blast. At least allow me a moment to reflect.\" The monk paused for several seconds, exhaled, then pressed the button.",
										"Nano and Mekhet-Nu sat on a silent bridge for what seemed like an eternity. They looked at each other, expressions blank. Both were starting to reach for their controls when the shockwave hit; the massive discharge of energy making waves in the very fabric of reality. Hurled from their seats, they were surprised to find themselves floating up to the ceiling, the artificial gravity temporarily disabled.",
										"Mekhet-Nu reacted fastest, whirling around in mid-air and catapulting himself off the ceiling and back to his station. \"Rami!\" He barked into the intercom. \"Damage report! The life support seems to be down!\"",
										"\"On it,\" she replied. \"Uh, this might take a while. Try not to breathe too much...\"",
										"\"Can do!\" Nano chirped, now back in the captain's chair. The next message went out to Garfreckt: \"So how do you like that, dragon? We've got plenty more where that came from!\"",
										"A furious hissing was the only response, as the thieves watched Garfreckt retreat behind an asteroid for cover.",
										"For the next few minutes, the pair on the bridge said nothing, carefully piloting the ship towards the dragon's hoard, hoping both that their deception would hold and Rami would be able to repair the damaged systems with equal fervor.",
										"As they closed on their goal, Rami appeared on the bridge, filthy and reeking of ozone. \"I've done all I can. Fabricator and arcane cannon are fried. Life support is busted too, but I've managed to rig the air filter up so we won't suffocate. At least, for a while. Also, while I was down there, I noticed that the antivirus module on the computer seems to be overheating... What do you reckon that's all about, Nano?\"",
										"The vect froze for a second, then leapt down the corridor to engineering, nearly bowling Rami over on the way through. \"You have the bridge, Mek!\"",
										"Nano's anguished scream could be heard even without the intercom. \"Mek, double-check the sensors! I think Garfreckt's figured out\u2014\"",
										"\"\u2014THAT YOU FOOLS THINK I WOULD FALL FOR SUCH A CHEAP TRICK!\" This time, Garfreckt's voice was transmitted over the ship's internal comms. \"I suggest you brace for impact,\" he growled, voice dripping with cold fury.",
										"Rami, Nano, and Mekhet-Nu were given no time at all to enact that order, as a massive claw crashed into their ship that very instant. The whole craft groaned under the impact; walls and floors bending and flexing as the superstructure twisted and buckled. The crew were tossed around viciously, with Rami blacking out due to the extreme forces.",
										"Mekhet-Nu was the next to fall, engulfed in searing light as the ship crashed into an asteroid. The last thing he saw was Nano, fiddling with yet another gadget."

										"A wild cheer went up in the cantina. \"A round for my adoring fans!\" Rami waved her datapad, full of credits, in the direction of the bartender.",
										"\"So Garfreckt tried to space you? How did you escape?\" someone asked.",
										"\"Look, I don't want to say I outsmarted an eternal dragon...\" she paused. \"But he should have known I'd have a few scrolls handy. A terrific transport was perfect to get everyone together and out of the vacuum.\"",
										"\"Okay, but how did you get away from the asteroid?\" Came the immediate response. \"Your shuttle wouldn't have lasted six seconds against the dragon.\"",
										"\"You can thank him for that,\" she pointed at Mekhet-Nu, seated at the other end of the bar. \"Turns out he'd got in touch with some of his disciples ahead of time. They had a ship waiting for us right when we needed it.\"",
										"The crowd went quiet for a while. In a low voice, someone remarked: \"strange choice for a partner in crime.\"",
										"\"Hey, don't you be sneering at Mek. He's alright, for an avia-ra.\" She waved at him across the bar.",

										"Mekhet-Nu dived out of the way as the Blaster Prototype unleashed another unstable wave of energy.",
										"\"I did not expect such petulant behavior!\" The weapon, of course, said nothing. It was in one of its sulky moods today. Mekhet-Nu adopted a parental tone.",
										"\"Young miss, are you not the legendary Prototype, first of all blasters?\" The weapon's arcane engine revved, emitting bright blue exhaust from two ports like piercing eyes.",
										"\"Do you not possess terrific power?\" Again, the weapon unleashed a wild torrent of fire, this time scorching a training dummy to ash.",
										"\"Then why won't you yield?\" said the avia-ra, aggravation cracking his usual stony demeanor. Defiant, the blaster belched forth a wave of exhaust gas.",
										"Mekhet-Nu took a deep breath to center himself. The Blaster Prototype was not only alive, but downright tempestuous. Yet he had patience in droves. More importantly, he had no other options. When the High Priests of the Sun came for him, he and the Prototype would have to be ready.",
										"‒ ‒ ‒",
										"\"Almost... there...\" Nano groaned, leveraging the wrenchinator with all possible weight. As the bolt gave way, the entire chassis clunked into place and circuits sprung to life. Dragon's fire rushed outward from the breastplate, ejecting spouts of flame at every bolt and joint. As the flames reached the golem's extremities, its hands clenched and its head turned to see its creator.",
										"Nano was surprised that the trinket stolen from the dragon's hoard even fit, but dumbfounded to see it working. After all, the inside of the golem was now more vent tape than circuitry.",
										"\"Welcome to the 'verse, Mac!\" Nano knocked once on the golem's chest to hear the satisfying clunk. This was the gadget to end all gadgets! Should probably build some legs for it, though.",
										"‒ ‒ ‒",
										"Garfreckt, the eternal dragon, touched down on Sepa-Atef, blasting a massive cloud of sand out into the desert. In the distance, he could see mountains, some of them towering to two or three times his own height.",
										"The avia-ra delegation came buzzing over the jagged horizon in their Herald and Pilgrim class ships, golden livery glinting in the light from this planet's twin stars.",
										"Garfreckt signaled his lieutenants to welcome the High Priests of the Sun. \"Greetings, your eminences. The eternal dragon is greatly pleased to meet you face-to-face.\"",
										"\"The pleasure is all ours,\" gushed the priests' interpreter, bowing deeply, \"and we are most eager to do business with such a great and esteemed partner. Especially considering the... intelligence that you have recently acquired.\"",
										"As the priests took their thrones, a Scale & Fang wizard conjured an illusory image of Mekhet-Nu. \"We understand that you are seeking this man. What would you give to know where he is hiding, I wonder...?\""

Moreover, the two worlds are fully disparate, for where one might have a temple and a shaded forest, the other has a lake of lava and a craggy mountain. Only visitors to this world seem to notice the shift. Unattended objects, including those brought by visitors, and the planet's residents (monstrous and otherwise) simply vanish when the shift occurs, and reappear when their world returns."

You decide what action the construct will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the construct only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the construct continues to follow it until its task is complete.<br>No magic can restore the construct's hit points, as hardlight always evaporates away with time."

				"You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 1,000-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, temperatures, and cosmic signals appropriate to the thing being depicted. You can't, however, create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.<br>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of an asteroid, you can make it rotate on its axis. Similarly, you can cause the image to make different sounds at different times.<br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. The image does, however, fool sensor systems. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and the image's other sensory qualities become faint for that creature."

In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.",

Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.",

Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps.
