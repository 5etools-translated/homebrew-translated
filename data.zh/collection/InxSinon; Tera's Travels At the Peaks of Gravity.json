								"The ancestors of the thrush, known commonly as birdfolk, have various origins across different worlds. In some, they came from the Elemental Plane of Air, in others they were born of more natural ways. Regardless of their origin, divides among the ancient birdfolk gave birth to both the thrush and aarakocra species, each having their own unique characteristics and cultures. This divide is due to mainly thrush living for generations in their own mountaintop societies isolated from other humanoids."

Living in this harsh environment for generations with only open air around the peaks has altered thrush to have no need for long distance flying, only short bursts to get from peak to peak and glide through the mountainous terrain. Their arms and wings are not separate appendages, but one in the same, with clawed hands at the end."
