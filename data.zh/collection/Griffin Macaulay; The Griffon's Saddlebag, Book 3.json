A page can hold up to 5 objects on it whose total value is no more than 25 gp, such as an array of trinkets, trophies, or other mundane keepsakes. Alternatively, an object worth more than 25 gp, such as a satchel of coins or magical item, must be stored on its own page.",

Once all the book's pages have been torn from the tome, it loses its magic. Attempting to store a tome of the dragon's hoard on the page of another tome of the dragon's hoard causes both books' pages to tear themselves out of the books, destroying them, and sending any stored items contained by them toppling out of the pages around you. Similarly, storing a {@item bag of holding} or similar extradimensional item in the book causes the page it's placed in to immediately tear itself out of the book and spew the item onto the floor beside you again, wasting the page."

				"This handheld metal device weighs 8 pounds and measures about 2 feet long and 6 inches across at its widest point. Parts of it resemble a crossbow, such as its stock and trigger, but is otherwise unique in its design. It has a pair of gaps in its wooden stock which can hold two flasks of alchemist's fire, fitting the flasks' mouths into a hole in the bottom of the space. Upending a flask into one of the gaps in this way allows its contents to run through a hidden pipeline within the stock and into the rest of the machine, causing a glass-covered chamber on the top of the device to fill with bubbling liquid. When filled in this way, the two vertical slots at the front of the machine give off a warm and foreboding glow.",

You can use an action to load a new flask into the stock, discarding the previous one as part of the same action. While a flask of alchemist's fire is typically thrown, this device converts and concentrates a tiny portion of the sticky solution into a superheated discus that flies from the weapon instead, allowing the normally single-use flasks to power the machine for many attacks instead.",
				"The device loses 1 charge each time you use it to make a ranged weapon attack, which has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet. On a hit, a target takes fire damage equal to {@dice 1d6} plus your Dexterity modifier. For each attack that hits, the target also takes {@damage 1d6} fire damage at the end of its next turn as the alchemist's fire smolders and evaporates from its body.",
				"Alternatively, while holding the machine, you can use an action to expend 10 of its charges to magically release a belching stream of concentrated alchemist's fire from it in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 8d6} fire damage. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."

To do so, it crumples and folds itself to form a makeshift face while it speaks.

If the ooze takes fire damage from a spell or other effect, such as a fireball blast, it remains unharmed but nevertheless lights the fuse. The lit fuse burns down into the center of the ooze after {@dice 1d4} rounds. When it reaches the center, the ooze explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within 10 feet of the ooze must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 4d6} fire damage and is pushed 5 feet away from the ooze on a failed save. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much fire damage and isn't pushed. If the ooze was placed on an object that was being neither worn nor carried, that object takes the maximum amount of damage from the explosion. If the object is a door, it's forced open as part of the explosion, provided that the door could have also been opened with a successful DC 25 Strength check or lower.",
				"If you use an action to carefully ignite the fuse, you can choose the number of rounds it takes for the fuse to burn (up to 4), instead of rolling a {@dice d4}. If the fuse is lit another way, the GM rolls the {@dice d4} in secret. A lit fuse can be extinguished by a creature within reach as normal or if it's doused with water."

If there isn't space for the tower, you don't transform, and the action (but not the use of this property) is wasted. Your equipment merges into this form when you transform and has no effect for the duration. For the duration, you use your normal senses, but your speed is reduced to 0.

While in this form, you can't cast spells, and your normal attacks are replaced by unarmed strikes using your massive stone fists. These unarmed strikes have a reach of 30 feet and deal {@damage 4d8} bludgeoning damage on a hit. You can make two unarmed strike attacks on each of your turns when you take the {@action Attack} action, even if you can normally make more. Alternatively, you can use an action to hurl a boulder from your arm. The boulder is a ranged weapon attack with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. On a hit, it deals {@damage 6d8} bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with these attacks, which use your Strength modifier for their attack and damage rolls.",

A door large enough for Medium creatures to enter the tower appears on the ground. Creatures of your choice can open the door easily, but any other creature must make a DC 20 Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB} or a DC 25 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to open it. The tower has no windows, but has two floors and a staircase connecting them inside.",
