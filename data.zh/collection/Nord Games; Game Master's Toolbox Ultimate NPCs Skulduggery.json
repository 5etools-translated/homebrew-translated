						"像许多游戏玩家一样，我们从很小的时候起就充满了创造力。创意写作、诗歌、艺术和音乐一直在我们的生活中扮演着重要角色，但在我们十几岁的时候，当我们坐下来玩第一场龙与地下城时，所有这些天赋和激情都被点燃，变成了一场兴奋的风暴。虽然我们当时并不知道，但这第一场游戏将是一次改变人生的经历。近二十年来，我们一直在创造角色，进行奇妙的冒险，每一次都比上一次更令人激动！\"。",
						"当最新版本的D&D上架时，我们急切地想尝试一下。我们参加了测试过程，看到许多新的和有趣的规则进入了现场。我们很喜欢入门套装，每本核心规则书一上市，我们就拿了出来。一年来，我们每周，有时是每天，都会举行游戏会议，我们探索危险的地下城，面对不可逾越的大军，与致命的敌人战斗，并征服了可怕的野兽。一路走来，我们失去了一些党员，但他们的名字会被记住，因为我们会在未来的日子里回忆起我们一起经历的史诗般的冒险。",
						"这个话题引起了我们所有人的思考。我们如何才能帮助游戏社区，包括游戏管理员和玩家，从他们的游戏体验中获得最大的收益？这个问题并不容易回答。外面已经有这么多优秀的内容，玩家真正需要的是什么，而不是已经存在的？",
						"一天晚上，在一次游戏过程中，我们的游戏主人有点不按剧本办事，需要一个计划外的NPC与玩家互动，答案很自然地出现了。他花了比平时更多的时间来创造这个NPC，经过几次滚动，他有了足够的东西，但没有更多。没有背景故事，除了基于种族和性别的刻板印象之外，没有真正的个性。",
						"我们立刻看到了对一本还不存在的资源书的需求：一本由NPC组成的书，这些NPC不仅仅有名字、种族和等级。一本可以由游戏管理员用来填充酒馆、贸易站或宴会厅的书。另外，玩家也可以用这本书来创建起始角色，或者窥探角色的进展，或者在冒险过程中，如果他们来晚了，而其他玩家的角色已经升了几级，就可以创建后期的角色。",
						"我们集思广益，通力合作，看到我们的追求在我们面前展开。这不是一项容易的任务，但没有什么值得做的事是容易的。我们都知道；我们多年的角色扮演游戏已经一次又一次地证明了这一点。你不能只是漫步而来，屠龙而去，它需要计划、准备、才能和团队合作来完成最艰难的任务。所以这就是我们所做的。"

								"塔坦通过他与小偷和罪犯的地下网络的联系，寻求 \"鹅毛笔\"（第68页）的帮助，这是一个口风很紧的伪造者行会，只要请求者愿意付出代价，他们就能巧妙地制作出任何需要的文件...... 就在国王要对汉蒙德的财产提出要求的前两天，一份遗嘱在他最私人的文件中被意外发现，宣布塔坦和其他四名红手套成员是他巨大财产的受益人。这些财富被平均分配给这五人，而且，如此巨大的补偿只是他财富的一部分，其他四人对塔坦似乎已经得到了汉蒙德的全部土地而感到不满。塔坦很快被任命为领主，并在汉蒙德曾居住的领主之家居住。",

Many days passed as word reached his sons of his death. They rode many days and many nights to the high dune and, once there, gathered what they could of their father's ashes. Th ey swore revenge on all kingdoms in the realm and took the ashes, gathering them in a copper urn. Vabrum, Vasim's eldest son, commissioned the smithing of a new sword which he would use to remove the head of every king who had conspired against his father. He instructed the smith to mix his father's ashes into the coal he would use to smelt the ore, thereby imbuing the blade with the very soul of Vasim himself. Th e blade remained an heirloom of the Tell'ani brothers and their decedents until well aft er it had fulfi lled Vabrum's curse on the kings. Aft er that, the blade mysteriously went missing, but has been claimed to exist mounted on the wall of countless armories throughout the realms."

Aelar, having a vested interest in the matter, tracked the thieves who had fl ed with the stolen merchandise through a small forest and to a nearby river.

					"Thief Slayer It had been nearly two months of hard work: freezing nights on rooft ops and up to his knees in fi lth in the sewers, but it had all been worth it. Th e information he had gathered\u2014watch schedules, rivalries, fears\u2014meant his plan went off  without a hitch. Aft er tonight, Th e Vipers would never take out another bounty on him. Last night was hard, but by sunrise twelve of the highest ranking members of the group lay dead. Aelar had used their own techniques against them, making it look like old rivalries had fl ared, or treacherous deals had been made. Come the morning the bodies were discovered, and the entire gang dissolved into infi ghting factions. Th ose that weren't killed were now in chains and would doubtless face the hangman. Now there were just a few loose ends to clear up. Th ree loose ends to be precise, limping their way through the woods a few miles out from the city: the chief and his last two remaining loyal men.",
					"Aelar had been close on their trail throughout the evening and, now that they had stopped to make camp, he had his opportunity. Th e chief had taken the fi rst watch, staring slumped into the campfi re. Aelar nocked an arrow and drew back the string but, just as he leveled his aim, the chief's face hardened with a sudden resolve. Slowly, he got to his feet, a fl ash of fi re at his belt as his knife left  its sheath. Aelar held his breath, but he was seemingly not the chief's target. Instead, he moved towards his sleeping men, clearly meaning to put to rest any suspicion in his mind that they would turn on him as the others had.",
					"Aelar loosed the arrow; the chief grunted as it pierced his chest, and he sank to his knees. Th e two men awoke, startled, and reached for their weapons but two arrows piercing their wrists put a stop to such thoughts. Th e chief toppled forwards snapping a smoldering log and sending embers fl ying, and the men surrendered.",
					"Aelar left  them tied to a tree by the city's main gate, and ordered them to call for help, \"and when it comes,\" he told them, \"you shall confess your crimes and lead the guard to your camp.",
					"As he disappeared into the night, he had a sudden thought.  \"And tell them Th e Th ief Slayer sent you.\" ",

					"Overview ",
					"Cogrin's father taught him the art of swordplay from an early age, imparting all of his own knowledge to his son. On his sixteenth birthday, he was given a masterfully craft ed greatsword which his father had spent weeks forging, balancing, sharpening, and polishing. It was a thing to behold, and he was grateful. Cogrin's people were natural warriors, but only ever meant to defend what was theirs; their land and their families.",
					"The village lived in relative peace for many years until one day, when Cogrin and his uncle were hunting in the forest for deer and small game, they spied a troop of half a dozen vagabonds, scurrying through the forest with a common purpose: a scouting party, his uncle thought. Th ey were headed toward Cogrin's village, each of them heavily armed and ready for battle.",
					"Cogrin and his uncle intercepted the group and slew every one of them, by bow and by sword. It was the first time his blade had tasted human blood. When they returned to their village they found it ablaze. Their families were either slain or taken, along with anything valuable. Cogrin found his father's body near his forge, pierced with many arrows and laying in a circle of slain foes. His sword was missing, as was Cogrin's mother. ",
					"Personality Traits ",
					"\"Talk is cheap.\" Cogrin judges people by their actions, not their words. He has little patience for folk who speak too much, or refuse to pay other folk proper respect. He does not hide his emotions, expressing his thoughts and feelings without care for who he might off end. ",
					"Ideals ",
					"\"We are all born free.\" He values freedom above all other things in life. Tyrants must not be allowed to oppress people, he will gladly be part of any plan that involves disrupting their schemes. ",
					"Bonds ",
					"\"I will find her. One day.\" He is constantly on the move, searching for any sign of his mother and the villains who took her. He has a deeply ingrained desire to protect those who cannot protect themselves.",
					"Flaws",
					"\"I'll tell you when I've had enough!\" He has a weakness for vices of the city, especially hard drink and easy women. He's been the instigator in more than a few tavern brawls. He uses his great size to intimidate people more oft en than he should, and oft en regrets his actions in retrospect.",
					"Roleplaying Cogrin",
					"Cogrin has two very diff erent personalities. Around men, he is gruff  and quick to accept, or issue, a challenge. He will speak his mind, even going so far as to put another man's reputation and honor into question publicly. Around women, he is respectful and chivalrous. A gentle hulk, whose reputation among the fairer sex may actually be more wide spread than it is among men who either fear or admire him.",
					"He is not above stealing what he needs to survive and rarely has any money to pay for goods and services. He has been known to sneak into a hayloft  for a good night's rest if he can't fi nd a free room in the local inn.",
					"In combat, Cogrin will not back down to insurmountable odds, believing that he will be victorious over evil no matter what. He prefers to meet his enemies head on, but his experience in battle prevents him from passing up an attack of opportunity.",

					"Ka'Laera lives to exert power over those weaker than herself and revels in the destruction and humiliation of any who have wronged her. She sees any attack on her employer's interests as a personal slight, and any long term plans are put on hold to systematically and brutally tear apart the lives of those responsible.  ",
					"Ka'Laera's primary weapon is fear; she spreads rumors amongst her various personas, letting it be known that she is in the city, and could be anywhere. Overtime, this creates an environment of paranoia, where no one truly trusts anyone, and no coordinated response can be formulated for the schemes of her employer. ",

She'd rather die than let another have power over her, but if she senses weakness, compassion or is off ered a bribe, she will readily give up false information (as disastrously wrong as possible) and escape at the first opportunity. Those who cross her or her employer will be attacked in the most personally damaging way possible; Ka'Laera has no sense of honor, and no compunctions about threatening or harming innocents if it will help her get to her target.

					"Once a hunter and trapper selling furs and game, Mal began his criminal career by accident\u2014he was falsely accused of murder shortly after entering a foreign city. While awaiting his turn at the gallows, he shared a jail cell with two members of a local thieves guild. Although they spoke the common tongue to him, they spoke to one another in a strange language. The night before they were to be executed, Mal was suddenly roused from sleep. His cell mates were conspiring. When they noticed he was awake they motioned for him to stay silent. They spoke in whispers, \"How much do you want to live?\" ",
					"Mal became suddenly frightened, thinking these thieves meant to slit his throat. He was, however, mistaken. Th ey explained that their guild brothers would be unlocking their cell shortly, and, if he so desired, he could go free as well. He was skeptical but desperate. Sure enough, minutes later, the light from a guard's oil lamp came through the small barred window in the cell door. A hushed voice echoed in the chamber just outside and one of the thieves in Mal's cell answered. Th e key in the lock chattered. It was now or never and Mal's cell mates didn't waste time.",
					"On the floor just outside his cell door there sat an oil lamp and a key ring. Mal knelt down to take them, but when he looked up again, the thieves were gone. He was on his own. ",
					"He crept slowly, but not very quietly, through the network of hallways and passages for several tense minutes, trying to recall the exact route that he was brought days earlier. It was hard to remember as he had been badly beaten by the city guard during his arrest, then again as he was brought to the prison and questioned. He thought about slitting the throats of every guard he might meet but, surprisingly, there were none on patrol. The thieves and their guild mates' work, he thought. ",
					"Suddenly he rounded a corner, and there was the flickering of fi relight. He crept closer as quietly as he could, discovering one of many guard rooms. In it were several guards lying in bunks, or sitting around a fire in the middle of the room, but there was no sound besides the crackling of the dwindling fire. Mal approached cautiously to find that all of the guards had been slain with a single slice to the throat. ",
					"He quickly ransacked the room, taking any coin he could lay his hands on, along with arms and armor. He left the oil lamp but kept the keys, exiting the large door to the north. Finding himself in the moonlight of the early morning, he took a deep breath of free air. Having been spat on by the world for attempting an honest living, Mal turned his back on his old life and vowed to bring down the system of \"justice\" which allowed him to be jailed.",
					"Personality Traits ",

Th e arthritic dog of a neighbor mysteriously disappeared one day and was found cut into neat pieces in the temple grounds next to Nimh's house. She had just wanted to know why it was broken and if it could be fi xed. Th e fi nal straw came as a teenager, when she ‘fi xed' the pneumonia of the farmer's prize sheep by transplanting into it the lungs of his carthorse. Th e townsfolk hid their children and animals as she made her way to the road. ",
					"She moved to a town where nobody knew of her peculiarities and trained as an apothecary, keeping her unusual ‘hobbies' to herself. Her intensive study turned her into an accomplished alchemist; observing the eff ects of elixirs on living things mesmerized her. Not satisfi ed with simply viewing their external eff ects, waifs and strays both human and animal oft en found themselves invited in out of the cold, then strapped to a table in her tiny backroom, fl esh and muscle neatly clipped back to reveal their inner workings. If they were lucky, Nimh would let them die fi rst.",
					"Completely ruthless and clinical, she had no reservations whatsoever when mortal representatives of the Demon Lord of the Affl  icted appeared to her and off ered her knowledge beyond measure in exchange for what's left  of those who perish on her table. To increase her body count, she now moonlights as a backstreet surgeon, mostly for the less savory characters of the town, and can easily be persuaded to facilitate a ‘tragic complication' if her patron would prefer the patient not make a full recovery. Aft er all, the necromancers get what they want and Nimh can start a new ‘side-project'... ",
					"Personality Traits ",
					"\"Emotions cloud the mind. Logic fuels it.\" Nimh doesn't hate those she kills, nor does she love what she does. Nimh approaches her work with cold, mechanical necessity. ",
					"Ideals ",
					"\"Life is learning. Everything has a lesson for those willing to see it.\" Nimh isn't a sadist. She does what she does out of  genuine inquisitiveness and a longing to learn more about the world. ",
					"Bonds ",
					"\"So many people stumble through life with no purpose. My subjects are lucky; they get to do something of use as they die.\" The high body count is a side-effect, not the aim. If Nimh's research could be facilitated by just the one death then it would be so, for efficiency's sake. ",
					"Flaws ",
					"\"People get in the way of my research. I'm better off  without them.\" Nimh's only tie is to her work. She recognizes that her methods are unusual and, even if it weren't, having assistants would only mean having to say her thoughts out loud, slowing the whole process down. ",
					"Roleplaying Nimh ",
					"Nimh is driven solely by the pursuit of knowledge and has no sentiment, no empathy and no moral compass; animals and humans are meat. Although not a natural combatant, she would not hesitate to kill to protect or further her research. However, while worth killing for, her research is not worth dying for. Naturally charismatic when it suits her, such as when persuading lowlifes in off  the street, she is generally solitary and quiet, believing interaction with others to be unnecessary, time-consuming and beneath her.

					"Overview",
					"Stanus once had aspirations of being a famous musician, traveling from town to town, making people smile and laugh. It didn't take long for the cruel reality of life to take advantage of a young and naive Stanus. Discovering that bards just starting out are not unquestioningly invited to play at court to those of quality, he resorted to playing for coppers in disgusting taverns and outside inns. He didn't even make enough to rent a room, and oft en slept in dirty allyways and under eaves. Despite his poor lodgings, he maintained his dignity with fi ne clothes and a fantastic hat. ",
					"Late one night, he was playing his lute outside of a tavern in the dim lamp light. His hat, with a handful of coppers and a few silvers, was upturned on a stool in front of him. Unbeknownst to him, he had attracted the attention of a few ruffi  ans who falsely assumed that such a well-dressed fellow would have more than a his fair share of coins and other valuables. They waited until the streets were fairly clear before making their move. ",
					"One of the three ruffi  ans approached casually, bobbing his head to the music before dropping a copper into the hat. Stanus bowed his head to him as he continued to play. That's when the other two ruffians snuck up from either side. He was grabbed and pushed up against the tavern wall. One ruffian quickly grabbed the hat and ran. The other two began to turn out his pockets. He struggled until a swift  punch to the stomach doubled him over. One of them ripped the lute from his hands, breaking the shoulder strap. The other one found his coin purse, \"Where is the rest?!\" He demanded. Another punch to the stomach. ",
					"At that moment, a tall figure opened the tavern door and staggered out. He looked over at the three of them and said, \"Let him go.\" The ruffians chuckled. The figure stepped closer, Stanus looked up to see a dapper sailor with tanned skin and long dark hair. \"He may not be the best musician, but what he lacks in talent he makes up for in determination.\" ",
					"The ruffian who had taken the lute approached, intending to use it as a club. Without a second thought, the man drew a pistol concealed under his jacket and fi red, killing him. The other thief began to run, so the man drew another pistol, took aim, and fired. He fell with a grunt. The stranger looked down at Stanus, \"Care to join me for an ale?\" ",
					"Stanus was shocked and surprised. He had no idea who he had just met, or how this man would change his life, and his views, forever. ",
					"Personality Traits ",
					"\"I'll be there.\" His friends know he's reliable and can count on him no matter what. He doesn't talk much, but when he does, most people listen. ",
					"Ideals ",
					"\"Enough wealth can set any man free.\" Gold and platinum are the key to a better life. He means to one day buy or steal a ship and chart his own destiny. ",

					"Flaws ",
