										"虽然他们的神已经离开了他们，但沃尔卡尼人在没有神的情况下继续生活，将他们为神的目的工作的动力转化为改善自己的愿望。虽然几个世纪以来，他们的身体外表已经变得成熟，但他们的决心却不能这么说。所有火山人都相信他们出生是有原因的，他们一直在寻找他们认为必须实现的目的。当一个火山人找到他们的目的时，他们要么完成它，要么死而后已。对于一个火山人来说，没有拖延或放弃这回事。"

										"火山人的灵魂就像一团闪烁的火焰--明亮而充满生机，直到它被扼杀的那一刻。比起任何其他种族，火山人的寿命是不确定的。成年后，火山人不再显示出衰老的迹象，并可能在此后的任何时间自然死亡。有些人可能早在20岁就死了，而其他人可能活到80岁。火山人相信，他们的寿命与他们与生俱来的目的有关--当他们完成这一目的时，死亡肯定就在不远处。",
										"但是对火山来说，死亡并不是真正的结束。死亡只是预示着下一代的开始。当火山人死亡时，他们的身体会燃烧成灰烬，雄性的颜色为深黑色，雌性的颜色为鲜艳的红色。火山人的孩子正是从这些灰烬中诞生的。通过提取成年男性火山人的一些灰烬，与成年女性火山人的一些灰烬相结合，并使用新鲜的熔岩来点燃这种混合物，在火焰消退后，一个新的火山人就诞生了。一对两个火山人有足够的火山灰来孕育四个孩子，但大多数夫妇只孕育两个或三个。火山人的记忆部分地传给了他们的孩子，他们经常在生动的梦中看到他们父母的记忆。这些记忆也可以使火山人在他们父母所知道的技能方面有一种自然的能力。",
										"火山人独特的生殖系统，加上他们不确定的寿命，使得火山人通常在生命的早期就为自己的死亡做计划。对于年轻的成年火山人来说，写下他们的第一份遗嘱几乎被认为是一种成年仪式。火山人的遗嘱通常指定如何处理他们的物质财产，就像其他种族的遗嘱一样，但更重要的是它指定了应该如何处理他们的骨灰。已婚的伏尔加尼人通常会订立联合遗嘱，说明他们未来孩子的潜在名字，以及他们希望有多少个孩子。未婚的伏尔加尼人要把他们的骨灰捐给他们的社区，这样他们就可以用于收养。火山人文化的另一个奇特之处在于创造个人骨灰盒，火山人要么委托他人，要么自己锻造。这些骨灰盒上装饰着大量的符号，讲述着为其制作的火山人的生活故事，并在火山人死后用来盛放和运送其灰烬。"

Their skin color ranges from a deep black to a lighter red, but the most common shades are lighter browns and greys, occasionally accented by streaks of red.
