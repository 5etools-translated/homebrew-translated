										"纹身师的工具还包括大量针头和用于消毒的医疗用品。如果纹身师的工具也被用来进行世俗的纹身，这是必要的。对于非魔法纹身的应用，凿子的针头可以蘸上适当的颜料，然后在个人的皮肤、鳞片或羽毛上敲打，以涂上纹身。"

										"对于不寻常的皮肤类型，纹身往往会以不同的形式出现。例如，被皮毛或羽毛覆盖的生物可能会看到纹身在离开针头时以标记的形式出现。具有金属外观的生物可能会看到纹身在它们的外壳上刻下自己。由于纹身只是另一种形式的魔法物品，这可以被解释为调和过程。",

Though appreciative of the entertainment provided in their streets and taverns at first, the townsfolk soon grew disinterested in Quid's tales. In response, Quid began to focus on a younger audience, knowing that children would bring their parents, and the parents, their purses. Unfortunately, the demands of entertaining children who constantly asked to hear the same songs and stories repeated ad nauseum was a wearying task. The magical properties of this tattoo allowed the bard to have his music repeated with no effort on his part, aside from passing around the collection plate."

Though a howl came at the end of the shot, the hunter found nothing when she went to investigate, save for a patch of dark blood upon the grass. Having no ammunition left, the hunter returned home and slept. She was awoken in the middle of the night by a loud scraping at the door. Armed with her bow, she cautiously opened it. Again, she found nothing. As she bent low to investigate, a large creature caught her side and knocked her weapon away. She retreated into the cabin, slamming the door behind her. Without a weapon with which to defend herself, she found a bottle of poison and coated it all over her body. It was a long night, but soon the dawn came and she still drew breath. Years later, her daughter designed this tattoo, inspired by her mother's harrowing tale and final attempt at defending herself."

However, at the end of a chaotic battle between two kingdoms, Benne was struck by an errant arrow and killed. Unwilling to bear the loss and struck by divine inspiration, Soma burned a magical tattoo into her flesh at that moment to bind Benne's spirit to her own. Together, they shared one body. Legends say that people slain by Soma would see Benne alongside her."

However, after the arrival of an enterprising newcomer that dabbled in tattooing, they rose to become the jewel of the Bernian army. Mere weeks after his arrival, the platoon's weapons had all been imprinted with a strange but complex marking. Wave after wave of enemy soldiers fell under their spears, and their reputation as juggernauts only grew until the war's end. Enemy prisoners would later relay the odd sensation they felt after being pricked by the platoon's blades, stressing that they suddenly felt their strength and litheness leave them."

					"There once lived a rogue name Esteban Gil, who had a habit of robbing the homes of extravagant spellcasters. He would tell his acquaintances that these targets always brought home and stashed away precious magical loot without any thought for security. The only problem Esteban ran into was if the homeowner happened to be home at the time of his raids. Over the course of his career, Esteban had been turned into a serpent, had his pants burnt off, and had his left foot exchanged with his right for almost a year. It took many requests and more than a few gold pieces, but a determined tattoo artist eventually managed to craft the right design for Esteban's daggers. One that rendered his targets a little less \"magical\" and a little more willing to part with their belongings during the little rogue's visits."

He would later remark that it felt as though his hand was being guided as he crafted the tattoo. Once applied, Valeria quickly realized the tattoo came with divine properties, blessed in recognition of the noblewoman's stewardship over the goddess' domain."

Pimble's skin, usually numb from the beating of the waterfall, tingled and glowed, and strange markings began to appear across their body. They felt a divine energy course through them and thanked the gods for this gift. Raiko was delighted to see the sprite stand up to its stunned bullies, and never again was Pimble the butt of their jokes."
