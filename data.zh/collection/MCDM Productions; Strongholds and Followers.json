								"1985年，我15岁，是赛普拉斯高中的二年级学生，这一年我在计算机科学课上与布拉德-托马斯和克里斯-斯蒂尔一起讨论埃里克和黑公司以及不朽的化身。他们是校外的朋友，是一个更大的团体的一部分，但我仍然和我在公寓楼里长大的孩子们一起玩耍。我知道克里斯和布拉德玩棋盘游戏和角色扮演游戏，我想加入。",

										"\"Ah, probably,\" the topaz wyrmling said. \"I'm not a theologist, but others have suggested that we topaz were made by Ket to ah...accelerate any potential victory.\" The little dragon turned to Meliora and smiled. \"Accelerate you, you might say. Dumb humans aren't much use to us.\"",
										"\"What...what happens when we're not around you anymore?\" Wenna asked, gripping the handle of her lute tightly.",
										"\"You know the answer. Our name for ourselves is the Carisovantinaar. It means the Quickening of the Way. The sapphire dragons,\" he said, nodding to Corovaxinar, \"project Awe, as is their right as the First Born. The rubies enhance arcanism, as you yourself saw, Meliora, when we fought alongside Orvosortiax.",
										"\"We topaz project...cleverness.\" It seemed the little dragon was amused.",
										"\"Intelligence,\" Dade said.",
										"The topaz dragon looked the eldest boy\u2014certainly a man now, after everything they'd been through\u2014up and down. \"Well that remains to be seen,\" he said. And Dade smiled, recognizing the joke. They'd all gotten used to the little dragon's mode of speech in the last few months.",
										"\"I don't think I like it,\" Meliora said.",
										"\"Now you know how I feel,\" Irdy said, smiling.",
										"\"What happens if we wake him up?\" Wenna asked.",
										"\"Her, I think you'll find. Oh, I should think it would be the end of this reality,\" Irdizavonax said casually. \"Or at least this version of it. Perhaps something more interesting will come along, that would be nice.\"",
										"\"The end...\" Dade said.",
										"\"Well it's true of all the eldest. I don't mean the creatures of meat and bone you call dragons. Echoes. I mean the real thing. The chromatics, the metallics. The eldest of them sleep to protect the world\u2014the ones remaining do, at any rate. Mostly I think the chromatics sleep because they know how angry their god would be if they dared to wake.\"",
										"\"But we have to talk to it!\" Wenna said. \"You saw what happened in Blackbottom! Our town may already be...be erased.\"",
										"\"There may be other ways.\" Irdizavonax's tendrils stroked his own chin in thought.",
										"\"Can't you...talk into her head?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"Oh of a surety,\" Irdizavonax said. \"But you see we jeweled dragons operate on similar wavelengths. And I am but a lowly wyrmling. Were I to attempt it...attempt it and succeed, she would almost certainly shatter my mind. Nothing personal, you understand.\" Irdy looked with some awe at the eldest sapphire. \"It's just the power of it.\"",
										"After a moment lost in overwhelming fascination, Irdy turned to Meliora. \"I believe this is your puzzle to solve, young wizard.\"",
										"Meliora shook her head. \"No,\" she said, backing away. \"Not after the Fane. Not after what that ruby dragon did to me.\"",
										"Irdy's tendrils drooped. \"I understand,\" he said. \"I'm sorry.\"",
										"\"Wenna,\" Jeremy said. \"Wenna, what about you?\"",
										"The young girl gripped her lute in a brief panic.",
										"\"Capital! Yes, tiny minstrel, sing us a song!\" Irdy said. Wenna cast him a dark look, but without much malice. She knew the dragon liked teasing her.",
										"Dade smiled and put a hand on her shoulder. \"You don't have to, if you don't want to.\" Had he not, she might have balked. But being condescended to pushed her over the edge. She jerked her shoulder away. \"I want to,\" she said defiantly.",
										"She tuned her lute and stepped forward. She always seemed frightened, frightened by everything, but music made her bold. Given the nature of her weapons, perhaps the boldest of them all. To face the ancient sapphire demigod, armed only with strings and a song.",
										"The song was a trifle. Nothing like the tunes the Riojan in Blackbottom taught her. It was a folk song from home, and it made the children glad and homesick.",
										"Before she could finish the song, a flash of sapphire energy\u2014and a being materialized in mid-stride, walking toward them.",
										"It was short, at least, shorter than Dade. Lithe. Humanoid in form, but otherwise an insect with brilliant, multifaceted eyes. It bore twin rapiers at its hips and wore emerald green armor that reflected light with a liquid sheen, unlike any substance they'd seen before. It reminded them of a beetle's carapace.",
										"Its antennae curled and twitched, sensing arcane forces in the air. It seemed full of cocky confidence and daring.",
										"\"A mantis knight!\" Irdy exclaimed in delight. \"Oh I'd forgotten about them. Well done, old lady.\"",
										"Wenna, Dade, and Jeremy had drawn their weapons. Credan started saying a prayer under his breath. Only Meliora did nothing, except wonder. She was already way ahead of them.",
										"\"This isn't real, is it?\" She could tell by the way it manifested.",
										"\"Very good,\" Irdizavonax said with a slight bow. \"Well, real is, as Orvosortiax taught you, mostly a collection of habits, and by that standard...this creature is very real.\"",
										"The creature stopped before them and bowed, one hand flourishing before it, the opposite leg extended slightly out.",
										"It spoke. Its voice was gay, like birdsong on a spring morning. \"Corovaxinar remembers things that were, things that should have been, and things that might yet be. I am Lady Eweshtleth. I hold the honor of the Gate and the Door.\"",
										"The children stared in rapt attention. Only Irdizavonax was not in awe. \"They're from the Court of...well, now the Court of Arcadia, I suppose,\" he said. \"But once the Mantis Knights were the chief lieutenants of the elves. Still are, I imagine. Somewhere.\"",
										"\"So this a...a memory?\" Meliora asked.",
										"\"Good guess, but I don't think so. Well, maybe. Rather I suspect this is a real person who lived...or will live, displaced chronographically.\"",
										"\"What?\" Several of the children asked.",
										"\"Oh she's from the past, probably. Or the future.\" When none of them spoke, Irdy took it upon himself to impress them with the gravity of the situation. \"This is the power of the Eldest.\"",
										"Meliora looked at the little dragon. Someday...if they succeeded, a million million years from now, Irdy would be like that massive creature slumbering before them. She wondered, privately, if the little dragon would remember them then.",
										"\"Corovaxinar welcomes you,\" the alien insect-woman spoke in a smooth, assured voice. Quite unlike the absentminded old professor they'd gotten used to in Irdy.",
										"Everyone looked to Irdy, but Irdy nodded to Meliora.",
										"\"Oh. Ah. Okay, um...hello. Ah, welcome to...our world.\"",
										"\"A world under siege,\" the Mantis Knight said to Meliora. \"Corovaxinar needs your help.\"",
										"\"We need hers,\" Meliora said.",
										"\"A happy mutuality of purpose,\" the knight said, and bowed its head, smiling.",
										"\"Oh I like her,\" Irdy said, turning to Dade with a smile.",
										"\"Prepare yourselves,\" the knight said, drawing herself up.",
										"\"Um...um for what?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"The War rages. Corovaxinar's projections falter. But you are not projections.\"",
										"\"But we're just...\" Credan gestured from Wenna to Jeremy. \"Kids.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth raised an eyebrow and one antenna twitched. \"Are you now? I think not. You summoned me. You found the hidden fastness of the Eldest when none of your ilk could gain its sanctum.",
										"\"I do not wot of Men. There are none yet, in my time. Or have not been any for millennia. But I deem thee worthy, if any are.\"",
										"\"'If any are,'\" Jeremy echoed, looking at his older brother. Dade shook his head in disbelief.",
										"\"Besides,\" Lady Eweshtleth said, nodding at the axe on Dade's hip, \"you bear The Edge That Severs Souls. A weapon that would master lesser beings.\"",
										"\"The Soul Carver!\" Irdizavonax exclaimed, taking a step back from Dade. \"Ah yes! Many threads converge. Much that was hidden is now revealed. Hah! And to think I stood with you when you found it. Ahh, to be alive and young in such a time.\"",
										"\"We didn't...\" Dade said, his hand on the pommel of the axe. \"We don't know what that means.\"",
										"\"Yes well don't let that stop you, by all means. You've managed to do pretty well for yourselves knowing not much more than a bunch of farmers' sons and daughters. No reason to change tactics now.\"",
										"\"What...\" Meliora said, taking a step toward the Mantis Knight. \"Where will we be going?\"",
										"The knight cleared her throat, and a portal opened behind her. A swirling, cloudy thing. \"I am the Gate and the Door,\" she said.",
										"\"The door to where?\" Meliora challenged.",
										"\"The World Below,\" Lady Eweshtleth said. The children gasped. They suspected, they feared, but knowing it was another thing altogether.",
										"\"I don't think...\" Credan put a hand on the talisman to St. Gryffyn the Stout. \"I don't think St. Gryffyn can hear me there.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth cocked her head as though listening to a voice, which she was, and nodded. \"Corovaxinar will maintain the portal and act as a conduit. Your saint will hear your prayers.\"",
										"\"What will we find there?\" Meliora asked.",
										"Lady Eweshtleth straightened and assumed a dour persona. \"Horrors,\" she said.",
										"\"How can we face them?\" Wenna asked.",
										"\"As with all things,\" Lady Eweshtleth laughed, her dour demeanor gone. She placed a hand on one elven rapier. \"With song, spell, and steel.\"",
										"She stepped aside and gestured to the portal. Dade and Jeremy looked at each other and then started forward. The others followed.",
										"At the edge of the portal, they stopped and looked behind them. Irdizavonax hadn't moved. Looking very small now, he stood alone.",
										"\"Aren't you coming with us?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"Coming with you? Into that?\" The small topaz dragon nodded at the gate. \"I beg your pardon! Hardly. No, you've already got Corovaxinar on your side\u2014I would be useless. A trifle. Besides, what use is a young sage compared with five stalwart heroes!\" He was teasing them. But he really wasn't going.",
										"Meliora walked back to him. She'd grown and was now a little taller than the topaz wyrmling. \"But we need you,\" she said, her eyes watering.",
										"\"Ah, you like me, and for that am I flattered, lady. But you do not need me. Think back to all you've done. What hand did I play? A humble narrator, little more. It was your actions, your bravery that led you here. All I did was...explain things frankly that I don't think you needed to know.\" \"We'll miss you,\" Meliora said, her voice quiet.",
										"\"Well, I'm not going anywhere,\" Irdizavonax said, looking around the cave. \"I'll be safe as houses here. And I'll be waiting, when you come back.\"",
										"\"Come on,\" Dade said, not unkindly.",
										"Meliora nodded and turned. But Irdizavonax stopped her.",
										"\"Meliora,\" he said, and she turned back.",
										"\"To answer your question,\" Irdy said, walking forward. His voice in her mind was quiet. She knew only she could hear him now. \"I will always remember you,\" Irdizavonax, the topaz wyrmling, said, his wide milky eyes looking up at her in wonder.",
										"Meliora started to cry.",
										"Irdizavonax took a step back and turned his mindspeech back up.",
										"\"Goodbye, tiny humans!\" He waved to them as Meliora joined her friends, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her robe. \"And good luck.\"",
										"The children stepped through the portal. Lady Eweshtleth saluted Irdizavonax with her rapier, and followed.",
										"\"I'll miss you too,\" Irdizavonax thought, to no one in particular."

										"\"Nevertheless.\"",
										"Irdy floated forward, almost nose to...faceplate with the machine.",

						"Large-scale battles have been part of the fantasy genre since Tolkien invented it in 1937 with The Hobbit and the Battle of Five Armies but, tellingly, that entire battle happens offscreen while Bilbo is knocked out.",
						"Like that battle, warfare in the game has always been something the GM was expected to handwave away. And that's fine for the core game\u2014it has enough to cover just managing skirmishes and everything else that can happen in an RPG. It's up to supplements like this to cover that material.",
						"Raising an army is a meaningful part of this book, and it plays heavily into the next book, {@footnote {@i Kingdoms & Warfare}|{@i Kingdoms & Warfare} by Matt Colville is currently unconverted for 5etools.}. Building a stronghold is only the beginning. The region around the stronghold becomes your demesne, and you might want to grow it beyond a single province and gain more power and influence. And in any event, as a GM I've always assumed the last step in acquiring a stronghold is {@i defending it in battle against those who would take it from you}.",
						"To this end, we present a system for resolving epic battles featuring hundreds or thousands of combatants on a side. Since that system gets an entire book after this one, we present only those bits you'll need to get the job done.",

								"One core assumption of this system is: 5th Edition players are already playing a very complex game and should not be expected to also play a whole other wargame.",
								"You may disagree with that. You might think that having a complete, robust, epic-scale miniatures wargame for 5th Edition would be keen. And I would agree with you! But you and I are not the only people to consider.",
								"Because every table I've played at had one or two players who loved wargames, one or two who didn't feel strongly about them one way or the other, and one or two who really didn't want to play a wargame of any sort. They showed up to play their character and had no interest in running an army.",
								"This system, therefore, is opt-in. You can award your players units, they can hire mercenary units, they can build a stronghold and attract units, and they may use them in battle. But a player who finds warfare distasteful can literally ignore it all, and while the other players are commanding an army, they'll just be playing their characters. While you can use this system all by itself to resolve a battle\u2014or use the rules in {@book Appendix: Simple Warfare|SaF|11} (page 241) for something even faster and more streamlined\u2014this system assumes a battle (clash of armies) takes place at the {@b same time} as an encounter (PCs fighting monsters and bad guys).

The armies clash outside the castle walls, or over the nearby hill, or along the road leading to the town, but we don't worry about where the units are standing, or how far away they are from each other, or which unit is next to which.

My campaigns assumed the codices should be kept secure in the hands of responsible, powerful NPCs and that, when they are stolen or they disappear under mysterious circumstances, the PCs will be deployed to recover them and return them.",

It takes place over four parts, and each part can be completed in one or two sessions of play, depending on your group's playstyle and how long you like to play in a single sitting. If all goes according to plan over the course of this adventure, the player characters will expose an usurping lord, fight orcs, acquire a stronghold, defend it from an invading army, win the admiration of a town filled with potential vassals, and make political connections within the Barony of Bedegar.",

They basically begin right before the action in this adventure. There are several ways to get a stronghold: a local noble awards one, you buy one, or\u2014perhaps the most common: you clear out a ruin and say, \"Let's make this our base!\" So we use this adventure to show off arguably the most complex iteration of these rules: The players clear out a castle infested with orcs, become embroiled in the local political landscape, and must decide how they're going to use their new stronghold. (Is it a castle with a keep, tower, and temple inside? Or just a huge keep? Not an insignificant question when an enemy army is bearing down on you!)",

I can't wait to run her the next time I deploy this adventure. 😃",

Its map would show you a series of far-flung baronies connected by disused roads, surrounded by hazardous wilderness.
