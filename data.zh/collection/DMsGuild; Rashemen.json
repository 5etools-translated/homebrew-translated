Each lodge has its own personality, expressed by their fighting styles and appearance. Lodge are protected by their own telthor, usually of a creature related to the lodge's name. The members of each lodge are grouped into \"Fangs,\" elite fighting forces ready to answer the Iron Lord's call to defend the nation. Initiation rites vary by lodge but invariably require a demonstration of fighting prowess and completion of various tests such as all-night drinking contests or single handed battle against every member of the lodge. Have you joined one of the large, well-known lodges or are you a member of a small lodge few have heard of? Whatever the case, most Rashemaar look to you with respect and admiration.",

					"A former follower of Imzel and self-proclaimed durthan, Mishara Viadrova is a powerful wychlaran who turned against the dark order after Imzel's death and the fall of the durthan. For years, she worked alongside the lower ranks of wychlaran, shunned by her fellow casters for her involvement with the dark arts of the durthan. Through years of tireless effort and a spotless record of integrity, goodness, and obedience to the wychlaran, Mishara was slowly promoted through the ranks. Ultimately, she reached the council of the othlor and fell under the tutelage of the aging abjuration specialist, Kovorina Dvilich. Mishara endured a relatively short tutelage at the hands of Kovorina, mastering protective magics and the communal binding capabilities that other wychlaran could scarcely imagine. After Kovorina's death shortly thereafter, the othlor selected Mishara\u2014the only qualified candidate who could replace Kovorina on the council\u2014to join the inner circle of othlor.",
					"When Mishara became an othlor, she carved a new mask in the shape of a wolf's visage: a symbol of her rebirth and the loyal ferocity with which she would protect the wychlaran and Rashemen from the forces of darkness that threatened to destabilize the nation. But every mask has two sides and ultimately acts as a disguise to show the world only what the wearer wishes them to see. While Mishara is dedicated to the protection of the order, she regularly employs contacts from her durthan past and other unsavory magical methods the wychlaran would not approve of in order to ensure the protection of the realm. Her position in the othlor places her above scrutiny, allowing her actions to go unchecked.",
					"Utilizing her communal binding mastery, Mishara has the ability to commune with hundreds and thousands of ants, spiders, and mites across the realm and outlying nations. These creatures act as spies and informants, allowing Mishara to collect seemingly impossible information from even the most secret of conversations. Her mastery of shared spellcasting allows her to cast spells through these insects, whether they are separated by inches or hundreds of miles. With careful focus and expert attention, Mishara secretly intervenes in dangerous situations across the realms; sometimes as a long-distance healer who saves a crucial figure from an expert assassination, other times as the magical assassin who removes a crucial threat to the Rashemi.",
					"Despite her good intentions, Mishara's connections with the underground durthan witches, immense spy network, and access to dangerous and forbidden knowledge act as constant temptations to use her powers for ill. While the othlor's rigid rules and delineation of light and dark magics have historically held the wychlaran together and ensured the safety of Rashemen, Mishara has begun to question, once again, whether these rules are the correct path forward. With ever-evolving magical forces threatening invasion from Thay and the other bordering countries, it is unclear how Rashemen could survive without wychlaran who are willing to skirt the boundaries of magical law and reshape the rules that govern the wychlaran. Mishara's alliances and connections, whether for good or ill, may shape the future of Rashemen; as great powers rise and fall, knowledge is the true magic that holds this nation together."

He usually manifests to challenge intruders, unless they can convince him they mean Rashemen no harm.",

					"For most of their youth Zasvor Temraid lived on the streets of Immilmar. When their magical abilities manifested in their early teens, they were pickpocketing a foreigner and nearly killed the man by electrocuting him. The city authorities quickly detained Zasvor and waited for the wychlaran to arrive. They were ferried away to the Urlingwood to receive the blessings of the spirits before being sequestered. Through this entire process, Zasvor barely spoke a word, stunned that they had nearly killed a man and even more so that they were an Old One.",
					"Very quickly the other vremyonni and wychlaran realized not only were they a quick study of the craft, they were a prodigy pointing out flaws in old designs and ways to improve them. An eldritch engine that laid dormant for half a century was finally activated after Zasvor examined it for a few minutes.",
					"Zasvor's prodigious skills only grew with age until they were looked upon as the most intelligent of all the vremyonni, both young and old. The hathran and othlor's frequently invited them to be a part of the decision-making process when it came to any and everything arcane. Sometime after they reached their",
					"35th birthday, the othlor's blessed them with one of the greatest gifts a vremyonni can be given: longevity. Their lifespan now mirrored that of most elves. With their lifespan greatly expanded, there was nothing they couldn't learn, no great project they couldn't finish. All of Zasvor's time was dedicated to making better weapons of war to defend the Rashemi. Their behavior was that of a fervorous zealot.",
					"It was because of their zealous fervor that their betrayal was all the more devastating. To this day, no one knows what drove them to betray all that they had held dear for nearly two and a half centuries. But one fateful day they turned on their fellow vremyonni, killing a number of them and Siradhal Nyenebotra, a well known hathran that was visiting. Zasvor stole a number of ancient texts and schema before teleporting away.",
					"Three centuries later they are still wanted by the wychlaran. They proved rather elusive, constantly changing their appearance, traveling between demiplanes of their own creation and never staying in one location or plane for any extended length of time.",
					"While Zasvor is constantly moving they have made powerful friends and allies since they've left Rashemen. The knowledge that they took with them has never been shared with any others as far as the wychlaran can tell. Those that come across them and aren't seeking to end their lives can persuade them to aid them if their cause is just or curious enough."
