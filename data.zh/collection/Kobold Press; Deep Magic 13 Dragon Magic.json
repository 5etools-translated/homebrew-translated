The cost to create these items is ten times the normal cost of the item. The number and type of items that can be made from a particular dragon's corpse is up to the GM, but considering how much violence must be inflicted on a dragon to bring it down, the amount of salvageable raw matieral is low; dragons don't die from superficial damage. Any type of melee weapon or bow can be made. The resulting weapon, in the hands of a proficient wielder, does an additional 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the dragon whose body was used to create the weapon. For example, a blue dragon dagger does 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6 lightning damage. Any type of armor can be made except padded or chain (shirt or mail). The resulting armor or shield, in the panoply of a proficient user, provides resistance to the damage type appropriate to the source dragon. For example, black dragon scale mail gives its wearer resistance to acid damage."
