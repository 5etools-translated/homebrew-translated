						"黑暗幻想和恐怖长期以来一直是讲故事的人最喜欢的类型，更不用说听故事的人了。从最早的人类围着火堆，编造居住在黑暗、荒野、海洋和星空之间的怪物的故事开始，我们就从未失去过被惊吓的快感，被吓得魂飞魄散的肾上腺素，同时知道--或者至少希望--我们是安全的，没有任何真正的危险。",
						"Grim Hollow和它的Etharis世界为角色扮演游戏爱好者提供了参与那些黑暗幻想背景下的惊险刺激的能力。无论恐怖是以自然界最红的牙齿和爪子的形式出现，还是通过凡人在权力欲望驱使下的行为所散发出的恐惧，或者是无生命的怪物在无月的夜晚晃动，渴望熄灭生命的亮光的恐怖，伊萨里斯都充满了威胁，非常适合许多不同风格的基于恐怖的黑暗幻想活动。",
						"更重要的是，本书的规则提供了允许玩家对他们的角色进行实验的手段，他们面临着最可怕的命运：屈服于黑暗并被它改变。成为怪物的生存恐怖可以使与怪物战斗显得苍白无力。",
						"我们感谢支持我们创作的9138名支持者（%0%）。你们压倒性的信任给了我们手段和动力，使这本书成为它可以成为的一切。我们希望你能在本书中发现，无论你是玩家还是GM，都能找到创造一个活动的想法和规则，深深地捕捉到人们凝视黑暗的感觉，希望能生存下来，但又害怕会有什么结果--或者是自己的结果。",

								"在Etharis的世界里，角色与典型的高度幻想活动是相反的。善良的人蜷缩在他们脆弱的文明堡垒中，而邪恶的人则在这片土地上自由地游荡。冒险家们鬼鬼祟祟地在阴影中潜行，总是意识到紧跟在他们身后的危险，或者潜伏在他们身体和灵魂中的危险。欢迎来到灰暗谷地!",

										"在这样一个世界里，英雄怎么可能存在？胜利到底是什么样子的？在这样的环境中，玩家在处理角色创建和游戏本身时应该考虑到这些因素。",
										"奇幻小说中的人物背景故事很少围绕着快乐和平凡的事件展开。在黑暗幻想中，这些背景故事通常更加黑暗和戏剧化。",
										"是什么激励和塑造了黑暗幻想的主角？失去所爱的人。被最亲近的人背叛。人物感到无力阻止的灾难性事件。不可侵犯和不可抗拒的力量伸出手来，以冷酷和恶毒的态度塑造人物的生活和个性。",
										"Etharis的世界是由这些可怕的事件所定义的，因此，其中的人物也理应如此。这些环境和事件会如何导致一个冒险家的生活，勇敢面对大多数人在恐惧中逃离的危险？你的角色是否变得愤世嫉俗，只为自己的利益着想？他们是否团结起来，反击绝望，决心为剩下的最后一丝光亮而战？你的角色在为什么而战？",
										"这些主题也在游戏本身中发挥作用。随着世界变成废墟，正常的角色扮演的各种元素都被颠覆了。安全变成了一个相对的术语，所以像（%0%）或（%1%）这样的法术可能比在传统的高度幻想环境中更有用。在荒野中游荡的怪物已经成功地摧毁了整个文明，这使得仔细挑选你的战斗变得很重要。也许并不是每一场战斗或遭遇都值得冒着风险与黑暗进行整个战争的代价。"

										"在狰狞山谷中塑造角色的一部分是承认黑暗力量的力量。这个设定提供了许多将这些力量融入你的角色的选择。与其说你只是拿起了一个变身布恩，或者像使用额外的技能熟练度那样使用巫术，这些选择在与特定的角色事件相联系时效果最好。也许你欣然接受了这些力量，以此来实现你的角色所寻求的复仇，或者是在月圆之夜发生的一次不情愿的意外。你的角色是否对这些事件或选择感到后悔？或者他们完全接受他们所获得的力量？",
										"一旦获得这些能力，这些能力是出了名的难以处理。当与其他人类打交道时，暴露出你的真实本性会导致严重的问题。随着你的能力的增长，它的本质变得越来越难以掩盖和控制，因此也更难避免你的选择所带来的后果。也许值得投资于（%0%）的熟练度或能力，如（%1%），以便更好地融入正常人之中。",
										"唉，如果情况迫使你在别人身边使用你的力量，即使这样也可能不够。请注意。当你变得和你所反对的黑暗势力一样令人畏惧时，自然机构，如农民的干草叉的末端，可以和超自然的机构一样危险。"

										"袭击Etharis的最大灾难可能是众神的消失。除了人类万神殿之外，很少有人知道他们堕落的真相，但所有人都知道，向众神祈祷不会带来任何援助和救济。始终为有需要的人提供治疗和保护的神圣魔法消失了，现在很少有人还能记得那个黄金时代。",
										"作为一个玩家，神圣魔法的极度匮乏为那些希望扮演牧师或圣骑士的玩家提供了某些挑战。你的存在是一个值得注意的事件，你应该与你的GM讨论你如何保留你的魔法，以及这可能对整个世界产生什么影响。对多类的要求更加严格，应该把它作为一个主要情节点纳入故事。",
										"诸神的死亡会带来严重的后果，即使对于那些不想参加神级的人来说也是如此。牧师、圣骑士和一般的宗教组织往往是角色扮演游戏中治疗和治愈魔法的主要来源，所以他们的缺席提供了一个重大挑战。当你不能随便走进最近的寺庙，捐献一笔巨额的金币来治疗疾病、诅咒和其他状况时，情况就会严重得多。",
										"同样，复活也是几乎不可能的。玩家应该意识到，在伊萨里斯，生命更加珍贵。即使是神职人员提供的更平凡的服务，如给予祝福和出售圣水，也是罕见的。对抗黑暗军团的有用物品被高度重视，其价值变得更大，这意味着应该少见和少用。"

										"作为一个制作奥术法术师的玩家，无论是巫师、巫师还是术士，你都要面对一个迷信和敌对的民众。在Etharis的许多地区都制定了许可证制度以规范魔法，所以对于那些寻求合法的魔法实践的人来说，有效的许可证是一件重要的装备。巫师是主要的持牌施法者，而术士几乎从不属于魔法组织或学院。巫师凭借其与生俱来的能力，介于两者之间，其逃亡者与持证从业者一样多。",
										"决定你的角色属于哪一类，并与你的GM一起确定可能适用于你的施法许可的任何限制。即使是有执照的施法者也不能完全免于普通人的怨恨，所以在拥挤的酒馆中挥舞魔杖和魔法书可能不是最明智的决定。",
										"如果你不是在扮演一个施法者，你应该考虑你作为一个角色对魔法的感受。你是在卡斯蒂内兰省，在忠实守望者的严厉注视下长大的？或者你来自北地，在那里，魔法就像森林和河流一样是日常生活的一部分？无论你在冒险生涯开始时对奥术魔法的看法如何，你也应该考虑这种看法是如何随时间变化的。你对奥术魔法的不信任是愚蠢的，因为你现在看到它被善良和高贵的施法者所挥舞？或者说，你与奥术施法者的个人互动告诉你，你把对奥术的恐惧写成迷信，反而是一个明智和谨慎的选择？"

										"角色扮演游戏中的冒险者是旅行者。这是工作的一个组成部分，也是整个游戏的一个组成部分。通常情况下，旅行是沿着一个维护良好、有巡逻的道路系统进行的，偶尔也会进入自然界的荒野，寻找一些扰乱世界正常秩序的卑劣生物。",
										"在一个黑暗的幻想环境中，不能依靠信使和巡逻队，任何走出镇墙安全范围的人都会把自己的生命掌握在自己手中。夜晚尤其危险，因为任何光线都会成为等待在墨色黑暗中的生物的信标。在Etharis的旅行不适合胆小的人，可能会被证明是相当于任何故事的高潮的挑战。",
										"作为一个在Etharis荒野中冒险的人物，首先要了解的是，没有所谓的安全宿营地。当夜幕降临时，一切都会成为公平的游戏，所以最好做好准备。单独设岗可能是不够的，你应该始终有一个计划来唤醒你的盟友，以处理不可避免的复杂情况。法术可以在这方面提供帮助，无论是{@spell alarm}、{@spell magic mouth}，还是任何可以在数百英尺外听到的各种声波法术。暗视对站岗的人来说特别有用，可以避免用火把或篝火来宣传你的存在。但即使如此，暗视也不是完美的，它的局限性会让某些威胁占上风。防护和保护法术，如{@spell leomund's tiny hut|PHB|tiny hut}或{@spell rope trick}，对于在危险地区的长途跋涉中生存很有价值。",
										"在Etharis，社会孤立状态的一个额外后果是：信息传播非常缓慢。由于没有可靠的信使和有限的魔法，冒险者有时是定居点之间沟通的主要来源。这可能会导致一些问题，但如果他们不想让自己的事迹传出去，也可能对他们有利。"

										"在面临困难的情况下，有些人奋不顾身，出于慈善的意图而采取行动，寻求帮助需要帮助的人。在一个黑暗的幻想环境中，大多数人属于硬币的另一面。伊萨里斯的居民主要是那些为自己着想的人，他们常常损害他人的利益。无论是诡计多端的贵族依靠他人的辛勤劳动而生活在奢华之中，还是迷信的乡民为了不被淹没在可怕的贫困海洋中而不择手段，伊萨里斯的人们总是在关注他们从任何协议中得到的东西。在这个世界上，排外主义、偏执狂和普通的残忍是一天中的主流。",
										"与NPC打交道是角色扮演的基石，但上述条件使它在Etharis成为一个特别危险的命题。你在这个世界上遇到的陌生人不会随意提供帮助。即使是轻松的微笑和甜言蜜语也有其局限性，所以要准备好在不太友好的条件下与人打交道。",
										"贿赂、恐吓、胁迫，有时甚至是赤裸裸的勒索，都比呼吁怜悯或同情更常见。当试图达成某种安排时，知道对方想要什么是很有价值的信息，所以智慧与魅力同样重要。诸如 \"魅惑 \"之类的法术似乎是一个简单的答案，但在Etharis，对魔法的恐惧和憎恨在用来篡夺一个人的意志时被放大了。而且这些法术确实会失效。",
										"在Etharis，这种不信任和偏执使得一些能力，在其他类型的战役或环境中是事后的，变得非常有价值。例如，由你的背景能力提供的好处，可能会像快速武器或火球一样拯救你的生命。在与其他人打交道时，能够依靠朋友提供一顿饭和一个安全的住所可能是你最有力的工具，特别是在一个低查里斯玛的聚会中。在一个新的城镇中，能够找到至少一张友好的面孔可能是生与死的区别。"

										"在游戏中，这意味着玩家角色比传统的幻想角色扮演活动中的角色相对较弱。晋级到更高的级别往往需要比一些玩家习惯的更大的努力和更大的牺牲。这是黑暗幻想的一个元素，反映了持续危险的主题。在建立一个角色时，明智的做法是不要把进阶视为理所当然，而应更多地关注眼前的生存能力。一个角色只有在获得四级后才会发挥自己的作用，以获得你需要的那个法术或特技，这个角色很可能无法通过四级生存。",
										"然而，长期规划绝对是一种选择。本书中提出的许多选择都是在考虑到持续进步的情况下设计的。关键是不要把所有的希望都寄托在对未来水平的假设上。在危险四伏的情况下，未来会变得非常不确定，把注意力集中在当前的生存上往往更有帮助。"

										"当这些新生的凡人把他们的思想转向他们的创造者时，诸神发现了一个无尽的信徒的来源。他们的崇拜将诸神提升到更高的高度，保证了他们转动宇宙之轮的能力。",
										"但诸神并不孤单。在他们有序领域的边缘潜伏着Aether Kindred--难以理解的纯混沌生命，他们比诸神本身还要早。Kindred大多满足于保持不参与的状态，但神明偶尔也会发现现实中的一片混乱--一颗恒星失踪了，一片海洋干涸了，整个城市消失在虚空中。",
										"当Sommerkin的整个种族有一天消失后，诸神决定他们已经受够了。Aether Kindred是对他们力量的一种积极威胁。诸神担心，有一天他们所建立的一切都会被剥夺。他们需要现在就出手，趁着他们还有信徒的信仰，站在他们力量的巅峰。",
										"因此，所有的神灵，不论是善的还是恶的，都联合起来，作为东道主，对金德人发起了攻击。这场战争被称为 \"太虚战争\"。",
										"没有人能够准确地说出参加战争的神灵们发生了什么。一些历史学家说这是一场大屠杀。另一些人认为，诸神被他们试图打败的长生恐怖所吞噬。还有人说，一些神明从这个平面撤退到金德人无法到达的地方。虽然不能确定此后诸神发生了什么，但可以肯定的是他们被彻底打败了。",
										"在伟大的万神殿中，只有最年轻的四个人幸存下来。建设者高特（Galt the Builder）、马利根（Maligant Warclad）、智慧者乌尔米尔（Ulmyr the Wise）和壁炉的奥蕾莉亚（Aurelia of the Hearth）。也许是出于谨慎或恐惧，他们在乙太战争中按兵不动。因此，他们是唯一留下来收拾残局的人，成为培养Etharis的未来的责任。",
										"如果说乙太战争有任何一线希望的话，那就是金德人后来从未露面。人们相信，在摧毁了这么多神灵之后，这些恐怖的人睡得很沉，也许需要休息来治愈他们的伤口。但一旦他们再生，他们很可能会对其余的神的创造物进行报复。",
										"不管是什么原因，这让四神族只能靠自己的力量。当幸存的诸神离开指导伊萨利斯的凡人时，他们决定联合起来。他们的想法是建立一个理想的帝国，\"高于一切 \"的帝国，作为所有凡人效仿的闪亮灯塔。这个想法成为布拉克帝国。它的第一任皇帝，因多里乌斯一世，将成为伊萨里斯所有国家的照明灯。为此，四位神人向他赠送了四件神圣的神器，使他能够明智地统治和保护他的帝国。",
										"有一段时间，一切都很好。不幸的是，这种救赎方法带来了自身毁灭的种子。布拉赫帝国如此热爱他们的皇帝，以至于他们决定让他的血统永远保持纯净。守炉人教会颁布了《永恒血统法令》，规定只有因多里乌斯一世的血统才能登上王位。就这样，他们强迫他的后代通婚，削弱了他们的血统。这种做法的悲惨结果最终体现在疯狂皇帝利奥波德身上。",
										"当利奥波德接触到神器时，他的思想和灵魂立即与四位神人相连--这使他们都陷入了疯狂。高尔基、马利尼特、乌尔米尔和奥蕾莉亚相互争斗，各自争夺宇宙唯一真神的地位。这在诸神的终结中达到了顶点，当时这些最后剩下的神祗互相毁灭。",
										"伊萨里斯作为一个无神的世界继续存在。虽然神的力量仍然存在，但它只是以前荣耀的一个影子。"

For this reason, it is appropriate for the level of dice in the Beast Pool to be represented in-game, allowing the characters to react without metagaming and breaking immersion.",
								"One way to accomplish this is by interactions with NPCs. News may reach the party of some supernatural phenomenon which has the locals on edge, or the party's local informant warns them of an increase in monster attacks. Other times the party's surroundings themselves change to represent the growing threat. Omens and portents foretell disaster, and the creatures the party encounters take on a more disturbing appearance.",

The GM can award dice to the party based on their actions or at specific plot moments within the game.

Furthermore, certain actions may result in the reward of a Resolve Die if they represent events which would bolster the party's determination. Rare acts of self-sacrifice, kindness, or charity may act as a light in the darkness and help the party to forge ahead, as represented by the addition of a Resolve Die to the pool.",

In certain circumstances it may make sense to allow party members to use abilities listed under the Beast Pool, such as when their actions align with the goals of the villain, and a GM may want to dip into the Resolve Abilities to boost the difficulty of an encounter.",
								"Another method of customization is by altering the abilities themselves. The Outnumbered ability from the Beast Pool, for example, can easily be adapted to summoning spells and moved over to the Resolve Pool. Inner Strength can be used to boost the healing of a fighter's Second Wind ability or to increase the level of a {@spell cure wounds} spell. Summoning the Beast can easily be swapped out for an appearance by whatever villain the GM has set as the primary antagonist of the campaign. All of these are appropriate uses of Influence Dice.",
								"Depending on the actions of the party and the GM, there may be a situation where a pool of dice fills completely and stays there for an extended period of time. One option to prevent this disparity is to allow a trade-off between the two. When a player would gain a Resolve Die, they may instead choose to decrease the Beast Pool by one. Similarly, when the GM would add a die to the Beast Pool, the increase in threat can be represented just as well by decreasing the Resolve Pool by one. This provides for a more fluid interplay between the two pools, acting almost like a tug-of-war on the weave of Fate's tapestry.",
								"As a final note, one bit of warning regarding these rules: in general, pitting party members against one another is something to be avoided. If you want to include this as an option in your game, or if you contemplate using some of these rules to that effect, we strongly recommend discussing this with your group ahead of time to make sure that everyone agrees with the idea. The most important thing is to have fun, and the rules should serve that goal, even if they have to be bent or broken at times."

						"Another method of customization is by altering the abilities themselves. The Outnumbered ability from the Beast Pool, for example, can easily be adapted to summoning spells and moved over to the Resolve Pool. Inner Strength can be used to boost the healing of a fighter's Second Wind ability or to increase the level of a {@spell cure wounds} spell. Summoning the Beast can easily be swapped out for an appearance by whatever villain the GM has set as the primary antagonist of the campaign. All of these are appropriate uses of Influence Dice.",
						"Depending on the actions of the party and the GM, there may be a situation where a pool of dice fills completely and stays there for an extended period of time. One option to prevent this disparity is to allow a trade-off between the two. When a player would gain a Resolve Die, they may instead choose to decrease the Beast Pool by one. Similarly, when the GM would add a die to the Beast Pool, the increase in threat can be represented just as well by decreasing the Resolve Pool by one. This provides for a more fluid interplay between the two pools, acting almost like a tug-of-war on the weave of Fate's tapestry.",
						"As a final note, one bit of warning regarding these rules: in general, pitting party members against one another is something to be avoided. If you want to include this as an option in your game, or if you contemplate using some of these rules to that effect, we strongly recommend discussing this with your group ahead of time to make sure that everyone agrees with the idea. The most important thing is to have fun, and the rules should serve that goal, even if they have to be bent or broken at times."

				"随着时间的推移，沉沦者已经学会了利用沉睡在他们血液中的一小部分神力。这种力量仍然记得堕落者以前的目的，并且可以在非常需要的时候利用它来帮助那些曾经呼唤神灵力量的人。这种能力既危险又强大，因为有很多人想用武力夺取它。堕落的神职人员为了恢复他们自己衰弱的力量而试图吸干堕落者的能量，吸血鬼试图喝下被污染的神性之泉，甚至那些与这个世界上的强大实体相联系的人，都是堕落天使的潜在掠夺者。事实上，有些人已经发现了这个秘密，并愿意为获得它而不惜一切代价。"

				"历史会重演。甚至在人类有他们的扩张和后裔时代之前，其他种族就已经在Etharis建立了帝国。精灵和矮人都有他们的时代，其他更古老的种族也是如此。今天斯泰伦瓦尔德的矮人居住的地方曾经是一个古老帝国的所在地，它超越了后来的任何一个帝国。这个帝国的名字已经消失了，只有最古老的故事的碎片化遗迹甚至暗示了那个种族曾经达到的宏伟高度。",
				"从精灵和矮人的历史中可以收集到的信息是，在某一时刻，一场可怕的灾难降临在这片土地上，将这个古老帝国的任何痕迹抹去。这场灾难来得很突然，没有任何警告，人们相信没有任何东西能够幸存下来。有些东西确实存在。",
				"当人类崛起并开始威胁精灵和矮人的时候，斯泰伦瓦尔德的矮人被迫在他们的山地据点中挖掘得更深，以抵御围攻。在黑暗深处，甚至在被证明是他们的救命稻草的金刚砂下面，矮人发现了可以追溯到大灾变之前的密封室。随着封印被打破，一个古老的咒语被解除，密室中的居民开始从他们长达千年的沉睡中醒来。",
				"在灾难消灭他们的文明之前的日子里，这些 \"做梦的人 \"中有一群人预见到了危险，并想出了一个在灾难中生存的计划。时间在梦中的流逝是不同的，古人试图利用这一事实将自己从时间的流逝中解放出来。悬浮在现实和梦境之间，封存在地下深处，只要有必要，他们就可以生活在永久的沉睡状态中，并在那场将消灭他们其他物种的灾难中幸存下来。",
				"这个计划成功了，但在梦境中生活了这么久，却产生了不可预知的后果。醒来后，做梦的人发现他们无法再区分梦境和记忆，两者都迅速从他们的头脑中消失。结果是出现了一个新的种族，他们对自己的历史一无所知，只有半变形的图像和对一个可能存在也可能不存在的地方和时间的梦幻般的印象。",
				"现在，做梦的人在一个似乎是醒着的恶梦的世界中努力适应。无论他们的历史如何，他们都被证明是头脑灵活和强壮的，能够学习新的任务并很好地执行它们。长期的沉睡使他们奇怪地精力充沛，甚至能够超越传说中的矮人的耐力。即便如此，睡眠仍然是做梦者最自在的地方，他们有一个习惯，只要没有直接的任务出现，就会迅速打瞌睡。"
