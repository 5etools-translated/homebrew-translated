												"{@i Total Party Kill Bestiary}的特点是一些具有独特特征的生物，总结起来就是将其归类为泰坦生物。泰坦尼克号生物是真正巨大的--具有独特的解剖结构，将其作为单一目标处理是没有意义的。它有多个部分，每个部分的功能都像一个独立的生物，依靠怪物的核心统计数据来实现其大部分效果。每个部分都有与该生物的基本统计块相同的攻击力、抵抗力、免疫力和蓄力奖励。各个部分都受到条件和其他效果的影响，除非在部分特征中另有明确说明。一个泰坦尼克号生物的统计资料描述了该生物在其每个部分所占的空间，以及它的高度。如果你使用的是实物缩影，你不可能有一个合适的巨型缩影，所以你可能要即兴创作一些东西。由于泰坦尼克号生物是如此之大，比它小的生物总是可以占据相同的空间，或者在泰坦尼克号生物的空间内移动而不受到惩罚，而且泰坦尼克号生物既不采取也不挑起机会攻击。",
												"每个泰坦尼克号生物都有一个核心部分。如果 \"核心 \"部分的命中率降至零，泰坦尼克号生物就会被杀死。只要它的命中率为零，其他部分就会变成{@condition incapacitated}，但生物作为一个整体仍然活着，而且很好。有些生物可以在战斗中恢复（%1%）的部分，而其他生物则不能。一般来说，除非泰坦生物有能力让它恢复{@condition incapacitated}的部分，否则它只能在完成长时间的休息后才能这样做，这样可以让每个部分单独花费命中率来恢复命中率。",
												"在战斗中，每个部分都有一个固定的主动权结果，它根据这个结果行动。在每个部分的回合中，如果该部分有一个速度，整个生物在该部分的回合中可以按照正常的移动规则进行移动。在某些情况下，一个生物可能在某个特定部分的回合中拥有一定的速度，例如一条拥有 \"翅膀 \"部分的龙只有在其 \"翅膀 \"行动时才有飞行速度。",
												"角色可以尝试爬上泰坦尼克号生物作为他们运动的一部分，方法是做一个{@skill Athletics}或{@skill Acrobatics}的检查（他们自己选择），与该生物的{@skill Athletics}或{@skill Acrobatics}检查相对立（DM选择）。成功意味着他们可以沿着该生物移动到他们速度的一半，失败意味着他们留在原地，无论是在地上还是在该生物身上。做这个尝试不需要行动，但一个生物每回合只能尝试一次。如果一个生物在攀爬泰坦尼克号时受到伤害，或者强制移动效果会在攀爬时推拉他们，他们必须做一个力量或灵巧的拯救动作（他们自己选择），其DC为所受伤害的一半或10，以高者为准。成功意味着他们坚持住了，留在原地。失败意味着他们坠落，在泰坦尼克号生物的空间里掉到地上，并受到相应的坠落伤害。泰坦尼克号生物在对目前正在攀爬它们的生物的所有攻击中都处于劣势。",
												"当涉及到瞄准一个生物的部分时，你应该使用你最好的判断力。如果施法者在生物的范围内，远程攻击应该能够瞄准任何部分，但近战攻击和触摸法术只能瞄准角色可以想象得到的部分。例如，一个拿着剑的战士不可能攻击一个60英尺高的石像的头部，他只能砍腿。",
												"同样地，在对泰坦尼克号生物施加状态效果时，请使用你最好的判断。例如，对龙的尾巴施放（%0%），可能不会起作用。它需要以生物的头部或核心为目标才有效。同样地，你可能也不能敲打巨魔的手臂（1%）。否则，大多数效果只能影响生物的一个部分。例如，你可以击晕一个生物的胳膊或腿，使其无法行动，但生物的其他部分会正常行动。最后，大多数泰坦尼克号生物对强制移动和传送效果是免疫的，除非它们希望被影响。",

Hybrids are melee bruisers with a lot of hit points and comparatively low AC. They can use their Brawn over Brains trait to make Constitution saving throws in place of Intelligence or Charisma, making them strong against effects that force those saving throws. Hybrids should try to spend as much time as possible in melee and get up close to ranged attackers to prevent them exploiting the hybrid's lack of long-range abilities.

With advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks, this essence also excels against any characters that rely on being hidden.",

You can also give the party an easier time by putting the hybrid in a large, wide-open area where its relatively slow speed gives the party a chance to pick it apart with ranged attacks.",

Most essence options also add a way for the hybrid to grapple a creature, and since the hybrids are Huge in size, they can move a Medium creature they are grappling without being slowed down. Combine that with swim, fly, or climb speeds and a hybrid can easily split the party by pulling one character into a hard-to-reach spot before tearing into them."

														"Magic at its most dangerous and unpredictable, a living spellstorm serves as a reminder to all spellcasters that we are but children playing with an enigmatic force. What a wizard spends their life trying to master, a spellstorm achieves by merely existing. I consulted my other magical companions on the matter of living spellstorm, and each offered their unique perspective. Archmagister King simply dictated \"I need it\". I still don't know what for. Ionia lamented its existence, calling it \"a wound in nature, festering with agony and pain\". Elkus said he'd \"consult the gods and get back to me\". He never did, so I can only assume he learned nothing of value. Shana went off to try and find one and I haven't heard from her since, and Johan sent me a formal letter in response stating: \"Legal counsel has advised me to not discuss this matter further\". Clearly, I am the only one among my companions who respects the value of research!"

Use Cyclone to draw characters up into the spellstorm's body, subjecting them to its Spellform for extra damage. Remember the spellstorm is far more intelligent than its animate spell relatives.

One day, as the king lounged in his throne, a ranger approached. Old and wise, she offered to entertain the king with a display of her pets. Among them, a shimmering orange-yellow cobra.

The ranger offered the serpent to the king, and he took it gingerly. \"Be careful, he bites,\" were the last words the king heard before the snake's fangs plunged into his neck.

Let the behemoth mimics be a lesson to those who are overconfident in their skills, a fitting punishment for the rampant insufferable arrogance within the adventuring community."

								"Each behemoth mimic is like a miniature dungeon. Due to their huge size and nature as a creature, object, and structure, running these encounters is no small task. One of the most exciting aspects of the behemoth mimics is their customizable nature. Each {@creature mimic|MM} possesses a trait that allows it to appear as an \"ordinary\" object or structure of a certain type, with specific sections included for the combat purposes. Beyond that, the layout and design of your behemoth mimic is something for you to create. You could make the interior of your mimic a dizzying maze, fill its section with loot, or even add minions that have made the mimic their home. A more detailed mimic makes the disguise more convincing to your players in the metagame, in addition to increasing the encounter's difficulty. Consider the merits of presenting your behemoth mimic in the form of a battle map to explore, rather than a creature to be fought (at least at first). The mark of a well-made behemoth mimic encounter is the moment of dawning comprehension from the players, as they begin to realize what exactly they have just walked their characters into."

If the PCs are having overwhelming success against the mimic without discovering the core, it may use its {@skill Deception} to play dead and sink beneath the waves.

Within its \"halls\" are bizarre organs that appear as traps, animated suits of armor to assault intruders, and a confusing maze of corridors.

The magic at these creature's disposal is formidable. Each possesses enough firepower to level a small city, let alone a party of intrepid adventurers. They are also far more mobile than their lesser counterparts, teleporting vast distances in an instance in search of gullible prey. Everything about these creatures screams overkill to me. Their strength far outclasses their need to feed on a dozen or so humanoids a year. Theory: the mimic either enjoys inflicting suffering (unlikely) or can only receive meaningful sustenance from powerful \"food\"."

After all, it is we adventurers who dive head first into the dark corners of the world in search of glory and treasure. One doesn't fault the tiger for hunting the antelope - it is in its nature.

										"Each behemoth mimic is like a miniature dungeon. Due to their huge size and nature as a creature, object, and structure, running these encounters is no small task. One of the most exciting aspects of the behemoth mimics is their customizable nature. Each {@creature mimic|MM} possesses a trait that allows it to appear as an \"ordinary\" object or structure of a certain type, with specific sections included for the combat purposes. Beyond that, the layout and design of your behemoth mimic is something for you to create. You could make the interior of your mimic a dizzying maze, fill its section with loot, or even add minions that have made the mimic their home. A more detailed mimic makes the disguise more convincing to your players in the metagame, in addition to increasing the encounter's difficulty. Consider the merits of presenting your behemoth mimic in the form of a battle map to explore, rather than a creature to be fought (at least at first). The mark of a well-made behemoth mimic encounter is the moment of dawning comprehension from the players, as they begin to realize what exactly they have just walked their characters into."

Its otherworldly melodies possess disturbing magical properties that can lay low an entire adventuring party. A bird of paradise can only reproduce when nesting upon the heads of humanoids, preferably in a state induced by their magical melodies. This process produces a single offspring over the course of a year in a life cycle too bizarre to have been conceived naturally.

With this hunger comes a metabolism of epic proportions. Brown dragons can easily consume their weigh in food in a single day with room for more. The more a brown dragon eats, the larger it gets. Those that are able to feast with great regularity rapidly mature, circumventing a typical dragon's normally slow rate of growth. If the goal of the experimenting green was to create a universal menace that knows no allegiance, then it undoubtably succeeded, for brown dragons have been a horrific plague upon the world since the day they were first created.",

While they are motivated by food in the most extreme sense, I don't think it is possible to satisfy their hunger. At best one can delay or placate a menacing brown dragon with gifts of food, but it is a mistake to believe such a relationship can last.

Thankfully these creatures reproduce very infrequently, blossoming every 25 years into beautiful blood red flowers that resemble lilies. For a single season the gimpy does not produce its acidic secretions, allowing its flowers to be pollinated. At the end of the season the gympie produces small fruits that resemble cranberries, which are highly prized by viticulturists for the flavorful wines that can be brewed with the succulent fruits. When not in this relatively peaceful state, a gympie's presence is easily noticed by the lack of fauna and acid burns on inorganic material. These trees exist only to scald and kill anything that gets within their cloud of acidic death. The plant's mechanism for producing the acid is so efficient that it can persist for years without sunlight or water, and a gympie is so hardy that even a root cluster can regrow to full size in a matter of weeks."

						"Elemental archons are extraordinary beings that arise when the soul of a powerful mortal travels to one of the elemental planes by accident or lack of faith. Most souls sent to the elemental planes are lost and destroyed, but when a mortal of great ability passes to these planes, they become its master. The soul wraps itself in the elements, animating them under its control. This exertion of will is poorly received by the plane, and while such realms are hardly sentient, they have a natural negative reaction to authority. The soul is expelled, landing on another plane as an elemental archon. The spirit \"controlling\" each archon determines its motives and actions once it arrives: some seek battle as a means to die and travel to the proper afterlife, others pursue the same agenda as in life and track down old foes, while some simply roam the world, lost and confused.",

Fell-beyonders have existed since time immemorial, feeding on those who hold love and passion in their hearts. Some say the first gods gathered them from the void to shape the deep places of the earth so that terror would always lurk below the realms of mortals. Others prophesy that the fell-beyonders are meant to scatter the stars across the sky, filling the world above with a vast, all-consuming emptiness. The only thing that can be agreed upon is the fell-beyonders exist to remind mortals that between every moment of hope, happiness, or love is a vile shadow that threatens to reduce all there is to ash.",

Forsaken and abandoned, these creatures festered for millennia in a world devoid of all but the vilest emotions. Having discovered a pathway to the mortal realms through dreams, the fell-beyonders are now unleashed to feed upon the hopes and passions of all waking life.",

It is said these fell-beyonders are born from our nightmares, our darkest fears set loose upon the world. While this is merely a theory, I cannot deny that the foul presence and fearsome abilities of these creatures are eerily reminiscent of my darkest dreams. My research suggests the creatures hail from an abandoned world, wisely forgotten given the properties of its inhabitants. Additionally, once manifested these aberrations are but flesh and blood. I have witnessed a firsthand three varieties thus far and have received firsthand accounts of a more lethal, elusive fourth.

When using liches to challenge your players, we recommend that you not award them experience for defeating it unless its phylactery is destroyed. This prevents the lich from being an \"XP farm\" or causing other strange interactions with character advancement. Additionally, the challenge rating of the liches presented here does not factor in their ability to rejuvenate, as each encounter with the lich may vary wildly depending on the circumstances.

My hopes that this specimen was a freak of nature relative to other imperial dragons were quickly dashed. These creatures are massive for their age, adding to their already intimidating appearance. Violence dominates every aspect of their lives. Where normally I would seek out ecological data to better understand and avoid conflict with powerful creatures, I can only conclude that acquiring tactical information on how to slay one should be my primary focus."

They are insatiably curious about anything they have not encountered before, and in battle they treat a lack of information about enemies as a crippling weakness. However, once an imperial dragon is confident it understands an enemy, it unleashes overwhelming force. They are efficient, joyful killers, enjoying the thrill of battle to an almost psychotic degree. A young imperial dragon doing too well in a fight may even give its foes time to recover and regroup, just to make things more interesting.",

Tactically brilliant, the imperial dragon should always have an effective plan, employing terrain and magic to devastating effect. Enemies that severely injure the dragon are afforded an honorable death.",

										"{@b Easier Tactics} - Don't use all the Ensnare attacks on the branches' turn, delay using Paralyzing Doubt and Stomp from the core and roots, and make sure every section is attackign different characters. You can further decrease the difficulty by having the lynchwood move more slowly so it can't reach as many characters with its attacks.",

Their culture is defined by rigid meritocracy and a clearly defined but highly mobile caste system, with members of each caste marked by replacing their heads with those of animals.

The testimony of a group of adventurers who claim to have traveled back to and from the height of the Nartheneen civilization is hardly scholarly. With that clarified, the Nartheneen are nonetheless a fascinating and study in differing cultural norms and well worthy of consideration. Their meritocracy was relentless, and each caste believed itself to be the most essential to its society's function. Yet they bore no ill will toward the other castes, for they were all aware that the others felt as they did. It was this common feeling of utmost importance that paradoxically united them, allowing them to act with coordination toward common goals.",

When one finds a portal to the material plane (or to anywhere else), it bounds through, eager to find moments of great significance it can influence with fortunes good or bad. Ahd moar are usually alone, for few creatures can tolerate the sudden reversals that accompany them. This aversion does not stop an ahd moar from seeking out companionship, for who else is it supposed to use its fate-altering abilities upon? These fey prefer indirect dealings, observing their \"friends\" from afar and altering their fates on a whim. This habit comes not from malice, but from an obsessive and irresistible instinct. Compelling an ahd moar to behave in any manner contrary to this instinct is nearly impossible, as many who have sought eternal luck have learned to their great dismay."

The best way to protect oneself from an ashcaller's wrath is to make it happy, and ashcallers are only happy when they are forging new tools of destruction. With potent magic and millennia of experience, ashcallers can spend centuries in their titanic foundries, beating material into shape with their bare hands. The fruit of such a labor is always an artifact of astounding power, a reflection of the perfection ashcallers seek to bring about in the world. In rare cases, an ashcaller may deem a lesser creature worthy of wielding their creations, empowering those who share their misanthropic worldview. In conversation ashcallers are always dour and spiteful, never passing an opportunity to demean those beneath them (which is pretty much everyone).

It has a plethora of monk-like abilities, along with a ki pool which you will need to track over the course of an encounter. Unless the worldbreaker knows that this combat is the most significant one it is likely to face anytime soon, it will refrain from using its Infinity Punch steps until it is certain its foes are worthy. In the meantime, it will deliver punishing attacks that can take even the most robust barbarian down in a single round. Note the world breaker's obscene speed on its legs, along with damage on attacks that surpasses anything else found in this book. Many of the worldbreaker's attacks can hit every everything within a certain area of its primary target. This includes objects and structures, allowing a worldbreaker to literally punch through solid barriers and strike targets behind cover. Additionally, a critical hit from one of the worldbreaker's most powerful attacks is usually enough to one-shot a character, so be careful when attacking with advantage.

Even if the characters manage to avoid the worst of it, the very act of that attack going off is a catacylsm of epic proportions, the ramifications of which are a story all to itself. Next, focus fire all of the worldbreaker's attacks on a single target until it is disintegrated. The giant's speed should keep it away from pesky paladins and beefy barbarians while it obliterates squishy spellcasters. This encounter will be hilariously unfair, with the worldbreaker possessing a counter to almost every tactic the characters can throw at it. The giant's engagement range is almost always going to be greater than the players', so push that advantage as hard as possible.

It is the dream of every mortal warrior to be born to the afterlife in the arms of a valkyrie, a fate befitting only those who have acted unfailingly with honor and strength. Unconcerned with the affairs of the living, all valkyries are bound to secure the souls of worthy warriors for a prophesized apocalyptic battle. Only then will the legions of souls, transformed into einherjar, be unleashed: a tide of steel and blood containing the greatest fighters throughout history. Should any mortal interfere with the affairs of this sacred charge, they will find themselves tested in combat. Those who prove themselves worthy will be invented to join the eternal host and prepare for the coming apocalypse. Those who fail the trial of valkyries lack the strength and honor to be considered worthy, condemned to a lifetime of inadequacy in the eyes of the world's greatest warriors.",

								"When Zau Hek was felled by Amunrahx's claw, I thought our long career adventuring together was finally at an end. Her soul rested peacefully in death, and we made preparations to bury her with honors. Hundreds she had aided gathered at the funeral, to pay homage to the greatest warrior I have known. It was then the angelic figure descended from the skies, a ghostly woman from a mysterious realm, battle ready and imperious in her demeaner. Alighting upon my friend's body, the valkyrie drew forth a drinking horn while speaking words none could hear. With ceremonial grace, the drink was poured down the fallen champion's throat, causing her to leap to her feet as lively as the day we first met. To this day she refused to tell me what the valkyrie said, on top of refusing to reimburse us for the funeral expenses. I must find my own way to call one of these celestials for further research, as I don't think Zau Hek has any intention of dying again."

Consider the merits of portraying a valkyrie in a way that honors this cultural history and think carefully about using valkyries in a way that would deviate from this portrayal.",

Vermindrakes are apex predators that dominate their environment, furiously annihilating anything artificial or humanoid that comes into their territory. Having long outlived their creator, vermindrakes are now a scourge on the world, hated by all sentient creatures but far too powerful and prolific to effectively exterminate.",

Instead of the drakopede filling a square like other creatures, use a 10-foot-by-10-foot square to represent the drakopede's head, and then attach a string or thick piece of rope approximately 190 in-game feet to that space, to be dragged behind it whenever the drakopede moves. This is the drakopede's body, which should cleanly snake behind that creature, making for an awesome mechanic that your players are unlikely to forget.

At first a mere curiosity, millennia of abundant magic use has strengthened it, matured it, and given it a mind all its own.

Pulsing like a dark heart, the void seeks to eat magic, birthing and shaping creations to feed its dark hunger.",

More than a few archmages have been consumed by a survivor of their most powerful spells, the creature endowed with mysterious powers from an unknown source.",

All magic, whatever the source, draws power from the weave. It leaves behind a gap, a void, which diminishes as the weave naturally restores itself. In the past, this was hardly a matter of concern, for few could use enough magic to create more than a pinprick void in the weave. But in this age of arcane abundance, our over-reliance of spells is creating something dangerous\u2014void pockets that do not shrink. Instead, they grow. They hunger. They think and scheme.

First, don't forget its core voidborn traits: Draining Aura and Void Resilience. When casting spells, remember the Voidcasting trait causes hit point loss, rather than damage, which allows the creature to bypass damage resistances and immunities.

Start using high-level spells first. {@spell Chain lightning} is a great choice if a party is clustered together. {@spell Feeblemind} works extremely well against characters with low Intelligence, typically barbarians and paladins, but can also shut down some Charisma- and Wisdom-based spellcasters. Once the null tide is concentrating on something, use {@spell cone of cold} for more damage or a higher-level spell slot to cast {@spell chain lightning} again. Use {@spell banishment} if one character in the party is dangerous and has low Charisma, or a high-level {@spell hold person} to immobilize multiple characters. {@spell Ice storm} and {@spell tidal wave|XGE} are good sources of extra damage if the null tide is already concentrating on a spell.",

War was not uncommon in those times, and during a particularly violent conflict, Xanaris stole into the closest village to steal an easy meal in the confusion. But the humans had discovered a new kind of fire. A cadre of mages sent a fusillade of fire and shadow, light and lightning, churning the snow and bodies into bloody mush. Xanaris, his body battered, and bones broken, crawled from the wreckage, sheer anger holding him conscious.",

Xanaris hunted down and slew every mage on the mountain, devouring their essence in a fruitless attempt to slake the unslakable. Xanaris then traveled far from the mountain on which he once lived, traversing much of the material plane and other realms pretending to be no more than a simple-minded beast."
