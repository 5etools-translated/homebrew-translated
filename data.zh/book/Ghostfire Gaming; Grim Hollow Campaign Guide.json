The first floor is occupied by the tavern's sprawling common room, a homely jumble of mismatched furniture and overstuffed armchairs that surround an impressive central hearth. A mounted head crowns the mantle. The upper floor of the tavern contains comfortable, simply appointed rooms for guests. A smaller attic space with a conical turret perches atop the second floor. Like the windows below, a warm amber glow radiates from behind this turret's frosted glass, backlighting a hulking figure that moves quickly out of sight.",

Inspection of the wall reveals that the vanishing door is not an illusion, and the characters are now trapped inside. The initial glamour of joviality and refuge is revealed to be a lure projected by the tavern as a means of enticing new prey. The true patrons slouch gloomily around tables, muttering in hushed tones."

The Dark Mist started to cover the region a few weeks before the first appearance of the Blood Knight. It hangs low over the lake and its surroundings most of the time, but sometimes there's a break and an area is momentarily free from the Dark Mist's oppressive presence. This in an important factor in the encounters, especially once characters understand that without the Dark Mist, any creature passing through it gets severely weakened or even {@condition incapacitated}. Feel free to use it to adjust the difficulty of the adventure for your players, for example by triggering a respite in the Dark Mist if the characters' are close to death. On the contrary, if they are finding gameplay too easy, the GM may use the Dark Mist to introduce additional creatures."

Those who stand to protect the character casting the spell have to place themselves between the monsters and the spellcaster and take damage in his place. They have to hold this way and survive three combat rounds, and each time the spellcaster takes a hit, that number of rounds is increased by one. Once the needed rounds are done, a loud shriek can be heard from the waters. The bones of Ser Hugues suddenly glow with a pale blue light, and the Blood Knight's shape begins to crumble, his very substance being sucked back into the bones. With a blazing explosion, it completely disappears, and the water elemental with it. When the characters' vision is restored, they find Ymdrin gasping for breath on the ground and kneeling in front of Daelron. The Bondmaker raises his hands and pronounces sentence, his voice being echoed by a deep, watery growl.",

						"Ymdrin's attempt to scream is interrupted as his body begins to bloat at a sickening rate. In a few seconds his skin and flesh tear and dissolve with a disgusting ripping sound, leaving only clean bones. Daelron gathers the bones and puts them in a bag before addressing the party.",
						"{@i \"You did well, and I thank you.\"} Daelron looks at the bag containing the bones. {@i \"He was one of my kind, and even his dark deeds should not deprive him from burial, for what comes from nature shall return to nature. The same goes for Ser Hugues, whose remains should rest in the peace of Sen Yaomil. I will see to it.\"}",

Inside, you will find the world of Etharis, a labour of love and passion made possible entirely by the support (and hard work) of gamers just like you.",

From a late-night gaming session to a successful Kickstarter campaign, the journey so far has been a whirlwind of challenging and rewarding experiences.",
						"This guide and the world of Etharis are our take on dark fantasy for a modern gaming table. In a time of flattened storytelling, where antagonists are hollow and heroes can never really fail, we sought to create something real and immersive. Inside we have included the tropes we love, the themes we find thought-provoking, and the storytelling techniques we find effective. We hope you enjoy them and come to share our passion for this world.",
						"This is our first book and we have learned a lot. We are incredibly proud of the work we have done, and the results laid before you. However, this is just the beginning for this hopeful little startup from Down Under, and we would be sincerely grateful to continue this journey with you. Now, as a part of our ever-growing community, we hope to see you next time, for whatever fantastical plane of existence our imaginations conjure next.",
						"With that, we are incredibly excited to share our creation with you. We hope you are just as excited to read it. So, from one eager nerd to another, happy gaming!",

The people of all these lands have adapted to a hostile environment. Punishing storms are frequent across the land, foreshadowed by howling winds and then drenching rain.

It was their adaptable nature and adventurous mindset that quickly led them to expand beyond their homelands. By the time the great kingdoms of the elves and the mighty thanedoms of the dwarves realized the violence that inevitably follows the humans, it was already too late. The eyes of the human leaders fell greedily on the prosperous lands of the elves and dwarves. The great Era of Expansion, also known as the Great Purge, had begun and humans were here to stay. Different tribal armies marched simultaneously north, south and west; no land was safe.

Having exterminated all the other kingdoms, the warlords turned against each other, each claiming the High Throne that would later become the Imperial Throne of Altenheim. This second Great Era, known as the Era of Descent, lost even more lives to its endless carnage. The result was the disintegration of the human race into fractious kingdoms. The Second Era considerably weakened the kingdoms of the humans, allowing the other races to emerge from hiding and re-establish some principalities in the lands they once ruled.",

Even though their bows were precise, they were outnumbered and unable to defend themselves on all fronts as war-hungry armies burned their sheltering forests. The elves lived for decades as nomads, trying to hide in the few remaining forests on the outskirts of the human civilization. However, their sorrow and grief for the lost beauty of their home empowered them to recreate it. They turned to the arts.

There, nomadic tribes of humans, half-orcs, and giants roam the northern wastelands. The unforgiving climate seems to suit half-orcs and encourage humans to accept them for their hardiness. The other field where a half-orc can thrive is war. Half-orcs are often found among the raiding parties of the Valikan clans.",
															"Outside of Valika, half-orcs are a rare sight, but they can be found across the various cities of the continent. The stereotypes involving their ancestors, combined with their intimidating appearance, strike fear among the other races, so that half-orcs are rarely accepted or trusted despite their capabilities. Warriors of other races often prefer to mock what they fear, all the while hoping they will never have to face an angry half-orc on equal terms."

										"Half-elves are among the later races to walk the land of Etharis. Before the Era of Expansion, humans and elves occasionally crossed paths. Some humans could appreciate the beautiful songs and poems of the elves, as the elves could appreciate the adventurous side of humanity. The results of these bonds were the ever-wandering half-elves. They are easily noticed by their less pronounced pointed elfin ears, combined with a bulkier but still elegant human frame. As with half-orcs, half-elves seem to have taken the best of their progenitors. Taller than the average man, elegant and graceful, they seem to possess the aptitude for the fine arts from their elven side along with the lust for adventure from their human side. What life could be better for them than the lives of wanderers, traveling artists, and merchants?",

In the midst of war, most elves could not understand how someone could fall in love with a savage, while few humans could forgive anyone who would mingle with the enemy. The first half-elves were cast out by both sides.",
															"Initially, the lifestyle of the wanderer suited them. Their talent in theater and music made wandering troupes of half-elves among the most famous to exist. Furthermore, half-elves could act as natural intermediaries between humans and elves. However, most half-elves keep the burdens of their souls well hidden. They learnt how to wear the mask of happiness, often dressing with bright colours and dazzling jewelry, accompanying their stylistic choices with an outwardly flamboyant, optimistic attitude. But if one is lucky enough to gain the trust of a half-elf, they will often see that the heart of a half-elf is full of sorrow. Wandering the continent is a lifestyle that fits them, but they can never call any place home. Considered outcasts by both humans and elves, they think themselves cursed, eternally strangers, with no hope of claiming any land as their own."

Though they lack wings, they are strongly built and stout with colours resembling those of their ancestors.",
										"Some claim that this race must be the most ancient among all races. In the Era of Expansion, they were settled in a small kingdom caught amidst the bloody conflicts between humans and elves. This conflict led to the destruction of the only place they truly belonged to, the city of Ember Cairn. However, this noble race managed to survive. Eons passed as the dragonborn prayed to the dragon gods to restore their kingdom, and the dragon gods did not answer. Wrath grew among the Dragonborn, as well as desperation. They stopped praying to their dragon lords and their religion, the Sacred Flame, was abandoned.",
										"The dragonborn, however, pious and spiritual by nature, needed something to believe in. A new religion was offered to them by Castinellan missionaries who were spreading the word of their new religion, that of the Divine Seraphs. Finding it close to the dragonborn ideals of virtue and determination, they quickly embraced the new religion and became its most zealous followers. Sharing the same beliefs with the humans of the Castinella Provinces, they were quickly incorporated to the empire, becoming subjects of the Castinellan theocracy.",
										"Castinella awarded the dragonborn a small region of their ancestral land to call their own. Dragonborn rebuilt the ancient city of Ember Cairn, a city made entirely of granite. Many dragonborn from across the continent flocked to the city and began to worship the Divine Seraphs. This city became a site of religious pilgrimage for dragonborn across the continent. With their ancient prayers finally answered, the dragonborn were drawn to the paths of clerics, missionaries, and inquisitors, to spread their new beliefs with burning passion and burning fire when necessary. The land of Etharis will hear the dragons roar once again."

Even though their inventions have a bad habit of blowing up, no one can stay mad at a gnome. Their cheerful attitude, curiosity, and humor puts the gnomes among the most likely to have a good feast or a carefree dance.",

Cannons, automatons, flintlocks, and explosives are all reputed to be results of gnomish brilliance. If you are looking for a gnome in a populated city, you just have to wait for the explosion to guide your steps.",
										"During the Era of Expansion, gnome settlements outside the shelter of mountains were annihilated by human warlords, forcing them to seek shelter in the neighboring dwarven city of Stehlenwald. There they shared the fate of their dwarven cousins as countless human armies besieged the tall stone walls of the city.",
										"The surviving gnomes pushed the dwarven thane to dig deeper, in a last attempt to find new metals or an escape route beneath the mountains.",
										"As the dwarves were gazing upon the newfound adamantine, the gnomes were staring at the other veins of the mountain, their ingenious minds hatching a plan to win the war.",
										"The gnomish alchemists worked day and night, mixing the gifts of the mountain until they invented a new weapon: explosives. As the dwarves charged in their impenetrable shining adamantine armours, they were backed up by the sound of explosions as the gnomes hurled cannonballs and dynamite at the enemy. The humans quickly scattered; the effects of the explosives had struck fear into their hearts. The battle was won but the losses for both gnomes and dwarves were great. The gnomish race followed the dwarves in the Stehlenwald kingdom into their centuries-long isolation. When the dwarven king voluntarily joined the Bürach empire, the gnomes followed. Today, with trade reaching all across the empire, the gnomes can lay hands on even more exotic and volatile materials, pushing (or blowing) their science to new heights each passing day."

While wielding a Guard weapon, whenever a hostile creature moves within your reach, and you did not move on your last turn, you can use a reaction to make a weapon attack with a Guard weapon against that creature. If the attack hits, then it deals no damage, the creature immediately stops and its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn.",

When you take the attack action and successfully hit a creature with a Scatter weapon, measure the weapon's Scatter range from the square (or point of impact) that the target you hit occupies. All creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon's scatter range must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Scatter DC.

The process of the ritual involves several despicable acts including murder, the brewing of a vile concoction, and even one's own death. However, it is the process of tearing one's soul from the body that is most despised, for this process involves the sacrifice of something truly dear to a mortal, and no substitute will be accepted. For some, it is the death of a cherished loved one. For others it is a family legacy. Regardless of the sacrifice, unless the Dreadscape spirits deem it worthy, Lichdom will not be granted."

Within Advanced Backgrounds, holdings are the assets, resources, or advantages a character gains through their position. Holdings vary between professions, from finding free lodging to acquiring a grand fortress and legions of soldiers, or anything in between. Within each profession are examples of the sorts of holdings a character might achieve as they progress through the professional ranks. Whenever a character advances in rank, they retain their holdings from previous ranks.",

From making a medical breakthrough to being appointed by a monarch, progressions vary depending on the rank and profession they belong to. Progressions make great character goals and can be tied into existing character or party goals. For example, a scribe looking to disprove falsehoods could do so by pursuing the mystery at the heart of the campaign's overall story.",

Ultimately it is up to the GM to determine how the characters within your setting progress, and what holdings are necessary to the gameplay. Additionally, a GM may decide to allow a character to progress within their profession due to alternative reasons, such as circumstantial gameplay, setting requirements, or for any other reason. Players and GMs should discuss what sort of holdings a player could expect to receive at each rank and what progression paths may be available to them."

Over the years, some of these tribes grew in size and stature, and either conquered or absorbed other tribes. Thus, they became the Bürach, which in the olden tongue means \"One Above All\".",

												"The Empire follows a caste system, with the royalty at the top, followed by the nobility, the knights, the merchants, the craftsmen, and then finally, the serfs. Their society is structured around fealty to a particular noble family. Each province must abide by the rules of their lords and common born serfs may not leave the land of their birth without permission.",
												"Those caught abandoning their lords, either by running away or breaking their laws, are dealt with severely.",
												"Though a single empire, the Bürach is not homogeneous. Four distinct groups of people gathered into provinces, with each devoted to their own particular god, and those divisions have survived even if the gods have not.",
												"The Abendfolk are devotees of Aurelia, goddess of healing and protection. Their city of Altenheim forms the cultural and economic heart of the Bürach Empire.",

												"As these provinces grew in power, foreign kingdoms soon challenged them, coveting their lands. The people turned to the gods for aid. The Four Divines agreed that the burgeoning Empire needed a central figure around which they could rally. Appearing to each of their priests, the Four advised the Bürach to form an empire.",
												"The priests, known as the Hearthkeepers of Aurelia, searched far and wide for signs of one who would be the emperor.",
												"Though they met many a knight, noble, and mage, none was deemed fit for the title.",
												"Then their visions led them to the western marches. Here they found a 12-year-old boy named Thancred, who had single-handedly slain a giant that guarded a fjord so that he could build a bridge between two towns. When the Hearthkeepers came before him, they watched as he returned a dead lamb back to life with just his hands. As one, the priests fell to their knees and named him Emperor Indorius, first of his line.",
												"As a gift to the new emperor, the four gods poured their divinity into four sacred artifacts: a crown that radiated authority (Galt), a sword that increased his might (Maligant), an orb that gave him far sight (Ulmyr), and a breastplate that protected him from harm (Aurelia).",
												"With these treasures and the support of his people, the emperor launched a campaign against his nation's rivals. With sword and banner, he led the combined army of the four provinces into war. Victory after victory followed him until the surrounding nations were conquered and folded into Bürach. This created an empire that stretched from one end of the continent to the other, the largest nation in all of Etharis.",
												"With his empire secured, Emperor Indorius implemented ambitious changes throughout the land. He standardised trade and created guilds for building infrastructure. By establishing coastal settlements, he freed the Bürach from centuries as a land-locked people. A patron of the arts, he encouraged bards and musicians to flourish in his court. When Emperor Indorius finally entered the afterlife, the Empire had become a nation of wealth and enlightenment.",
												"This greatness would not last. The gods who had answered the Bürach's prayers were themselves the survivors of a disastrous war. Only time would reveal the wounds they had suffered fighting enemies beyond even divine comprehension. Surely the gods' minds were already tainted when they chose Indorius, for the seeds of empire they planted were the seeds of their own madness and destruction."

												"So great was the impact of Indorius's rule that the Bürach instituted what would be known as the Edict of Eternal Blood. According to this law, only one of the emperor's direct descendants could be raised to the throne.",
												"The Hearthkeepers took great care to preserve the purity of the imperial family. Cousins and sometimes siblings were led to marry in order to maintain the Edict. However, many voices across the Bürach warned against such acts, but their words fell on deaf ears. Encouraged by the priesthood, the people's faith in the Imperial family kept the government in power, and for centuries all was right in the world.",
												"That changed with Emperor Leopold I.",
												"From a young age, it was clear that Leopold was truly, irrevocably mad. He often spoke to things that weren't there and treated people like they were insects, having servants imprisoned and flayed for the smallest infractions. Officials whispered among themselves that they could not in good conscience put him into power, but to disobey the Edict was to invite disaster for the government. Thus, one summer solstice, Leopold was crowned Emperor of the Bürach.",
												"Possessed by religious fervour, Leopold exhorted the masses to believe that only one of the four gods should rule supreme. Why should they each follow four, when only one--the greatest, most powerful of all--was deserving of their devotion?",
												"Each sect then began to argue that their god should be the One True Deity.",
												"Leopold's madness seeped into the four artifacts he wore. Worse, as these artifacts carried the essences of the four gods, his madness fed back into their minds, driving them insane.",
												"The Four Divines turned on each other, each believing they should be the One True God. The gods warred in the heavens, causing calamities such as storms, flash fires, and earthquakes. Their hostility quickly spread to their worshippers. Within a year, the Bürach Empire had descended into civil war as the four provinces fought among themselves.",
												"To end the violence, individuals from the four provinces conspired against the emperor. Their assassins swept into the imperial palace and killed Leopold. With his death, the sacred artifacts disappeared. This caused the Divine Aurelia to come out of her insanity long enough to see that the gods' battles would soon destroy all of Etharis. She then used all her power to shield the land from the gods' war. In so doing, she gave up her own life. In time the other three\u2014Maligant, Ulmyr, and Galt\u2014slew each other.",
												"The death of the Four Divines sent a shockwave of magic throughout the Empire. Divine magic still exists, but is now believed to radiate from the remaining Arch Seraphs and Daemons, not from the dead gods themselves.",
												"The leaders of each province called for a ceasefire, and each army retreated to their land to heal and recover from their losses. A new emperor, Aratron I, was installed and provided counterfeit sacred artifacts to shore up the people's faith. This emperor served only as a figurehead; the Hearthkeeper ministers of Aurelia were now the real power behind the throne."

It corrupts that which it touches. It whispers into the hearts of men and turns them to wickedness.",
												"Soon, aberrations and abominations started appearing throughout the provinces. Discord and corruption seeped through every fibre of society.",

In Abendland, mobs of zombie-like creatures, their flesh fused together into a cancerous, many-limbed blob, attack wayfarers and peasants. In Rauland, puppet-like creatures strangle and dismember innocent folk with razor-sharp strings. Nordenland is plagued by corrupted flora and fauna, including treants with human heads and limbs instead of branches. Finally, Unterland has reported sightings of corrupted warriors, their armour melted into their flesh, roaming the countryside and killing indiscriminately.",

														"Since time immemorial, Abendland had been ruled by the Holy Church of the Hearthkeepers, clerics of the goddess Aurelia. According to legend, Aurelia herself led the first of her priests, Amara, to the western plains in order to escape the tyrannical ruler of her former tribe. There, the goddess ordered Amara to strike the arid ground with her spear. From that spot emerged a spring of crystal clear water. The spring became the sacred lake, Osea, which fed the land and the city of Altenheim, until it turned verdant and green.",
														"Abendland's open plains, situated in the clearings between dense forest, facilitated farmlands and plantations, feeding its growing population. The Hearthkeepers encouraged and spread the worship of Aurelia, promising peace and prosperity to all who followed her. And many did. Abendland consequently became known as the land of clerics and paladins, and Altenheim gained the title of \"The City of Joy\".",
														"When Emperor Indorious was crowned, the Hearthkeepers welcomed him with open arms. He was the only son of Aurelia, they said, the promise of the goddess made flesh. They threw all their power and resources into supporting his rule, and taught the Abendfolk from youth to revere the Emperor. Thus, the Imperial family and the Hearthkeeper religion became tied together forever as a political body. For centuries, the clerics have legitimised the rule of each Emperor, and used their influence to keep his bloodline pure.",
														"The coming of Leopold I brought an end to this golden age. His madness seeped into Aurelia's holy artifact, the Hearthfire Breastplate, and reached the mind of the goddess herself.",
														"Aurelia became jealous of her people's devotion. She demanded adoration, prayers, tributes, a lifetime of servitude from her followers, all while fawning over Leopold. In the end, she even demanded blood sacrifices. All of this was an effort to show she was the one true god, the most deserving of worship. As for her priests, they willingly followed her whims and those of the emperor. They had lived too long in the comfort of authority to give it up.",
														"Finally, Aurelia went to war with the other three gods. Thus distracted, she did not see when one of her priestesses, Talana, turned on her.",
														"Conspiring with like-minded individuals from the other three provinces, Talana opened the way for the assassins to infiltrate the Imperial Palace. It worked, and with Leopold dead, the assassins seized control of the artifacts. Galt, Maligant, and Ulmyr remained mad, but Aurelia\u2014perhaps because she was the goddess of protection\u2014managed to break out of her insanity.",
														"Seeing the devastation caused by the war, she used all her power to protect her people from the Gods' End. The sacrifice consumed all that was left of her power. Aurelia plunged to Etharis, lifeless.",
														"After the Gods' End, Altenheim did its best to rebuild. The Church of the Hearthkeepers installed a new emperor, replaced the missing artifacts with fakes, and led the people to continue their veneration. But to their horror, the priests found that their clerical abilities were slowly fading as the remnant of Aurelia's power waned from the world. Thus, they withdrew from the public and spread myths among the people: that Aurelia was not dead but merely sleeping, that she would rise again to restore her people to the glory of the Empire's early days.",
														"Soon the concept of \"protection\" took on a different meaning in the City of Joy. The citizens had to be protected from the corruption of the outside world. They had to be brought closer to the light of Aurelia's hearth. They need to be sheltered from the harsh realities of the Gods' End. Dissent among the populace was dealt with harshly. Any talk of a horned shadow monster roaming the lands was silenced."

The Quartz Palace at the topmost level of Stehlenwald remains one of the wonders of the Bürach Empire.",

The forge fires of Stehlenwald burned for centuries as the Raufolk created great buildings and fashioned weapons for trade with the other provinces.",
														"When madness fell upon Galt, he demanded nothing less than complete order. In taskmaster fashion, he commanded that everything run on time, for products to be made and sold like clockwork. Buildings continued to rise, weapons were forged by the thousands and shipped across the land, and the people worked like slaves. No one was allowed to rise above their station or to leave the province.",
														"As Galt's paranoia worsened, he began to police the minds of his followers.",
														"The watchmen patrolled the streets and monitored the city from watchtowers. Those that ever voiced a whisper of dissent were imprisoned\u2014sometimes put to death.",
														"Unable to stand this madness any longer, a handful of Raulish sages made a pact with the other provinces. The Raulfolk secretly forged daggers that would be undetectable to the seers of the Imperial Palace. Thus, assassins were able to steal into the imperial palace and kill Emperor Leopold.",
														"Though they were freed from their mad god, life only marginally improved for the Raulfolk. Their wares remain popular throughout the Empire, but without Galt's guidance their craft began to decline in potency over the years. Border disputes with Unterland arose, and their need for timber led to conflict with nearby Nordenland.",

														"Unterland began as its own city-state long before the other provinces had united under one banner.",
														"Once a weak tribe of hunters living among the marshlands, the Unter people had the misfortune of being surrounded by hostile tribes. With their best soldiers lost to countless skirmishes, the Unterfolk raised their prayers and offerings the heavens and begged for salvation. It was the god Maligant who answered them.",
														"Maligant proved to be a god of strategy and intelligent warfare. Under his tutelage, the Unters selected adapt generals to lead their troops. They learned to forge strong alliances and dissolve them when they were no longer useful. They also learned to win with surgical precision instead of relying on brute force, and to break the enemy's spirit as well as their armies.",
														"Their greatest conflict was undoubtedly the Etienne War, when the Vorkan tribe marched across the border to try and take their lands. However, the Vorkan made the mistake of invading during the wet season. While the Vorkans camped beside a river, the Unterfolk released the water from their dam to flood the banks. More than half the invaders drowned, and the rest were forced to retreat. Thus, the Unterfolk won the Etienne war without losing a single soldier.",
														"Soon after, the allied Unter tribes consolidated under one territory: Unterland. They founded their capital of Olstenburg, where rose their most important institution: The Academy of Swords, where the citizenry could learn the military sciences. Every able-bodied youth was sent to the Academy for two years of training and military service.",
														"Thus, Unterland managed to grow a trained citizen army that they could field at a moment's notice.",
														"Like the other provinces, Unterland joined under one empire when Indorious I came into power. They served a critical function: to defend the nation and expand its borders. In battle, the Unterfolk fielded their heavy cavalry, and infantry composed of pikemen, swordsmen, crossbowmen. When needed, they also employed their hunters to wage guerrilla warfare in forested regions. Theirs was a fighting force without compare.",
														"However, there were some in Unterland who refused to follow the Empire, seeing it as a form of imprisonment. They left Unterland, crossing the Grey Spine into a new land that they called Ostoya. Their secession would plant the seeds of bitter conflict.",
														"The Unterfolk sage who joined in the assassination of Emperor Leopold was named Dmitri Speir, a retired general who formulated the plan and led its execution. Once the deed was done, he wrote a signed confession before committing suicide with his own sword. The Hearthkeepers named him a traitor, but defying their edict, Speir's countrymen buried him with full honours.",
														"Of all the provinces, it was Unterland that suffered most after the Gods' End. With the chaos that came from the death of the Four Divines, soldiers were needed more than ever to protect the Empire from both internal and external threats. This led to a diaspora that saw thousands of men leaving to fight wars or keep the peace elsewhere.",
														"First and paramount among the Unters attention was the new nation across the Grey Spine. Under the Empire's orders and with the pretext of disciplining erring citizens, they invaded Ostoya and set up outposts there. Unfortunately, their initial momentum did not last; eventually, Ostoya counter-attacked with armies of the living dead, pushing the Empire back behind the Grey Spine. Knowing that to lose here would mean losing face throughout Etharis, the Bürach did not relent. The years would see a long war of attrition that would weaken both sides.",

In its pure state, it remains at a temperature just above freezing, and can only be heated or frozen using magic. When used in place of other water it also greatly increases the yield of farm crops and the potency of potions. These properties have made the aristocrats and landowners of Gräffendam some of the wealthiest in the Empire. The upper classes take their social status literally, residing on the domed roof of the dam.",
														"Called Gildreath, the aristocracy have constructed a perpetual winter wonderland. Gildreath teems with villas and evergreen gardens draped in magical lights. The privileged few who dwell atop Gräffendam spend their lives indulging in excess and frivolity. The same cannot be said for the desperate masses that live at the base of the dam. The base of Gräffendam is a hive of crime and poverty. When the rumours of plague came, the aristocracy prevented entry to the upper dam by all but the wealthiest. With nowhere else to turn, the growing population of refugees established a vast ghetto of rickety high-rises sloping up the outer wall of the dam. Below these favelas lies the river port of Ünterdam, which has fallen into disrepair since the plague and reduced trade to a near standstill. Due to the limited hours of daylight from the shadow of the dam, the area of Ünterdam and the favela are collectively called \"The Shade\".",
														"Shortly after Gräffendam was closed to the public, the upper class struck a deal with the Ebon Syndicate. The Syndicate would get a cut of the shipping revenue and control over The Shade, so long as they prevented intruders breaching the dam walls and quashed civil unrest. With unchecked authority over the base of the dam, the Syndicate are free to conduct whatever business they wish.",

They founded the town of Nov Ostoya and raised a keep by the restless sea.",
														"In time, Nov Ostoya became a hub for sea trading, fishing, and whaling. Lumberyards were erected at the nearby forests. As the roads lengthened and grew more developed, wealth began to flow into the town, which soon turned into a dense city filled with ornate towers and brooding sculptures. Nov Ostoya came to be known as the City of Gargoyles.",
														"When the Bürach Empire invaded Ostoya, Soma was at the front lines of the war. While wealthy, their army was not as experienced as the Empire's seasoned soldiers, and they lost more battles than they won. The Bürach's encroachment into the province grew with each passing season, before retreating for the winter.",
														"Matters worsened when the Darkfall led to widespread destruction. The inciting earthquake unearthed an ancient metropolis that the Somans had unwittingly built over. The City Below gave up its dead: hordes of zombies, wights, ghouls, and vampires emerged from the abyss to ravage the countryside.",
														"Without drastic measures, it was clear that Ostoya would fall to this new threat. The nobility came up with a plan: they ordered a young Soman captain named Morgen Hund and his company to fight their way into the largest chasm and hold back the tide of undead.",

														"But this was not the last they saw of Morgen Hund.",
														"The Ostoyan captain had survived the collapse. He wandered deep in the underground city to escape the undead horde. During his travels, he found himself in a strange shrine dedicated to a forgotten god. The shrine spoke to him, offering him his fondest desire in exchange for his servitude.

From the near extinction of the gnomes to the destruction of the dragonborn's homeland, humanity had fallen far from the virtues of honour and justice. King Aymeric remarked that if they continue this war, they would be no different from the other human tribes of Etharis. With much work and every kind of diplomacy, Aymeric Noblecoeur at last convinced the other warlords to end the war, unify the tribes as one kingdom, and share the responsibilities of the land with the elves through the Pact of the Sacred Land.

They enacted a ritual that would use the Mist to convey their enchantments across the Kingdom, defiling the very roots of the land and creating an opening for sorcerers to take control of spirits. The Dark Elves' leaders intended to bind the Spirits of Nature against their will to fight in the war to retake all of Caer Neiada. However, to accomplish such a task, they needed to sacrifice a pure heart. They seized the opportunity when the new king, Thibault de Sauveterre, came to Tol Leyemil to offer his daughter, Princess Tiphaine de Sauveterre, in keeping with the pact. A group of Dark Elves, disguised as the princess' official escort from Tol Leyemil, kidnapped the princess. They did indeed bring her to the Temple of Mists, but once there, Dark Elf sorcerers began their ritual with the princess at its nexus. Soon a dark mist appeared above the temple and alarmed the city of Tol Leyemil. By then it was too late to stop the ritual. Everything would have worked according to Diyanthar's plans, had not a valiant knight intervened.",

But what made him truly renowned was his honorable yet unsatisfied love for Princess Tiphaine. Despite the Pact of Sacred Land, he asked for her hand and begged her royal father not to send her to the Temple of Mist. The princess was said to secretly return Guilhem's love, but neither would dare to go against the word of King Thibault. The king was deeply saddened by the situation as he felt in his heart that their love was true. But as king, he could not abandon the ancient pact, for fear of the consequences.",
												"When Ser Guilhem heard the king's decree, he swore an oath to never love another than Princess Tiphaine and to live a life of a knight errant. But a short time after he left, the spirits with whom he had taken an oath contacted him to warn him that the princess was in grave danger.",
												"He made haste to Tol Leyemil and found the group of Dark Elves sailing towards the Temple of Mists with her. He followed them and, thanks to his renewed magical powers, managed to reach the temple shortly after the ritual started. Gathering all his courage, he fought his way through the Dark Elf escort and managed to strike a blow to Diyanthar. The ritual was interrupted, but both Guilhem and Diyanthar were caught, alongside Princess Tiphaine, in a magical explosion when the ritual collapsed.",
												"Of the ten elven shamans who were sent to the Temple of Mists to find out what happened, only the Grand Shaman Aethorion returned. He did not bring good news. The ritual had indeed been interrupted, but its effects had not been completely prevented, and from that day forth the Mist was unstable. Sometimes grey as it had ever been, it can also take on a dark taint which proves extremely dangerous; wherever it appears, it throws the Spirits of Nature into turmoil, making their manifestations far more dangerous. Dark tales of villages slaughtered by monstrous creatures led by Dark Elf sorcerers and bewitched dark knights began to spread in the land.",
												"The Dark Elves and their allies fled from Tol Leyemil and headed to the dead city of Tol Kerdywel, hiding their movements with the Dark Mist. It is said that by doing so, they were following Diyanthar's last orders. No one apart from them knows what these orders were, but knowing their destination is enough to raise grave concerns\u2014Tol Kerdywel is known to be the place where a lich princess lies, vanquished and banished ages ago by the elves of old.",
												"There is no certainty about the fate of Princess Tiphaine and Ser Guilhem, but both have apparently been seen as apparitions in the Mists, calling for help to lift their curse. As for Diyanthar, he also seems to be trapped in the Mist, as no trace of him could be found anywhere in the Kingdom. But that does not mean he has become harmless, as each time he is seen in the mist, dark creatures appear shortly after..."

Her royal lineage, her thirst for power, and her deep cunning drove her to push even further. She conceived an immeasurably powerful spell, the Web of Ascendancy, that aimed not simply to control parts of nature or particular Spirits, but the entire land itself. She cast the spell from her castle of Tol Kerdywel, granting herself almost godlike powers: she could change the very form of the land or control any living creature in the region of Tol Kerdywel.",
														"Only the alliance of several elven kingdoms from across the world was enough to counter the threat Thaelkinei posed, and the gathered elven sorcerers managed to create a counterspell. Even then, they could not completely overcome Thaelkinei's spell, so instead were forced to use another even more powerful forbidden spell: the Curse of Unchanging, a powerful magical web that engulfed the area of Tol Kerdywel and bound every living thing inside in a magical sleep. It was as if time had stopped entirely, for the people, the flora, and the fauna. This terrible spell still holds in Tol Kerdywel, and despite the danger, the region's supposedly unguarded wealth has attracted the boldest adventurers.",

														"{@b {@i The Temple of the Mists}} - At the south of the Charneault Kingdom lies the source of the Mists that regularly cover the land. The heart of the region is occupied by an ancient volcano, and the Temple of the Mists itself lies in what remains of its caldera, worn down by eons of erosion.",
														"Although the crater still dominates the landscape, it is often hidden, at least in part, by the Mists. The intricate network of rivers, lakes and other streams that abound all around the volcano make it even harder to find one's way to the temple.",
														"Therefore it is no surprise that no one foolish enough to attempt to reach the temple without invitation ever returns. Many in the Charneault Kingdom say that those who ventured to the temple were bewitched by malevolent Spirits, while others say that they actually found the temple, but are imprisoned there forevermore.",
														"The only people capable of locating the Temple of Mists without guidance are the elven shamans that regularly perform rituals there.",
														"They are bound to silence and will not willingly share the way to the temple. As yet no one has tried to force them, as they are powerful sorcerers.",
														"A ceremony is regularly held in the temple to release the Mists. Many tales and stories speak of what the ceremony entails, and why the Mists are released on the Kingdom, but the truth is known only to the highest elven authorities and they will not share the secret. All they revealed when the Pact of Sacred Land was made was that the Mists must be released from the temple or the entire region would surely be thrown into darkness.",
														"{@b {@i Tol Kerdywel}} - The western part of the Charneault Kingdom is a place even more dangerous than the Temple of Mists. Indeed it is a wicked land where the trees have no leaves and the waters are dark as night. This cursed land is dominated by the dead city of Tol Kerdywel, where Thaelkinei, the Lich Princess, lies dormant.",
														"{@b {@i Dark Oak Grove}} - A halfling caretaker and her many companions once tended a wondrous forest of towering black oak trees on the outskirts of Tol Kerdywel. In her capable hands the grove flourished, and travelers from across the kingdom came to admire the wild sanctuary of rare and beautiful flora and fauna. In her spare time, the halfling took in sick and injured animals and nursed them back to health, maintained the underground springs, and tended to the trees, who she maintained whispered secrets of old to her.",
														"However, travellers today will find no such splendour. The grove has become a place of death and decay. Its once-magnificent oaks have rotted from the inside out, spotted with mushrooms and furred tendrils.",
														"The burbling springs that used to flow abundantly have turned to stagnant mires filled with quicksand and waterborne insects. The scent of wildflowers and pine has turned to rotting wood and the decaying corpses of half-eaten creatures. The animals of the grove in the time of the halfling fled shortly after her disappearance, and those that stayed became prey for the new predators who took up residence. Those who have attempted to cultivate the grove and restore its former beauty find that introduced species are eaten or perish from disease, plants wither and die from the now-salty soil, and the water is brackish and undrinkable.",
														"Some say a terrible bargain was negotiated in order for such a foul place to persist, while others maintain that the grove is an extension of Tol Kerdywel. One thing is certain though: those who venture into Dark Oak Grove return permanently altered, as if the decay and stagnation have settled into their very being. They are plagued with dreams of death and cruelty, and often experience vivid hallucinations of being a walking corpse. Regardless of their destination, wise travellers avoid the grove at all costs.",
														"{@b {@i The Shaded Haven}} - Settled by Kainen Alabaster, the Shaded Haven is a small lakeside village that serves as a sanctuary to many lycanthropes who have recently turned. The settlement boasts thriving fishing and agriculture, but export is limited to the neighbouring towns and villages within the Charneault Kingdom. Physicians can access the village's herb depository for medicinal ingredients, and use the crafting facilities there to make various elixirs and remedies. Some of the herbs grown in the depository are particularly rare and potent, and care must be exercised when mixing them. The depository's seer, Grechia, tends to the plants and is able to source cuttings of rare herbs for a small fee. Lycanthropes researching a cure for their curse frequently pillage the depository, much to the annoyance of Grechia and the village's physicians."

Some leaders he convinced through diplomacy, others through acts of service. With his mortal enemy, the Sarvif of the Sýr Clan, he fought a duel to the death that lasted three days and nights. With that victory, all six clans united under Thorgard's banner, their swords and axes sharpened, and their longships lining each harbor.",

A great battle was fought in the tundra, and within a season, the foreigners were driven south, their colonies abandoned. The North was free once more.",

However, Rune discovered that Ixlalu's magic staff was the true source of his power. She stole it from his vault and used it to curse their entire island, turning it into a prison that would hold them captive for thousands of years.",
														"Of late, Rune's curse appears to be weakening. Fire elementals have been seen testing the boundaries of the island, searching for a way out.",

														"Volgen is a jagged peninsular that is said to be the resting place of Gormadraug's heart.",

From there, he preyed on the local populace and traveling merchants, sacrificing hundreds of innocents to otherworldly beings in his bid for power. Eventually, he was overthrown by heroes.

														"Fort Kentigern - At the edge of the ice bridge that links Volgen to the mainland is the fortress of the Order of Kentigern. What once was a monastery is now a high keep built to withstand a siege, with tall towers and parapets equipped with burning oil. But these defenses were not built against any mortal siege. Indeed, no army has dared to attack the fort in hundreds of years.",
														"Rather, the Order of Kentigern is Grarjord's first line of defense against the encroaching coldfire menace from Volgen. The ten-foot thick walls of the fortress hide catapults and trebuchets that can fire burning pitch. Ice drakes carrying bombardiers can take off in moments at the first sign of blue flame. Evoker mages can hurl fireballs from the topmost ramparts.",

Therefore, none of the belligerents managed to overcome their counterparts for good until the time of Montego Valieda, the Unifier.",

Whether by destiny or luck, Valieda was spared from the storms and came back, claiming to have had a revelation from the Arch Seraph Empyreus. The Sword Saint, as many called Empyreus, had apparently invested Valieda with the holy task of unifying all Castinellan Provinces, not under the rule of Corova or any other province, but under the sacred rules of the Arch Seraph himself. To help in this task, Valieda claimed, the Seraph had led him to a hidden valley where he revealed an exceptional vein of gold. Valieda quickly hired miners to exploit the vein and thus fuel Corova's economy and war effort.",
												"Valieda proclaimed his new allegiance to Empyreus and his intention of transforming Castinella into a theocracy, to put an end to the exhausting wars between the three provinces. His words became a motto that is still spoken by many clerics, priests and inquisitors:",

												"But he who fights for Empyreus fears nothing, for his steps are led by the Eternal Dogma, and his deeds pave the way towards the Golden Age.\"",
												"Valieda and his followers proceeded to spread the teachings of the Arch Seraph to the three provinces. In time they gained complete theocratic influence over the provinces of Faro and Therpena, as their newly formed religion gained more war-weary followers. Finally, when they were unable to rally the last remnants of resistance to the holy cause, they overcame them either by gold or by iron and fire."

The Inquisitors were eager to find these people at the youngest possible age, as they claimed the threat of magic could be more easily contained in the young whose magical abilities had not fully emerged.",
												"Sagrado Valieda later returned to the land of the Shattered Peaks among the Dragonborn. As missionaries of the Arch Seraph Empyreus spread their teachings across Etharis, some Dragonborn migrated back to the Castinellan Provinces. After centuries of wandering and resentment from the abandonment of their dragon gods, the scattered Dragonborn people had left behind their ancestral religion. Hence, they showed little hesitation to take hold of the new light that Empyreus offered. Seeing this, Sagrado Valieda seized the opportunity to strengthen Castinella and the Empyreus theocracy even more. He announced that all Dragonborn were welcome to reconstruct their former city of Ember Cairn, fallen eons ago, as long as they were raising it to the glory of Empyreus. As the Dragonborn were now the most zealous followers of the Divine Seraph, Valieda made Ember Cairn the headquarters of his newly created Arcanist Inquisition and raised the Cathedral of Embers."

After a few decades of unsuccessful intrigues and power struggles, the Castinellans took up arms and launched a surprise attack on Morencia. By suborning a member of the Morencian Navigators Guild, the Castinellan fleet was able to pass through the island-city's magical barrier, the Misty Reefs. However, the intervention of the Charneault Kingdom ruined the Castinellan plans, and though they inflicted heavy losses to the Morencian fleet, they finally lost the naval battle.",

At this point, the ship had completely run out of supplies, but the crew had finally repaired the ship enough to control its course, and headed to the northwest in hope of finding land before they starved. But they made a surprising discovery during their approach to the coast: the submerged ruins of what seemed to be a vast complex. Unable to explore the ruins at the time, the captain noted enough information to find the ruins again in the future. Yet at that moment Castinellan society was turned towards the future, and the clergy proclaimed the ruins nothing more than more proof of mistakes made in the past.",
												"Some time later, however, rumours spread within Castinella that the Thaumaturge, a powerful confederation of archmages, had infiltrated the Castinellan Provinces and was about to take action against the theocracy. It is unknown if the rumours had anything to do with the discovery of the ruins, or with the Castinellan Provinces' provocative attack on Morencia, but the rumours spread all over the provinces, accusing the magic hating theocracy of a hidden, hypocritical agenda. These rumours were officially denied and declared heretical, a brand that extended to anyone even repeating the rumours. The Arcanist Inquisition launched the Great Purge in the provinces, redoubling their efforts to find spellcasters and, this time, to burn them. The same terrible fate also awaits anyone caught calling the Seraphic Teachings into question."

Knowing their people could not become peace-loving overnight, Valieda and the clergy carefully crafted rules under which war would be waged.

Thanks to the generosity of Sagrado Valieda, they were able to reconstruct their city destroyed eons ago during the Era of Expansion.",
												"Some legends still tell how tall the city was, perched on a high mountain, made entirely of granite. The fact that they don't agree on what exceptional cataclysm destroyed the mountain, and the city along with it, mattered not for Dragonborns, who had already turned their backs on the past. They settled in the centre of the irregular and tortured mountain area known as the Shattered Peaks, and built their new city to the glory of the Arch Seraphs.",
												"The highest honour was reserved for Empyreus, whose impressive three-hundred-foot-tall statue occupies the main square. Once again, the city is mainly built of granite quarried from the three nearest peaks, which were slowly consumed and incorporated into the structure of the city.",
												"{@b {@i The Cathedral of Embers}} - One of the three huge rock formations inside the perimeter of Ember Cairn has been excavated to house the headquarters of the Arcanist Inquisition, known as the Cathedral of Embers. This vast underground complex contains many prison cells and interrogation rooms for people accused of having magical abilities or other violations of the sacred laws. Currently, the complex is ruled by the Lord Inquisitor Crevax, a seven-foottall Dragonborn whose devotion to the sacred teachings of Empyreus is only outmatched by Sagrado Valieda himself.",
												"The Arcanist Inquisition Headquarters are a maze through which only well-trained Inquisitors can find their way. According to rumours, the cells have no locks, and the Inquisitors let prisoners loose to determine whether or not they have magical abilities: if they find an exit, they are immediately recaptured and found guilty of magical impurity. Whether true or not, the fact remains that very few people are released from this place. Those who do get out seldom escape with a healthy body and mind. Though there are other rumours that one particularly skilled individual regularly enters, and exits, the Cathedral of Embers on their own, and unharmed, for a purpose unknown.",
												"{@b {@i The Town of Thorpes}} - To all appearances, Thorpes is like any other devout town in the Castinella Provinces. Numerous temples and roadside shrines collect offerings to the Divine Seraphs, and the town maintains a modest chapter of the Arcanist Inquisition. But, as with any religion, not all of the town's congregants are willing followers. Under the cover of night in secluded buildings and slipways, the cult of the Broken Brothers amasses. A religious organization dedicated to the ways before Empyreus\u2014some say even before the gods\u2014they can be identified by their tattoos, created with vanishing ink to avoid the scrutiny of the Inquisition. Members of the Broken Brothers range from peasants to low-ranking clergy and nobles. Always looking for new converts, the Brothers show initiates the \"true way\" by forcing them to consume a mind-altering elixir that induces vivid hallucinations that they believe \"free their minds\". The true intentions of the cult are unknown, save to the highest-ranking leader known only as the Shattered Sibling. The Broken Brothers seek to show all of Etharis that the old ways are the true way, and will use any means necessary to achieve this goal, even allying with primordial powers, spellcasters, or daemons from the Netherworlds. The town of Thorpes welcomes all children of the Divine, but only accepts those who prove themselves to be truly worthy.",

They paid little attention to this emerging threat at the start, thinking such fanatical zealotry would simply self-destruct. But when it became obvious that there was no serious opposition to the rise of the Emptyreus theorcracy, and their hard-line attitude against spellcasters was sincere, the Thaumaturge sent its investigators to evaluate the threat.",
												"No one exactly knows what the Thaumaturge is up to, but the most imaginative rumour is that an expert illusionist wizard has infiltrated the Castinellan Provinces, taking the appearance of clergy members to give contradictory orders and cause confusion. Rumours grew from there- there had been an escape from the Arcanist Inquisition Headquarters; the headquarters had been infiltrated; it was all the doing of a mysterious wizard known as the Fiendish Mask. Taking the rumours seriously, the Inquisition offered an incredibly high reward for his capture. That is also the moment when immolation became the immediate punishment for almost all suspects of magical impurity..."

To conceal their escape, the refugees devised the Mist Spell that conjured a dense, constant fog over the reefs and sandbanks around the islands. Since then, only those trained by Morencia's famous Guild of Navigators have been able to lead a ship through the Misty Reefs.",

Merchants are welcomed but tightly monitored, and they are forced to stay in specific districts during the night. Citizenship is never granted to such merchants except in exceptional circumstances, and they are not allowed to reside in Morencia for too long. This forces constant incoming and outgoing flows of population that are a further boon to the Morencian economy.",
												"But, while Morencia limits the influence of foreign merchants within its walls, Morencia's merchants are themselves a powerful force throughout Etharis. Morencia is the seat of the continent-spanning Augustine Trading Company, which works everywhere to bend the flow of gold and goods towards itself. Within Morencia, the Augustine Trading Company has worked to align other entities' interests with its own. It has absorbed Morencia's powerful Bankers Guild, and through them it has come to control the city's Supreme Council as well.",
												"The Castinellan Provinces have attempted to take control of Morencia on numerous occasions, using both force and subterfuge. Their most recent but unsuccessful attempt involved capturing a member of the Navigators Guild and forcing him to lead a Castinellan armada through the Misty Reefs. Only the cunning intervention of the Charneault Kingdom saved Morencia from annexation. Grand Shaman Aethorion, helped by a small group of elven shamans, was able to interact with the Mist Spell to bring the Charneault Kingdom's ships directly to the rear of the Castinellan armada.",
												"A terrible battle took place at Morencia's doorstep, and although the Castinellan armada managed to destroy a large portion of the Morencian fleet stationed in the Arsenal of Morencia, the Charneault Kingdom's ships and the remaining Morencian defence forces led by Admiral Endoria Onaglie managed to surround and overwhelm the attackers. Only a few Castinellan ships survived, though the defenders also suffered heavy losses.",
												"Since then, the Castinella Provinces have yet to attempt another military conquest, but they have not given up their ambition of controlling Morencia. They have recently strengthened their connections with the Augustine Trading Company, which many Morencians see as the explanation for a series of underhanded moves by the Bankers Guild Master Kolhys.",
												"The truth is more complex, but many have noted that the Bankers Guild profited immensely in the aftermath of the Castinellan Provinces' attack. Backed by the Augustine Trading Company's coffers, the Bankers Guild offered a generous loan for the reconstruction of the Morencian fleet, but the offer was so generous that it aroused greater suspicion. Finally, Doge Lorenzo Flabenici was able to steer the Supreme Council on another course that would turn out to be even more dangerous. To raise the funds, the Supreme Council opened the way to the sale of its seats. This was supposed to allow any guild or other community to earn a place on the Supreme Council, but bids became so high that many had to arrange astronomical loans from the Bankers Guild to purchase their seat.",
												"Moreover, the Bankers Guild itself was able to buy the biggest share of the available seats. In addition to empowering the Bankers Guild, this sequence of events considerably weakened the position of the Doge."

His origins are another mystery that fuels both fascination and distrust among the Morencians. Whatever the truth may be, he is a man with considerable power thanks to the immense fortune the Bankers Guild sits on. First commanding the Bankers Guild, he controversially allowed the Augustine Trading Company to buy a controlling portion of the Guild. Though dwarfed by the Augustine Trading Company, the Morencian Bankers Guild became the Company's single largest constituent, and Kolhys leveraged this position to rise through the Augustine Trad ing Company's ranks until he commanded both organizations. Kolhys was the very first banker to obtain a seat on Morencia's Supreme Council, which immediately provoked controversy. More over, he has been accused numerous times of corrupting other council members, but has never been convicted, as his accusers always either suddenly withdrew their complaints or disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Many believe that now the Bankers Guild, the Augustine Trading Company, and the Morencian Supreme Council are effectively the same entity. If that's true, they have Kolhys to thank-or curse-for it."

The variety and the quality of the available products and merchandise were simply unequalled in Etharis, even by the city-state of Morencia. These days are likely gone forever now that the Weeping Pox has devastated Liesech. If the market persists at all in the disease-stricken city, it is doubtlessly in a debased and corrupted form."

The High Belfry was constructed centuries ago by one of the first Bouwengracht governors, and this major place of power remained under their control until the Red Morning. The centre of the city is now ruled by the Cult of the Black Lady, and rumours say that Analita von Raiza takes her regenerating sleep on the highest floor of the High Belfry.",

Many churches were constructed for the cult in Liesech, but the most important is the Froth Church, the place where every Bouwengracht family member used to be buried. Built on the city's westernmost quay, the Froth Church is in direct contact with the sea. A small channel was set up to allow passage to the waters of the bay\u2014and to allow the secret delivery of morbid offerings to the Filth Grazer. Because of that foul visitor, the sea around the church always foams and froths, hence its name."

Otto Bouwengracht, the first known patriarch of the family, is the most famous. But the family is now fading slowly into oblivion after being slaughtered by Analita von Raiza during the event known as the Red Morning.

This is no surprise, as such creatures are very rare and hardly intelligible to lesser beings such as humans. All that can be said for sure about it is that it possesses an inextinguishable thirst for the filth from human activities. There are stories about its actual appearance, some of which describe tentacles and rumbling supernatural voices, but they can be no more than rumours as no one comes back from the Eye of the Sea where the beast resides, feasting on rotting corpses and filth.",
										"{@b {@i Vampire Countess Analita Von Raiza}} - Countess Analita von Raiza is probably is one of the oldest known vampires. Captured centuries ago during an old war between ancient Bürach tribes, she was held captive in a sophisticated magical sarcophagus whose makers have been long forgotten. As a higher vampire, she is almost impossible to kill as she is resistant to wounds that would slay a mortal. But this does not mean she is invincible, as she barely survived her encounter with the Filth Grazer. She now lies regenerating in the High Belfry, waiting for the Weeping Pox to pass before she emerges as the unchallenged ruler of Liesech."

Every Thaumaturge member has agreed to be placed under a powerful geas that keeps them from betraying each other's confidence.",

These are stories where good doesn't always prevail, and heroes aren't always good. Handled well, the adventures you have in Etharis can be thrilling, thought-provoking, unsettling, and unique. To strike the right balance of tones for your game, consider the elements of the different genres below.",
								{
									"type": "entries",
									"name": "Grimdark",
									"page": 207,
									"entries": [
										"Grimdark is like film noir, in the sense that both genres realise that there are no truly good heroes left. In either setting, everyone struggles with impossible moral choices.",
										"Even supposedly good people are flawed, while villains don't think twice about committing atrocities. A happy ending where everyone survives is unlikely.",
										"Grimdark fantasy adopts realism, albeit from the grittier side of the spectrum. The horrors and ills of a real society exist in this one-only this time, no one questions why they are there. Racism, classism, and hyper-nationalism are all par for the course, and upsetting the status quo can have actual unhappy consequences for the defiant parties.",
										"When it comes to war, a grimdark setting won't emphasise the glory and heroism of battle so much as the sacrifices made to win, the costs to innocent lives, the destruction of homes, and the toll on the soldiers on both sides of the conflict.",
										"As for magic, it often comes at an unspeakable cost and with terrible consequences when things go wrong. Infernal pacts that cost souls and unleash eldritch horrors are a prime example.",
										"That said, it's important that everything happens as a consequence of choices the characters made. A world that is cruel for cruelty's sake is not only illogical, but it's also boring and hard to navigate for players. A grimdark setting must serve a purpose-to highlight the risks of the campaign, and to engage the players with realism. Using it purely for shock value will eventually wear down your players, and likely yourself as well."

										"Horror is by no means the easiest genre to create stories for. It relies on the right amount of tension, atmosphere, and imagery to work. If these are lacking, or if they're overdone, it can quickly turn into unintended comedy.",
										"There are many levels of horror, including terror, dread, and revulsion. Revulsion is easy to elicit; it can come from something as straightforwardly disgusting as slipping on a pile of corpses and falling into a pool of blood and viscera.",
										"Dread is more difficult. It requires slow-building tension and a description of an atmosphere that is both immediate and mysterious. The idea is to give the player the feeling that something terrible is about to happen, but they don't quite know when it will happen. The longer you can sustain this build-up, the more powerful the release. So you can describe them going down a dark corridor or a shadowy forest, and they would catch glimpses of creatures moving from the corner of their eyes. They know they are being followed and an attack is imminent-but they don't know when or by what.",
										"The final layer is terror, a release of emotion that comes from shock and the realisation that something horrible is happening that is beyond the players' control. This is difficult to evoke since most players often feel in control of situations thanks to their power and abilities. The key is in catching them unawares and upending their expectations. For example, the party could defeat the seemingly human corrupt inquisitor, only for his head to split open and reveal a monstrous, tentacled thing using human flesh as its shell. From a moment like this you not only get revulsion but a possible heart-stopping kick in the gut."

A cursed princess who must slay those she marries on her wedding night. Evil fairies whose gifts are never as they seem, and will both help and hinder those who accept them. These are some of the many tropes of dark fairy tales.",
										"Dark fairy tales are similar to the grimdark genre, only they lean towards fantasy instead of realism. Things begin as outwardly normal, even hopeful. Then the screws begin to tighten as the characters discover the reality of their situation.",

										"Exemplified in the works of authors Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock, the sword and sorcery genre sets aside idealism for a world soaked in mud, blood, and magic.",
										"Much like the grimdark genre, sword and sorcery approaches a fantastic setting from an amoral perspective, with a particular focus on action. Characters live in a gritty, violent world of barbarism, corrupt kings, evil sorcerers, sword wielding warriors, and horrifying beasts that threaten damsels-in-inevitable-distress. It can be set in a fallen kingdom or a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland. Most of all, the combat scenes are visceral, dynamic, and absolutely blood-soaked.",
										"The other half of the equation, magic, is similarly important. Like with grimdark, magic is essentially dangerous, difficult to control, and forbidden. Those who use it pay a high price in terms of blood, souls, or their own humanity.",
										"Whether a campaign is grimdark, horror-based, dark fairy tales, or sword-and-sorcery, remember to give your players a break. A campaign full of relentless cruelty and darkness can get old if that's all you present. Let there be moments of peace, triumph, humor, and lightheartedness to let their mind rest before going back into the fray. As with anything, variety makes the difference."
