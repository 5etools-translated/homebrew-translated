Whether you want to give the mercenary your players are talking to an air of mystery, or really delve into your rogue's tragic backstory, there are as many reasons to give a character a tattoo as there are for a person to choose one themselves. On the following pages, you will find roll tables for the tattoo's design, placement, minor magical properties and, if you choose, more beneficial magical enchantments. You can use these tables to randomly generate tattoos, or choose whatever design, placement and effect you think would best suit the character.",

						"One of the most appealing aspects of a tattoo for an adventurer is the fact that they can be imbued with magical properties. On this page you will find two lists of potential enchantments, minor magical properties and advantageous enchantments. Minor enchantments provide flavour, and can be helpful to the creative adventurer in some situations, but do not provide explicit gameplay bonuses. Advantageous enchantments, on the other hand, give statistical bonuses, similar to common and uncommon wondrous items. If you are designing a player character, they may start the game with a tattoo with a minor magical property, but are unlikely to have an advantageous enchantment at this point in their journey. As a Dungeon Master, you can treat tattoos with enchantments as if they were magical items, giving them as rewards, or requiring players to earn them in some way. For example, a village of halflings may have a master tattooist who will only work with those who have helped the community in some way.",
