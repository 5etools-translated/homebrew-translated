This traveling tavern's tracks can run through any number of locations to suit your campaign\u2014above ground and below, between cities and towns, through the countryside, over the mountains, or along the coast. The track can be circular for an infinite loop to bring you back to where you started, or an end-to-end journey with adventure along the way. As a variant way to play using this book, the Rail-Away can serve as a cruise vessel that visits all the other taverns in order.",

Alternatively, you can play through its combination of quests and a murder mystery event using the NPCs provided.",
