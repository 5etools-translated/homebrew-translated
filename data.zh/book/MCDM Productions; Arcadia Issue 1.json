										"Uqaviel is a master of controlling the battlefield\u2014and is at an advantage in an arena with level earth and open sky. He begins combat by disabling the most obvious melee threat with his {@i Chakram of the Firmament} and the most obvious ranged threat with his {@i Chakram of the Mantle}. Throughout a fight, he either strategically places his chakrams to keep scattered opponents incapicitated, or devastates grouped foes with Dawn's Fury.",
										"在流放过程中，乌卡维尔只在其他被天庭唾弃的天人中结交了几个值得信赖的盟友。他拒绝与恶魔或其他黑暗势力结盟。如果他没有完成他的仪式，当战斗不利于他时，Uqaviel会尽快逃跑（通过传送或飞走）。如果他的仪式成功完成，乌卡维尔就会战斗到死，除非他的对手说服他，让他投降并恢复他以前的荣耀还不算太晚。"

										"阿娜希塔在距离上最有效，她避免在不利的地形上与敌人交战。如果她选择了她的竞技场，它就有一个她可以控制的高地；如果被偷袭，她会立即占领最高点。她以一支致盲箭开启战斗，使敌人丧失战斗力，并以穿刺箭或爆裂箭尽可能多地打击敌人。随着战斗的继续，她用传说中的行动来保持距离，并用致盲凝视或窒息箭来削弱紧迫的威胁。",

If there's no need for deception, she could have several {@creature erinyes} or {@creature horned devil||horned devils} at her service. When it's clear that Anahita can't win an encounter, she attempts to teleport away and turns {@condition invisible} to flee. However, if escape isn't an option, the treacherous archangel is not above striking a deal, promising wealth and power to foes willing to turn to her side."
