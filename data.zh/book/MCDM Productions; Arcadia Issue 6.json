						"Unique villains create memorable stories. Engaging encounters, immersive worlds, and compelling NPCs are all important, but when asked what they remember about campaigns from years past, the first thing many players bring up is that goblin who got away during the first battle, then returned as a dragon-riding sorcerer, and then came back again as a lich for the final encounter. In decades of playing, I've forgotten tavern conversations, tactical battles, NPCs, entire worlds, and even the names and classes of some of my old characters, but I can still tell you almost turn-by-turn about my showdowns with unique villains.",
						"I love playing the game with new players because many of the creatures and tropes experienced gamers take for granted are new to the humans at the table. \"A bugbear? What's that?\" the newbies ask as us GMs giggle with maniacal glee. Every villain that crosses a new player's path is exciting and memorable because of its novelty. Even if greenhorn players know a monster from popular media, like trolls or vampires, they don't know what the game's version of that villain is like, and they have no idea what unique spin the GM will put on the creature. Heck, with new players, us GMs even get to march out old villains and stories we've used before (or borrow them from another GM's game) and these players love to hate these baddies because it's all new to them.",
						"Of course, most of us don't run games for new players every session, especially if we're part of a long-term campaign. And newbies go very quickly from, \"Oh no! What's a kobold?\" to \"Let's run these pipsqueaks over to get to the treasure.\" This is a game about fighting monsters, after all. That means the monsters need to be compelling and there needs to be a lot of them. Villain ideas get used up rather quickly! Each time a GM spends time spinning out a unique villain, that's one more idea that they likely can't use with their group again. After a year of my best brain babies once a week, what can I give my players to surprise them\u2014to say nothing of the friends I started playing with nearly twenty years ago?",
						"To keep my games fresh, I pull villains out of supplements and drop them into my campaign. If I can grab a premade villain with a unique stat block, it saves me time and energy in addition to giving me fresh stuff to put into my game. I might put my own spin on them or smash them together with a second monster to create something new. I don't think there's any published element of the game I use more than villains, and I know other GMs are similar, since monsters have their own book in the core rules! While {@i ARCADIA} featured some cool antagonists in previous issues, the one you're reading now presents the best selection yet.",
						"{@link Michael E. Shea|https://twitter.com/SlyFlourish} provides four new evil characters that form a rival adventuring party to take on the player characters. Each member of the Grim Accord has a deep backstory and unique traits that make them a worthy villain as an individual. Together, this fiercely loyal band is unstoppable\u2014or are they?",
						"{@link Gabe Hicks|https://twitter.com/GabeJamesGames} gives you an entirely different kind of villain in \"Armor of Zevellon.\" An evil demigod of chaos magic bound himself to the pieces of his old armor and returns to life when the set is assembled. Having a villain reveal himself in a mysterious slow burn is my kind of story. The best part about this villain is that the characters might be the ones to summon him in their attempt to gather each piece of the powerful armor.",
						"Finally, {@link H.H. Carlan's|https://twitter.com/stopthtoldwoman} \"Spelunking\" brings us one of the best types of villains: a new legendary creature with lair actions and a tragic backstory. Fawning Summerset doesn't go down easy.",
