						"{@b IMPORTANT NOTICE:} Although this crafting system leverages many existing mechanics published under the {@link 5e SRD and OGL|https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd}, the final product is completely home-brewed. The finer details of this system are still being revised, and those changes will slowly be introduced into this document. However, the system as a whole is totally functional and ready to be used in any campaign. Furthermore, the rules and concepts discussed are intended to work in-tandem with the expanded artisan's tools rules found in {@link Xanathar's Guide to Everything|https://5e.tools/book.html#XGE}. If nothing else I hope this document and its siblings can be used as a source of guidance and inspiration for whatever crafting system you decide to go with.",
						"There are a lot of things that players and DMs disagree on when it comes to 5th edition. Should natural 1s and 20s matter on ability checks?  Should we use critical hit tables in our campaign? Does Eldritch Blast need to be removed from the game?",

								"As you read on, you may notice my system has some similarities to the standard crafting system. Despite the shortcomings of the existing system, I did my best to leverage the parts that did work. The end result allows players to create items faster, involves more dice rolling, gives players access to tool proficiencies, and allows them to boost these proficiencies over time."

This section is basically the same as the original rules, but I added some clarification on what the artisans are spending their money on during the crafting process for magical items.",
										"{@b Means of Production -} Some crafting processes only require the crafting kit, but others may require special equipment, like a forge. Magical items can also require special conditions for the item to be made. This section is similar to the original rules, but I added some structure to the mechanics around crafting locations.",
										"{@b Instructions -} Either memorized instructions or a written blueprint/recipe detailing the materials and the process. This section is nearly identical to the original rules.",
										"{@b Labor -} Once all four of the previous conditions are satisfied, the crafting process can begin. The artisans work in 8 hour increments to contribute progress measured in GP. This section is heavily modified from the original rules."
