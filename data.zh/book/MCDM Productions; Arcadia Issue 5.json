						"The Circle of the Gilded's rules about finding and embedding gems into your body are intentionally worded so that a druid with this subclass doesn't need to spend time finding and incorporating the gems they want to use into their body. The rules take pressure off the GM to provide specific gems so that a player can use their character's features. A druid also doesn't need to buy these gems. This is similar to the way a wizard adds two spells to their spellbook whenever they gain a level for free, or how a ranger meets an animal companion after entering a specific subclass. Those two spells cost no time or money, and the ranger pays nothing and spends no time on the initial recruitment of their beast friend. The same goes for the druid. You might decide your druid slowly incorporates their gems into their body overtime, performs a ritual while resting, or undergoes a surgical procedure. These gems might be family heirlooms you inherit, stones grown in a magic garden, or treasures you found during downtime between adventures. Work with your GM to determine the narrative. Similarly, swapping out one gem for another doesn't require the GM to reward the druid with the new stone they want to use."

If the result of the die is a 10, the flock also attacks. Use the swarm of cursed ravens stat block below, where the Flock Bonus (FB) is the number of ravens in your flock divided by 10, rounded up (e.g. 1 FB for 10 ravens, but 2 FB for 11 ravens). If you are still cursed after you have successfully fought off the flock, a new one begins to form upon your next use of the cursed item.",

						"I think about diamonds a lot\u2014fantasy diamonds. In the real world, these engagement stones are worth a lot of cash, but in fifth edition, these rocks bring people back from the dead. I want to create a world where diamonds are mined to scarcity and hoarded by the wealthy. Adventurers plan and execute heists to steal the gems, maybe to help the oppressed or to sell on the black market, and eventually make an enemy of the diamond-mongering aristocracy, secretly led by a corrupt ancient gold dragon! Yes, the nobles have soldiers, diamond golems, and more to battle the heroes, but they also have enough wealth that they might simply be able to pay those greedy adventurers off. Will the characters sell out?",
						"I think about this campaign idea because it honestly seems to me the way things would go in a world where diamonds are the key to resurrection (cynical as that worldview may be). It is human nature to cheat death at all costs. By drawing on that universal truth, we can create stories for our games that feel authentic and grounded in reality, even though we all know that diamonds can't actually revive the dead. To make an entire world, I took a single element of the game, and a small one\u2014a spell component, and developed it further than the existing rule. I asked, \"What happens if diamonds are a key part of performing miracles?\"",
						"In a high fantasy game with complex systems, there are thousands of questions that lead to incredible stories if you try to answer them with sincerity. If bards, clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers can all cast {@spell lesser restoration}, how could disease ever be a problem? Dragons are super powerful and love treasure, so why wouldn't they get out of their caves more often and plunder, plunder, plunder? If wizardry can be taught, do (possibly predatory) banks loan money to farmers so their kids can go to wizard college?",
						"There are no wrong answers to these questions, but the most authentic responses often lead to the most interesting and relatable stories and creations. Maybe your next campaign world has magic-resistant diseases, active bandit dragons, and too many wizards and not enough farmers! Sounds like a fun place to play.",
						"The three articles in this issue of {@i ARCADIA} take some big questions and follow them to interesting and authentic conclusions. Leon Barillaro mused, \"If most curses can be easily removed by a 3rd-level spell, then eventually someone would make curses built to last. How do those work?\" Carlos Cisco thought, \"If some adventurers are only in it for the gold, then greed is one of their core values. How might that theme express itself in some subclasses?\" And finally, Sam Mannell asked, \"Since many wizards can travel the planes, what other spells might they see or be inspired to create?\" Those simple thoughts brought you articles filled with new curses, subclasses, monsters, and spells.",
						"I encourage you to do the same in your games. We have good fun making memes or laughing with friends about what might happen if you get some demon ichor in an open wound...but what WOULD happen? The questions may seem silly at times, but the assumptions can unlock awesome new stories.",

								"Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy. When he came of age and his parents decided to teach him how to manage the mines, he was initially horrified. They exploited their miners for little pay and forced them to work in dangerous conditions under strict contracts that prevented departure. Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it.",
								"But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to {@deity Pta'u|Unknown|Ar5} to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied. He convinced his workers that their labor in his service was a path to the divine. Their hard work, sweat, and tears would lead to countless rewards in the next life... and countless rewards in this life for Garin.",
								"加林是一个最高级别的繁荣传教士，他保持着一个强大的、有雇佣兵意识的冒险家的密切联系，并指挥着一群被洗脑的邪教劳动者的忠实追随者，他们真的死也要把新开采的宝石交给他。加林经常被发现管理他的各种企业，但最近他感到冒险的瘙痒，并开始旅行，寻找更多的资源（包括物质和人形）来开发。",
								"加林从来不会在没有准备好的战场或大量小兵的情况下面对敌人。他的主要策略是在他和敌人之间保持尽可能多的炮灰，同时加强他的军团和自己。他很好地利用了他的先知动机功能，使他的盟友和他自己都能得到buff，同时使用{@spell guardian of faith}和{@spell spirit guardians}等法术来控制战场，使之符合他的意愿。他是一个内心懦弱的人，如果他看到形势对他不利，他就会让他的部下去死。",

								"There is nothing quite like the neckprickling sensation of a {@spell scrying} sensor watching over you. While magic exists to detect scrying\u2014and even to prevent it in the first place\u2014the scryed-upon ultimately has few options. Detecting a scrying sensor has little value; you do not learn who is watching you or why, only that you are not alone.",
								"因此，我发现这个咒语特别有意义。虽然相当具有报复性，但它为敏捷的法师提供了一个选择，如果他们能看到探查传感器，就可以将其击倒。断开连接对你不受欢迎的观察者来说是非常迷惑的，而且能产生相当有效的威慑。此外，尽管这个咒语最初是为了切断魔法连接而设计的，但它也能很好地切断生物的突触，使它成为你袖子里的一张危险的王牌。",
