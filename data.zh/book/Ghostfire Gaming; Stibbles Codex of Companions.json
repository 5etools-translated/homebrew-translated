Cats are famous for their ability to land feet-first. A cat that falls more than a few feet will right itself in the air, landing on its feet and rarely suffering any harm, even after falling from great heights. Legend speaks of a wizard who tied two cats together, back-to-back, causing them to rapidly spin in the air to generate power for their rituals."

A threatened opossum will enter a state that is a remarkably convincing imitation of death. The opossum loses consciousness, goes stiff, and even produces a scent akin to that of a dead animal. Experienced hunters exploit this state, simply picking a stunned opossum up by its tail for later use. They return to consciousness on their own, no worse for wear, after about an hour. Younger, less experienced opossums may enter this state whenever something startles them.",

The spirit then made enough arrows to fill a dozen quivers using materials from the forest.

When necessary, feluros use their lengthy tails as incredibly powerful tools of momentum, practically allowing them to fly through treelines at incredible speeds and change directions on a dime. They most often use their tails as traps, hanging them down from treetop perches and entangling any unwelcome trespassers. It is said that as a feluros' wisdom grows, so does the length of this tail.

They are just as likely to challenge a foe in a battle of wits as they are to hunt them. Any creature to best a feluros has earned its right into the guarded domain, and any creature that attempts to flee will be hunted mercilessly. In their time as guardians, a feluros occasionally finds a creature who they consider a superior, and are inclined to join them."

However, a truly attentive listener may be able to gain insight from the loftus' incisive questions.",

A loftus can use this control over wind in other ways as well, such as to move objects or protect itself."

					"Awakened mugs live to serve, a truth so literal that they wouldn't exist without it. Conceived by a wizard whose ingenuity was matched only by his laziness, animated mugs possess a spark of intelligence and autonomy that allow them to provide appropriate libations when needed, even without explicit instructions.",
					"Ironically, with that intelligence come some complications. Awakened mugs become restless when shut up in a cupboard or backpack, and tend to act out if not used regularly. They much prefer to wander freely, or wobble along behind their owner during a journey. Fortunately, they come when called\u2014or, indeed, when they expect their master to be thirsty, whether they've been called or not.",
					"Self-Filling. The awakened mug can magically fill itself with various liquids when asked, or when the mug feels like it. The mug can bring its contents to a boil, nearly freeze it, or completely alter its flavor. Flavor alteration sounds like quite the cash cow for tavern owners, who all quickly learn they don't actually get to pick the flavors. Awakened mugs often develop strange, almost fey senses of humor. With masters who can appreciate such humor, a strong friendship quickly forms.",
					"Mixological Memory. Perhaps the most useful ability of the animated mug is its memory. The mug can recall any drink that has ever been poured into it, and recreate that drink when it refills itself. The mug can't recreate the supernatural elements of magic potions\u2014that would truly be nonsense. But, it can fix you a Cosmopolitan the way you had it that one time, while you were hiding from pit fiends in a cave in the lower planes, and that might be just as impressive.",
					"Feud. Awakened mugs have an entirely irrational hostility toward other animated objects. They will take any opportunity to spill their contents on rugs of smothering, animated suits of armor, and any other objects they perceive as rivals. Their complete lack of actual combat ability makes their aggressive endeavors quite the slapstick show for bar patrons."

Whenever a clockwork buddy is discovered, artisans and collectors rush to acquire it, hoping to discover its secrets. This gnome's motives can only be guessed from what they gave the world: deathless creatures that blur the line between a toy and a true friend.",
					"Modular Design. A clockwork buddy's limbs can be detached, reconnected, and even swapped with other clockwork buddies. Some buddies are clearly mismatched when discovered, such as a dragon with a music box for a head, a gnome illusionist with wheels in place of legs, or a snuggly rabbit with a flamethrower in place of a tail."

Luckily for the most vain of adventurers, Ladro the Avaricious has decided to put the instructions and ingredients for this ritual on the market: for more than a pretty copper, naturally. Each fetchen is entirely unique, and entirely tied to its creator's existence.",
					"Tethered by Fate. A fetchen's existence is no more than an extension of its creator. It cannot act or think without some semblance of direction, and dies the instant its master is slain. As a part of the ritual, detailed below, the very life force of its maker is a vital ingredient.",
					"Incomplete Design. To the dismay of some adventurers, the fetchen can't replicate its creator's face, and its visage is devoid of features. It is unable to communicate using anything more than gestures, and lacks complete intelligence. A number of refunds have been attempted after rather embarrassing actions were performed by a fetchen.",
					"Ladro's Homunkit. The instructions for creating a fetchen are detailed extensively in the \"kit\" produced by Ladro. 1 cubic foot of clay-like matter, provided by the kit, must be infused with the blood of a humanoid with at least 10 hit points. The process of creating the fetchen reduces the creator's hit point maximum by 1 hit die, and the fetchen gains health equal to the maximum amount that die can roll (or 4 hit points, whichever is higher). This health is returned to its creator if the fetchen is killed.",
					"The material must then be placed into a waterskin, a clay or leather egg, or a glass container. After two weeks, the fetchen grows to the size of the chamber (ranging from ½ foot to 2 feet tall). It then emerges from the egg, wearing clothing identical to the clothing its master wore when creating it. If the clothing grants the creator an AC bonus, the fetchen also gains that bonus (up to +4). Their statistics are also based on their creator, gaining the following ability scores, assigned from highest to lowest, in the same order as their creator's ability scores ranked from highest to lowest: 14, 12, 10, 10, 8, 6.",
					"The fetchen's speed equals half of their creator's speed, and they gain any senses their creator currently has. The homunkit also provides an assortment of tiny weapons, each one capable of dealing 1d4 damage: a shortsword, a handaxe, a warhammer, and a shortbow (with a range of 10/25 feet)."

In their solitary periods they can form connections with members of other species who they do not consider threats. It is uncommon for savanna tatzelwurms to hunt humanoids, and some may even befriend one if the promise of consistent prey is made. Expert hunters may spend years watching a tatzelwurm, learning from a master of its craft, and some barbarian tribes hold up savanna tatzelwurms as their totem. Young hunters may prove themselves by seeking out a tatzelwurm and surviving the encounter.",
					"Threads of History. Many scholars have entertained possible ways that these creatures came to be. The most common assumption ties them to crafty wizards that grafted animals together, forming dangerous hunters on a whim. Others have examined their scale formation and shedding, noting exceptional similarities between tatzelwurms and dragons. This connection is reinforced by the authority these creatures have over their homes, and the fear they incite in the hearts of those that live near them."

					"The bloom crawler is an unusual plant that bears an uncanny resemblance to a toad. They are strong and hardy creatures that often choose to ignore fights they're capable of winning. Left to itself, a bloom crawler uses its power of locomotion to follow the sun, always staying where the light is most direct. They trample meandering trails through their forests, and unwary travelers may find themselves following a bloom crawler in circles, mistakenly assuming they've found a game trail. ",
					"Diverse Diet. Bloom crawlers get nearly all of their energy from sunlight, but as they follow the sun they also graze indiscriminately, swallowing grass and soil alike. They use viney tendrils to smack bugs out of the air around them, devouring anything that sticks to the vines. Oddly, they can't digest the seeds of fruit or other vegetation, and instead carry them alongside its own seeds.",
					"Vegetative Defenses. Being energetic piles of vegetation, bloom crawlers sometimes must defend themselves against creatures that would nibble on them. Instead of using the force of its full body, or its toothy maw, a bloom crawler uses its vine tendrils to rapidly whip enemies. It can also spit its seeds with great force, which is useful in propagating its species but also serves as a weapon that dissuades most threats.",
					"Animal Helpers. Although they can fend off most large herbivores, bloom crawlers often find themselves overwhelmed by insects they simply can't manage. Bloom crawlers encourage birds to visit their leaves to help eat the bugs that vex them, creating a partnership that benefits both. More intelligent creatures have learned to take advantage of this need, learning that the bloom crawler will follow any creature that helps it clean its leaves. Some communities of wood elves have used this trick to gather bloom crawlers into semi-domesticated herds."

Others choose to continue their fight, wandering the world in search of new places where nature is wounded. They may become companions to wandering druids who right wrongs in the natural world.",

However, it is true that when a turf takes root and does not move, even the sharpest eye would never know the presence of the turf. An enemy of nature could find itself surrounded, thinking it is standing alone in an empty field. If the turfs prevail, they cover over their enemy so that it can feed the next generation of plants and fungi."

The presence of a partially-devoured carcass underneath an innocuous-looking vine is a clear warning.",

When excited, the vine's tendrils can dart out as quickly as any snake. The snake heads' many eyes, ears, and noses make the vine snake surprisingly perceptive. They almost always detect an approaching creature in time to still themselves and resume their disguise.",

					"Some creatures' loyalty to their humanoid friends persists after their death. A renine is the spirit of an exceptionally loyal creature that was separated from its master and died before finding them again. The unfinished search binds the renine to the realm of the living, forever tied to its master. A renine appears as a ghostly image of the creature it was in life, albeit translucent and often floating above the ground. If obstructed in its search, the renine can fight with the ferocity and determination of a living creature. More often, though, renines are incorporeal and elusive, perceptible only by the sound of a distant whimper.",
					"Reunion. As a spirit, a renine continues its search for as long as needed until it and its master are reunited. In other regards it behaves as it did in life. If a renine does not know where to look for its missing master, it may follow someone who reminds it of its master. Such pairings are temporary, however, and the renine never gives up its search.",
					"When a renine finds its master alive, it tries to rejoin them and accompany them once again. A welcomed renine will never spend even a moment away from its old friend, persisting until its master's final breath. Once that happens, the renine then passes to the next world along with the master's spirit. If the master is dead when the renine finds them, the renine instead becomes an eternal guardian of their resting place.",
					"Rejection. The most horrible fate for a renine is to find its old master and be turned away. When this happens, the renines spirit completely changes to one of fear, hatred, and retribution. First, it will attack its old master and any of their allies or companions. Thereafter it becomes a scourge to the old master's kind, wandering the night and assaulting the living with eternal cries, forever mourning its rejection."
