				"Thick straps stamped with intricate sigils are buckled around the red leather cover of this massive book. The work inside is a handwritten manuscript, filled with footnotes, revisions, and corrections. The book contains a history of all significant events for the last two hundred years\u2014and this history can be edited. A careless scratch can erase the founding of a kingdom and a quick note can change the outcome of a war. Revising history creates a new, branching timeline in which that change applies.",
				"The ripple effect of unintended consequences is significant, and changes always come with severe, unwelcome consequences: the early death of an evil king creates a power vacuum that allows a new tyrant to rise; preventing a plague leads to overpopulation and famine.",

						"{@link We're back.|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOkSvLqkafU} Thanks to your support, {@i ARCADIA} 4 is in your hands, and we're working on the magazine indefinitely. I truly mean it when I say that we wouldn't be here without you. So on behalf of all of us at MCDM, thank you!",
						"You're probably wondering, \"What does the future hold for {@i ARCADIA}?\" After {@loader ARCADIA 3|book/MCDM Productions; Arcadia Issue 3.json} was published, we launched a survey on Patreon about {@i ARCADIA} and MCDM in general and learned a lot of information. Over 2,500 people responded. Thanks again.",
						"Much of what you told us simply confirmed what we knew to be true: many of you are Game Masters looking for high-utility articles that will help you create encounters, adventures, and worlds. I think what did surprise us was that more than 90% of you are GMs, and almost 70% of you are forever GMs, the kind of person who never takes on the role of a player character (by choice or by circumstance). We had no idea that the numbers were that high.",
						"One of the other numbers that initially took us by surprise was the types of {@i ARCADIA} articles that readers find most useful. New creatures outpaced every other option, followed by magic items, encounters, locations, and spells in that order. Given how many GMs read {@i ARCADIA}, it was incredible to me that adventures didn't crack the top 5. But when I looked at what did make the most popular list, I realized why. Our GMs prefer to build their own worlds and create unique stories with the players. You want the building blocks to make adventures and don't always want a near-complete story handed to you.",
						"The more we break down the building blocks, the more useful our readers find the article. Drop-in encounters, which build adventures, aren't as popular as new creatures, which are used to build encounters. The more basic the piece of material, we found, the easier it is for you to use in your campaigns.",
						"So what changes are in store for {@i ARCADIA} moving forward? For the next several issues, it may not seem like a lot. For one thing, articles for many of near-future issues were commissioned before we conducted the survey, in order to bring you content in a timely manner. We also want to keep including articles with new subclasses, ancestries, and other player character options because we hope to grow and diversify {@i ARCADIA's} audience.",
						"However, within articles that provide player options, you'll also find useful tools for the GM. Remember the \"Titan Heart\" article by {@link Gabe Hicks|https://twitter.com/GabeJamesGames} in {@loader ARCADIA 1|book/MCDM Productions; Arcadia Issue 1.json}? It included a sorcerer subclass, new spells, an NPC stat block, and a retainer. More like that is coming your way.",
						"We also won't stop publishing adventures any time soon, but there won't be one in every issue of {@i ARCADIA} like there was for issues 1, 2, and 3. We're going to mix it up by providing encounters, creatures, and the other building blocks of adventures. That's why this issue features a new location with creatures and magic items in {@link Cat Evans's|https://twitter.com/perpetualgloom} \"The Chained Library,\" even more creatures and magic items in {@link Willy Abeel's|https://twitter.com/TheWillyboo} article that serves as a sequel to his mounted combat piece in {@loader ARCADIA 1|book/MCDM Productions; Arcadia Issue 1.json}, and a bunch of drop in encounters from {@link Derek Ruiz|https://twitter.com/ElvenTower}. When we have adventures in the future, they'll be easy to strip for parts or present a unique concept, like rules and an adventure for level-0 characters or a module meant for a party of goblin heroes!",
						"The future of {@i ARCADIA} is bright. The journey is just beginning. Thank you for coming along with us.",
