					"当冒险公司在野外旅行时，他们经常会遇到{@creature ogre|AGGMM3}的人；大而丑陋的人形生物。偶尔，食人魔队伍中会有一两个人，他们稍微矮一点，但明显更聪明，挥舞武器的技巧超过预期。他们对自己的对手有更好的了解，他们咕哝着命令，预测冒险者的动作。通过这种方式，混血儿，食人魔和人类的问题，赢得了同类的尊重。",
					"半兽人的身高从7到8英尺不等，体重从315磅到425磅。皮肤和头发的颜色是可变的，但倾向于棕色、灰色、黑色、暗黄色（仅皮肤），或上述任何一种都带有轻微的灰绿色调。牙齿和指甲总是橙色的。大多数半食人魔都有一双类似人类的眼睛，不过大约五分之一的人有食人魔常见的白色瞳孔。他们的气味很明显，但不像全血食人魔的气味那么强烈。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"半食人魔没有自己的社会。如果他们与食人魔生活在一起，他们就是部落中思维敏捷的成员，永远都在努力证明自己的价值。如果一个半食人魔在人类社会中长大，他就会学会在怀疑和恐惧中生活，并经常转向军事或孤独的职业。",
					"偶尔，半兽人也会与半兽人、兽人、奥格瑞隆和其他人形生物结合。这些社区很小（5-200名居民），通常是孤立的，但几乎可以出现在任何地形上。半兽人填补了一个中间位置--比半兽人或兽人更强大，但比奥格瑞隆、巨魔和其他人形生物更聪明。作为一个整体，这些族群是混乱的邪恶，中立的倾向源于 \"半种姓 \"情况下必要的合作水平。他们更喜欢自己的同类，而对兽人和食人魔则持宽容态度。他们中足够多的人有人类血统，所以他们对人类持中立态度。",
					"事实上，混沌邪恶的人类经常在这样的混合部落中找到他们最热心的追随者。他们也容忍巨魔和巨人等畸形的人形生物，但对所有其他种族都抱有毫不掩饰的敌意。",
					"混合定居点突袭文明地区，以获取囚犯和战利品。一个定居点可能会被发现关押囚犯。在混血儿的营地里也有可能发现宝藏。半兽人通常会被更狡猾的兽人和半兽人骗走大部分他们应得的财宝。",
					"生态学",
					"多年来，圣人表达了许多担忧，他们想知道为什么食人魔能与人类杂交，却不能与精灵或半身人杂交。当真正的答案被发现时，圣贤们的担忧被证明是没有根据的。这个解释与任何所谓的人类和食人魔的共同起源无关，而是食人魔与兽人共有的一个不寻常的特征：快速适应性生物学。正如兽人和食人魔可以迅速适应任何地形，从森林到最高的山峰，他们的基因结构允许他们与任何类人种族繁殖。",
					"这种容易繁殖的能力经常会传给他们的后代。半食人魔也能与大多数其他人形种族成功繁殖。如果这个过程持续了很多代，结果就是一个可怕的混血儿，被称为杂种人。许多杂种人的血统中都有强烈的兽人和食人魔的血统，这可能是他们混乱的邪恶态度的原因。",
					"半食人魔在生态系统中的地位与食人魔相同：它是半人和人类的瘟疫，贪图财宝，既不做手艺，也不做好的劳动。半食人魔诗歌的雏形已经存在了很多年，但它异常丑陋，令人不安。"

					"鹞子是邪恶的鸟类，几乎捕食所有生物，但更喜欢人类和半人半兽的肉。",
					"鹞子有秃鹰的身体，但有女人的上半身和头部。他们的人类特征是年轻的，但却很丑陋，头发皱巴巴的，牙齿腐烂不堪。一股恶臭围绕着所有哈比人和他们接触的东西。",
					"哈皮人从不洗澡，也不以任何方式清洁自己。他们的衣着，如果有的话，也仅限于破烂的布条和从以前的受害者身上取来的闪亮的小饰品。",
					"竖琴的语言，与它们诱人的歌声相比，是可怕的咯咯声和尖叫声的集合。虽然也有哈比人可以说其他生物的语言的例子，但这些例子很少，而且很不容易。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"鹰身女妖在海岸线上的航道附近和人迹罕至的地方安家。在那里，它们用自己的歌声引诱旅行者走向灭亡。",
					"它们的巢穴通常是一个浅浅的山洞，它们将其玷污，直到没有动物敢接近它。除非打猎，否则它们会留在这里。",
					"蜂鸟经常把受害者带回它们的巢穴，在更熟悉的环境中吞噬它们。除了经常挂在衣服上的闪亮的小玩意外，哈比人对财宝没有什么用处。",
					"其他物品，如黄金和武器，经常夹杂在洞穴里的污秽和骨头中。这些垃圾在最古老的鹞子巢穴中可以达到几英尺深。",
					"一个典型的鹞子巢穴里有大约半打这种可恶的生物。从来没有人见过雄性鹞子，而且似乎鹞子可以随意繁殖，每隔一年就产一个蛋。鹞鹰不照顾它们的孩子，它们以尸体和洞穴中的害虫为生，直到它们自己长大到可以唱歌和狩猎。",
					"哈比人没有社会结构，经常为谁能得到受害者的哪一部分而争吵，以及何时停止折磨并开始大吃。偶尔，这些争吵会变成暴力，因此，不止一次的哈比人的盛宴开始时，最后一刻才把输掉的哈比人加入到菜单中。哈比人偶尔会同意与其他人形生物合作进行邪恶行为。",
					"生态学",
					"鹞鹰猎杀各种野兽，只要食物供应持续，它们就会一直留在一个地区。它们被所有比自己弱小的生物所鄙视和非常害怕。",
					"鹞子有一个贪婪的胃口，吞噬所有形式的人类和野兽。它们以酷刑为乐，并经常以杀人为乐。鹞子不吃的被害人会被简单地扔在那里腐烂。",
					"它们的寿命不详，但似乎约为50年。"

					"地狱猎犬是来自另一个存在空间的喷火犬类，被带到这里为邪恶的人服务。",
					"地狱猎犬类似于一只大型猎犬，毛色为铁锈红或红褐色，眼睛呈红色，会发光。斑纹、牙齿和舌头都是煤烟黑。它的肩部有两到三英尺高，有明显的烟雾和硫磺的气味。",
					"它发出的叫声有一种阴森、空洞的音调，让听到它们的人感到颤抖。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"地狱猎犬原产于那些以炎热、火热的地貌而闻名的超维空间。它们在那里成群结队地游荡，数量为2D20只。主物质位面的地狱猎犬是为了满足邪恶生物的需要而被召唤出来的。它们中的大多数后来都逃到了野外。",
					"每个族群由一只10-Hit Die地狱猎犬领导。领导者驱赶其他10个HD的对手，这些对手组成自己的族群。",
					"地狱猎犬的饮食与普通犬类相似。它们在以其巢穴为中心的1d10+4平方英里的广阔区域内游荡。犬群的领地可能会重叠在一起。",
					"它们在主物质界不容易繁殖。只有5%的邂逅包括小狗。这样的小狗是以2D4为一窝出生的。它们每天至少会不受控制地打一次火焰嗝。",
					"除了容易点燃该地区的任何易燃物外，这种火焰是无害的。新生幼犬的生长速度是成年犬的10%；它们每月迅速多长5%，并在1年内达到成年犬的完全生长速度（7高清）。",
					"在成长过程中，它们可以用燃烧的咬合力进行攻击。两个月以下的地狱猎犬小狗会造成1点伤害。较年长的，每多生长六个月就会增加1点伤害。",
					"猎物通常在被杀死的地方被吃掉，不过地狱猎犬偶尔会把尸体拖回它们的巢穴，以便以后食用。地狱猎犬也与普通犬类相似，它们可以充当寻回者。",
					"有些物品是专门寻找的；这在受过训练的地狱猎犬中尤为明显。其他的地狱猎犬只是玩玩，把捡到的东西当作玩具。它们特别喜欢嘈杂的袋子和小包，里面装满了它们已故受害者的珍宝。易燃的容器最终会在巢穴内或周围燃烧并溢出其内容。除非有不易燃的容器保护，否则很少在这里发现羊皮纸。",
					"生态学",
					"地狱猎犬在正常世界的生态中没有什么地位。它们是危险的讨厌鬼，在它们狩猎的地方容易引起火灾。除了人类以外，地狱猎犬引起的森林火灾比任何其他生物都多。不过，地狱猎犬也有其用途。",
					"由于它们能够轻易地探测到隐藏的或不可见的生物，地狱猎犬是优秀的看门狗，特别是对火巨人这样的智能怪物。",
					"如果从幼犬开始饲养，地狱猎犬可以被驯化，但每年有10%的机会，被驯化的地狱猎犬会变野。"

					"典型的河马群包括1d3只成年雄性，同等数量的母马，其余为未成熟的幼兽。有25%的几率有一匹或多匹母马怀孕。妊娠期需要10个月。在前五个月，这发生在母马体内。然后她产下一个蛋，在另外五个月内孵化。双胞胎出生的情况很少（1%的机会）。",
					"小马驹在孵化后就能行走。它的喙在最初的两周内保持柔软；这使小马驹能够吃奶。然后，它的嘴会变硬，河马就会改吃母亲吐出的食物。小马驹在四个月时学会吃固体肉，尽管它们是笨拙的杀手（攻击卷和伤害的惩罚为-4）。六个月时，它们可以飞行30英尺，战斗时攻击卷和伤害的惩罚为-2。一岁幼兽与成年兽相同，但它们在三岁之前无法繁殖。",
					"野生河马是杂食性动物。它们以任何可利用的东西为食，无论是绿色植物、水果，还是野生动物。河马能攻击相当大的猎物，如野牛，但它们不捕食食肉动物。但人形动物是个例外。在没有其他肉类的情况下，河马可能会攻击小群的人。然后，尸体被抬回巢穴喂养其他人；这时，受害者的财物通常会溢出来。河马是干净的怪物；它们通过把尸体和其他杂物搬下山来处理。它们喜欢透明、闪光的东西，如玻璃、水晶和珍贵的宝石。雄性可能会积累一个被灌木丛覆盖的小宝库。作为一种交配仪式，它将这些东西摆成一个展示台，以吸引母马。",

					"描述",
					"Hobgoblins是一个凶猛的人形种族，与其他人形种族进行着持久的战争。他们很聪明，有组织，而且富有攻击性。典型的霍布林是一个魁梧的人形生物，身高6英尺。",
					"它们多毛的皮毛从深红棕色到深灰色不等。它们的面部显示出暗红色或橘红色的皮肤。大的雄性有蓝色或红色的鼻子。霍比特人的眼睛是淡黄色或深棕色，而他们的牙齿是黄色的。他们的服装往往颜色鲜艳，往往是大胆的血红色。",
					"任何皮革都被染成黑色。霍布林的武器装备都会保持抛光和维修。霍布林有自己的语言，并经常与兽人、地精和食肉猿人交谈。大约有20%的人可以说人类的通用语言。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Hobgoblins是人形种族的噩梦般的嘲弄，他们有一个以部落为单位的军事社会。每个部落都对自己的地位有强烈的嫉妒心。与其他部落的偶然相遇会导致口头上的辱骂或公开的战斗。几乎在任何气候或地下领域都能发现游民部落。",
					"霍布金人通常以部落形式组织起来。然而，在战时或重要的军事行动中，各部落会联合起来组成一个军团。",
					"一个典型的地精部落会有（%0%）成年男性战士。",
					"- 每20个男性妖精会有1个妖精中士+2个妖精助手，每人20点命中率。",
					"- 人数超过100人的团体，由（%0%）领导。",
					"- 如果在他们的巢穴中遇到了妖精，他们将由一个（%0%）领导。首领有{@dice 5d4}的哥布林副首领充当保镖。",
					"如果在一个军团中遇到了霍比特人，将会有{@dice 10d100}的霍比特人，由{@creature hobgoblin captain|AGGMM2}或{@creature hobgoblin warlord|AGGMM2}领导，如果军团人数超过5000人。",
					"每个部落都有一个独特的战斗标准，在战斗中携带，以激励部队。如果部落首领领导战斗，他将带着标准，否则将由他的一个次首领持有。",
					"除了在一个妖精部落中存在的战士之外，还会有一半的女性和三倍于成年男性的儿童。",
					"所有已知的妖精巢穴中，有80%是地下建筑群。剩下的20%是地面村落，它们用沟渠、栅栏、至少两扇门和（%0%）警卫塔进行防御。村庄通常建立在废墟上的人形定居点上，并可能结合废墟中已经存在的防御特征。",
					"游民村落拥有大炮，其形式为每50名战士拥有2个重型弹射器、2个轻型弹射器和1个弹射器。",
					"生态学",
					"霍布林觉得自己比地精或兽人优越，并可能为他们充当领袖。在这种情况下，\"低等种族 \"被用作战斗的炮灰。霍布格林的雇佣兵可能为强大或富有的邪恶人类工作。"

					"同体人是其创造者的反映。它们具有创造者的排列方式、基本智力，甚至身体上的举止。他们是哑巴，但如果创造者是识字的，他们可以写字。他们可以协助他们的创造者完成各种任务，包括魔法工作，尽管他们自己不能施展法术。",

					"钩子恐怖是一种双足的、居住在地下的怪物，看起来像秃鹫和人的交叉体，用钩子代替手。",
					"这只钩状恐怖动物身高约9英尺，体重近350磅。它有一个坚韧的、斑驳的灰色外骨骼，像昆虫一样。它的前肢末端是12英寸长的钩子。它的腿的末端是有三个小钩子的脚，像长而尖的脚趾。它的头的形状像秃鹰，包括钩状的喙。它的眼睛是多面的。人们认为，钩角虫与蟑螂或洞穴蟋蟀有远距离关系。",
					"对人类和半人半兽来说，钩子恐怖没有气味，但动物会发现一种干燥的霉味。它们用喉咙处的外骨骼发出的一系列咔嚓声和咔嚓声进行交流。在一个山洞里，这种阴森的声音可以回响很远。它们可以用这个来估计洞穴的大小和距离，很像蝙蝠的声波雷达。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"拥有钩子而不是手的明显惩罚是，钩子恐怖不能使用武器或工具。它们只能用它们的喙来拾取物品。这严重限制了它们积累大型财宝的能力。",
					"勾魂使者一族最常居住在洞穴和地下墓穴中。入口通常在一个垂直或陡峭的岩壁上。氏族中的每个家庭单位都有自己的小洞穴，位于一个中央洞穴区之外。氏族的蛋被保存在最安全、最容易防守的地方。该部族由最年长的女性统治，她从不参加战斗。最年长的男性，经常是氏族统治者的配偶，负责所有的狩猎或其他战斗情况，并被认为是战争酋长。",
					"一个部族的成员很少相互争斗。他们可能会争吵或不合作，但他们很少发生冲突。氏族有时会相互争斗，但只有在有争执的时候，如领土争端。勾魂使者氏族想要统治大片地区或征服其他氏族的情况很少。",
					"勾魂使者与其他种族的关系不佳。虽然他们不会愚蠢地攻击强势的一方，但一般来说，其他生物被认为是肉。在面对更强大的群体时，他们会退缩。勾魂怪不承认欠债或感激。他们简单的语言甚至没有这些概念的术语。仅仅因为玩家角色拯救了钩子恐怖的生命，并不意味着它将感到感激并回报这种恩情。",
					"生态学",
					"虽然勾魂使者基本上是杂食动物，但他们更喜欢吃肉。它们几乎可以吃任何居住在洞穴中的真菌、植物、地衣或动物。钩齿虎很好地适应了山洞生活。它们几乎没有天敌，尽管任何设法抓住它们的东西都会试图吃掉它们。一个月左右后，钩子恐怖的外骨骼会变干，变得太脆，无法使用。"

					"人居环境/社会",
					"咆哮者是原产于潘德蒙隧道的野兽，在其他任何平面上都无法自然发现。即使在潘德蒙，它们也不是随处可见的。它们远离定居地区和小型隧道，更喜欢较大的弧形通道，即平原和草场。在这些平原上，它们成群结队地狩猎；因为它们是食肉的清道夫。",
					"吼叫兽群没有硬性规定的大小，这也是动物界的惯例。狼群的规模从2只到多达20只不等。这个数字包括公狼、母狼和小狼。(在一个族群中，公牛负责保护其他成员，因此在正常情况下遇到的数量不多。)这些族群在陆地上搜寻任何可食用的东西。当它们迁徙的消息在隧道中传播时，潘德蒙的其他居民为肯定会发生的痛苦做好准备。",
					"嚎叫者的名字很恰当，因为他们的嚎叫声以疯狂的音调划破呼啸的风。它们的叫声和大闹天宫的风有同样的效果，会逐渐把听到它们的人逼到精神错乱。每当嚎叫者放出它的叫声，所有在听觉范围内的人，不管是在室内还是室外，都必须做一个检查，就像他们被暴露在潘德蒙的风中一样。嚎叫者的哭声缺乏风的全部力量，他们的咆哮音调永远不会把一个陈腐者推到第三阶段（歇斯底里）之外。当嚎叫者唱歌时，已经达到辞世的角色会表现出他们所有的抽搐和颤抖。即使在其他星球上，嚎叫者的效果也会随着它而传播。",
					"幸运的是，嚎叫者并不是一直在海湾。在这一点上，它们更像普通的狗。当情况合适时，它们会偶尔嚎叫和热衷于此。作为群居动物，当它们与主人分开关在马厩里感到孤独时，它们会发出嚎叫。在发情期和领地受到挑战时，它们会发出嚎叫。它们在被逼无奈时也会嚎叫。DM有最终决定权，可以决定这些野兽何时向黑夜发起冲击。",

					"如果不是隧道里的人能够捕捉并驯服这些野兽，使之成为良好的骑乘和驮运坐骑，嚎叫者将只是潘德蒙的另一个祸害。嚎叫者的运载能力相当于一匹草泥马，而且比普通的马更适合在扭曲的隧道中行走。",

					"鲨鱼能感觉到水下的压力变化，最常见的是由其他生物发出的声音引起的。在水中乱动总是会吸引鲨鱼，因为通常只有受伤的鱼会有这样的行为。鲨鱼可以在一英里外感觉到这些动作，一旦一只鲨鱼发现了猎物，更多的鲨鱼很快就会跟上。鲨鱼在闻到血腥味时也会毫不留情地攻击，它们同样可以在一英里或更远的距离察觉到。",
					"当一些鲨鱼聚集在一个流血的受害者周围时，血的气味和杀戮的快感使所有的鲨鱼都陷入捕食的狂潮。没有什么能从这样的攻击中逃脱，甚至一些鲨鱼也不能。鲨鱼在捕食狂潮中吃任何活物，甚至是相互之间。由于鲨鱼移动起来，咬一口肉，然后迅速撤退，所以每一轮最多可以有四条大鲨鱼在水中攻击一个人大小的对手。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"鲨鱼是纯粹的进食和杀戮机器，很自然地进化成高级掠食者，然后在数百万年里保持不变。它们主要是清道夫，捕食病人和伤员，但如果受到诱惑，也会攻击鲜肉。它们具有很强的领地性和独居性。",
					"鲨鱼唯一的朋友是{@creature sahuagin|AGGMM3}，他们欣赏捕食者的血腥、无情和高效的天性。他们经常使用鲨鱼作为守护者、坐骑、祭品和个人宠物。据传，所有萨瓦金人的国王拥有一条最大尺寸的巨齿鲨，他显然经常喂食这条鲨鱼。萨瓦金女祭司把所有的祭品都献给了最大尺寸的纯白大白鲨，这些鲨鱼常常被装饰在金银项圈里。",
					"萨瓦金人是唯一已知的成功训练鲨鱼作为坐骑的种族，其过程是秘密的。众所周知的是，鲨鱼和它的骑手都能以惊人的敏捷性攻击同一个敌人，使这种组合成为深海中最可怕的东西之一。用来将萨瓦金战士骑在鲨鱼背上的马具显然是由一种特殊的海藻制成的，表面世界的人对此一无所知。",
					"生态学",
					"鲨鱼只有两个天然的弱点。第一个是它们的内部器官只有厚厚的、有弹性的肉质层，而不是坚硬的骨架，保护得很差。一些生物，如海豚，利用这一点，从侧面冲撞鲨鱼。由于海豚的高智商，它们是鲨鱼的唯一真正的敌人。它们是唯一的已知物种，主动猎杀这些本来非常令人恐惧和尊敬的怪物。",
					"鲨鱼也被迫在水中不断移动，以迫使足够数量的富氧水通过它们原始的鳃。因此，一条鲨鱼如果被关押了{@dice 1d4+1}小时不动，就会死于窒息。"

The conjurer retains full command of the stalker until it either fulfills its duties or is defeated and driven back to its home plane. Once given a task, an invisible stalker is relentless. They are faultless trackers who can detect any trail less than a day old. If ordered to attack, they will do so with great fury and will cease their efforts only upon their own destruction or the direct orders of their master. Once their mission is accomplished, the creature is free to return to its home plane.",
					"The invisible stalker is, at best, an unwilling servant. It resents any task assigned to it, although brief, uncomplicated labors may be seen as something of a diversion and thus undertaken with little resentment. Tasks that require a week or more of its time will drive the invisible stalker to pervert the stated intent of the command. Such commands must be carefully worded and come from a powerful wizard. An invisible stalker may look for a loop hole in the command as a means of striking back at its master. For example, a simple command such as \"keep me safe from all harm\" may result in the stalker carrying the conjurer back to the elemental plane of air and leaving him there in a well hidden location. Each day of the invisible stalker's indenturedness there is a 1% cumulative chance that the creature will seek a means to pervert its commands and free itself of servitude. If no option is open, the creature must continue to serve.",

Those who have been subjected to great hardship, assigned very difficult tasks, or who have faced death at the hands of humanoids, tend to retain a distrust or outright hatred of them. Those that have had an easy time during past periods of service or who are first time arrivals on the Prime Material plane may be easier to deal with. Such feelings may carry over to influence encounters with humanoids traveling in the aerial plane. Anyone who has befriended an invisible stalker in the past will find that voyages through the plane of elemental Air are far less hazardous than they might otherwise have been.",
					"Invisible stalkers only obey those who actually summon them and few wizards can be commissioned to summon such a being on another's behalf. Some mercenary wizards have been able to construct the necessary summons onto scrolls that are usable by others. These sell for between 5,000 and 10,000 gp and are very dangerous to use.

					"Jackals are small, canine scavengers that roam the warm grasslands of the world. They are neither fierce nor brave, but are quite common. There are three known species of jackal in the world: asian, black-backed and side-striped. Except for their markings, these animals are very similar.",
					"The typical jackal has a narrow head and a sharp, pointed snout which looks very similar to that of a fox. In its other characteristics, however, the animal is much like a wolf or dog. Its fur is typically a tawny buff in color and quite grizzled. The tip of the animal's bushy tail is much darker, often shading to black.",
					"战斗",
					"As a rule, any jackal will flee if charged or threatened by another predator. In fact, they will even abandon their efforts at hunting if their prey turns out to have more life left in it than they expected.",
					"When a jackal does attack, it will do so by biting. Although this is not an especially fierce attack, it serves the animal well enough. Often, jackals will dart in to bite a victim and then quickly retreat to a safe distance to examine the effects of their attack. If more than one jackal is trying to bring down a particular animal, they will attack in a haphazard manner with little or no coordination of their efforts.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Jackals inhabit plains, deserts, and grasslands throughout the warmer regions of the world. During the day, when the sun is too hot for their tastes, they remain in holes which they have dug in the ground.",
					"At night, they come out to hunt. Although they usually search for prey in pairs, they can be encountered in small groups of up to six individuals. Jackals are loath to attack healthy animals who might be able to harm them. Rather, they will stalk only those too feeble (either old, young, sick, or injured) to put up much of a fight. Carrion is a regular part of the jackal's diet, as are occasional pieces of fruit.",
					"Whenever a jackal is afoot, it habitually utters its piercing cry. Known as a pheal, this frightening sound can be heard for quite a distance and is often far more terrifying than the animal itself. Herbivores (including domesticated ones) will tend to become frightened by the pheal of a jackal. There is a 10% chance per jackal that the howling will cause a herd of herbivores to panic and attempt to flee. Horses and similar animals can be calmed by their keepers with a DC 8 Animal Handling skill check.",
					"Despite its less-than-dangerous nature, the jackal plays a dark and mysterious role in the mythos of various human cultures. Their place as carrion eaters and killers of the defenseless has earned them a reputation for cruelty and evil deeds which is wholly undeserved. Jackal attacks on humans anf other humanoids are few and far between. In many regions which are frequented by jackals, numerous horror stories will be told about the doings of jackals but, oddly enough, further investigation will usually show that these are second hand reports of questionable origin.",
					"生态学",
					"Jackals are reluctant predators and their position in the food chain is that of a scavenger rather than a hunter. By hunting and killing sick or weak animals, they play an important part in the process of natural selection. In addition, the carrion which they consume, would otherwise rot and become a potential health hazard and breeding ground for disease.",
					"In those places where they share territory with men, it is quite common for jackals to interbreed with domesticated dogs. Further, both the pups born to such a mating and adult wild jackals are easily domesticated. Thus, although they are not fierce enough to act as guards or hunting animals, they are often found in human communities near their lands as pets.",
					"Young, wild, or domesticated jackals are seldom available on the commercial market, however, and are worth little when offered for sale."

					"描述",
					"The jackalwere is a terrible and savage creature which preys on unsuspecting travelers and other demihumans that it can ambush. Its ability to alter its shape at will makes it a most dangerous foe.",
					"The jackalwere can be found in any of three forms, showing no preference for any one over the others. The first of these is that of a normal jackal. In this form it will often run and hunt with jackal packs. Its second form is a six foot tall, half-human/half-jackal hybrid which stands erect. In its third form, the jackalwere is physically indistinguishable from normal human beings. The exact physical characteristics of the jackalwere's human form varies according to the desires of the monster.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"When the jackalwere locates a victim it will assume human shape and approach its prey. It will seek to ease the suspicions of its target, often pretending to be injured or otherwise in need, until it can employ its gaze attack. If this fails and the jackalwere is confronted with forceful resistance it will decide whether to flee or press the attack based on its estimation of its victim's strength.",
					"The jackalwere spends its life hunting and killing any humans and demihumans it comes across. They roam the world in either the jackal or human form, seeking humanoids to kill, eat, and rob. They are sly creatures and masters of deceit.",
					"Jackalweres are able to mate only in their jackal form. They may produce offspring either by mating with true jackals or other jackalweres, but only those young who were not of mixed blood will be jackalweres themselves. The children of a jackal and jackalwere mating will be jackals, although they will be unnaturally aggressive.",
					"Female jackalweres give birth in five months to a litter of 1d4 pups. These are identical to jackal pups although they initially have 1 Hit Die. The pups grow quickly and add an additional Hit Die each year. Their jackal forms reach full growth at three years and pups are locked in that form for their first two years. At age two they gain the ability to assume their hybrid form and at age three they gain the ability to assume a human form which is apparently nine years of age. The human form grows at triple the normal human rate. If a parent in human form is discovered with its pups, it will often try to pass them off as pets.",
					"Jackalweres may travel in the company of 1d6 normal jackals. Although these jackals are normal in every regard, the influence of the jackalwere tends to make them more fierce than normal. Jackals under the influence of a jackalwere will be hunters instead of scavengers.",

					"The jann are the weakest of the elemental humanoids known collectively as genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Prime Material Plane. In addition to speaking common and all the languages of genies,jann can speak with animals.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Jann favor forlorn deserts and hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety. Jann society is very open, and males and females are regarded as equals. A tribe is made up of 1d20 + 10 individuals and is ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers.",
					"Exceptionally powerful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in time of need they gather and command large forces of jann (and sometimes allied humans).",
					"Many jann tribes are nomadic, traveling with flocks of camels, goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis.",
					"These itinerant jann appear human in every respect, and are often mistaken for them, unless they are attacked. Jann are strong and courageous, and they do not take kindly to insult or injury The territory of a jann tribe can extend hundreds of miles in any direction.",
					"While travelling, male jann live in large, colorful tents with their wives and married male children, and their families. Married daughters move away to live with their new husbands. When a family eventually grows large enough that it can no longer reside comfortably in the tent, a new tent is built, and a son takes his wife and family with him to this new dwelling.",
					"At permanent oases, the jann live not only in tents, but also in elegantly styled structures built from materials brought from any of the elemental planes.",
					"Jann are able to dwell in air, earth, fire, or water environments for up to 48 hours. This includes the elemental planes, to which any janni can travel, even taking up to six individuals along if those others hold hands in a circle with the janni.",
					"Failure to return to the Prime Material plane within 48 hours inflicts 1 point of damage per additional hour on the jann, until the jann dies or return to the Prime Material plane.",
					"Travel to another elemental plane is possible, withaut damage, providing at least two days are spent on the Prime Material plane immediately prior to the travel.",
					"生态学",
					"Jann are suspicious of humans, dislike demihumans, and detest humanoids. Jann accept djinn, but shun dao, efreet, and marids. They sometimes befriend humans or work with them for a desired reward, like potent magical items.",
					"One ethic the jann share with other nomads is the cultural demand for treating guests with honor and respect. Innocent visitors (including humans) are treated hospitably during their stay but some day might be expected to return the favor."

					"Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to annoy and inconvenience the human and demihuman races.",
					"The typical kenku resembles a humanoid crow wearing human clothing, but other shapes of kenku are known to exist. Kenku have both arms and wings. The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a distance for a large backpack. Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet. The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face markings. The eyes are a brilliant yellow.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Kenku are a secretive race that lives among the human and demihuman races without the bulk of the population ever being aware of their presence.",
					"If a group of kenku is encountered, the group's size determines its composition. A group of five or fewer contains two 4-Hit Dice and three 5-Hit Dice kenku. A group of six or seven has a leader with 6 Hit Dice, three kenku with 4 Hit Dice, and the rest have 3 Hit Dice. A group of eight kenku adds a supreme leader of 7 Hit Dice.",
					"Kenku do not speak; although they may give out bird-like squawks, these are gibberish. They are adept at symbols, sign language, and pantomime.",
					"Kenku may appear to be friendly, helpful, and even generous. They freely give treasure to humans and demihumans, but it is rarely genuine and crumbles into dust within a day. They may offer nonverbal advice to humanoids, but this is carefully designed to mislead. It may actually lead the party into dangers and difficulties they might otherwise have avoided.",
					"The actual structure of kenku society is elusive. The kenku themselves either refuse to comment or lie. Those kenku lairs that have been encountered tend to be small underground chambers or cave complexes. It is believed that large caverns deep underground may hold sizeable kenku communities, including individuals of 8 Hit Dice or more and with greater magical powers.",
					"Kenku reproduction is similar to that of large birds. The female lays a clutch of two to four eggs that hatch after 60 days. New hatchlings are featherless, helpless, and have 1 hit point each. Hatchlings grow swiftly and gain 1 hit point each month. Within six to eight months they have adult feathers and are able to function independently as 1-Hit Die kenku. At this point they can begin to learn to use the skills they need as adults (thieving, fighting, disguise).",
					"Younger kenku (3 Hit Dice or less) are reckless and prone to audacious plans. They have been known to pass themselves off as gods and collect the worshipers's offerings. Older kenku are more reserved and cunning, preferring to kidnap wealthy humans and demihumans as a source of revenue.",
					"生态学",
					"Domestically raised kenku are prized as servants. Kenku eggs are commonly sold for 250 gp, hatchlings for 300-500 gp. However, this is a form of slave trade, with all the attendant complications. If a kenku discovers captive kenku, it will attempt to secretly rescue the captive and, if possible, kidnap the slave trader or owner. They will avenge slain kenku."

					"The killer whale's diet consists of both fish and warm-blooded animals. It is a crafty hunter that can recognize the shadows and sounds made by animals atop ice floes. It will break through the ice to visually confirm the presence of prey. Smaller ice floes are rammed and shattered to force the prey into the water. When the killer whale smashes into the ice, every being on the ice must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation. Failure means the being has slipped into the water and can be attacked the following round.",

Such sites are virtually impossible to reach without resort to flight or climbing. The lairs may have an stony exterior crafted from local materials. It is enhanced by magically created wood and stout cloth. The interiors tend to be luxurious. The ki-rin are able to craft fine cloth, tapestries, pillows, and other comforts. An occupied lair is kept clean by carefully controlled winds that sweep out debris.",

					"Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white.",
					"Because of the kobolds' fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and",
					"tenacity.",
					"Kobolds speak their own language; some (75%) speak orc and goblin.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Kobolds live in dark, damp places underground and in overgrown forests. They can be found in almost any climate. As kobolds are good miners, any area with potential for mining is fair game for settlement.",
					"The average kobold tribe has 40 \u2013 400 (4d10x10) adult males. For every 40 kobolds in a band there will be one leader and two bodyguards. In a lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) bodyguards, females equal to 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of the males and 30-300 (3d10x10) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-8 guards.",
					"Further, there is a 65% chance there will be guard animals: (70%) 2-5 wild boars or (30%) 1-4 giant weasels. There may be one or more shamans.",
					"Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into war bands based on specific clans. As many as 10 families can be part of a clan, and each clan usually is responsible for controlling the area in a 10 mile radius from the lair.",
					"Kobolds recover treasure from the bodies of their victims and often carry them back to their lair as food. In some instances, kobolds will not kill their victims, but will sell them as slaves. Kobolds are distrustful of strangers.",
					"They hate brownies, pixies, sprites and gnomes. Gnomes are never eaten or taken prisoner.",
					"生态学",
					"Perhaps kobolds are so cruel because they are easy prey for larger humanoids and hungry monsters. They have many enemies, and even the dwarves have had to admit that the numerous kobold-goblin wars have kept the number of goblins down to a safe level. Kobolds can live 135 years."

Because the kobolds' deity remains imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use divine magic, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or take advantage of a captor."

					"描述",
					"When wandering through the world's sylvan forests, travelers should be wary of music and laughter coming from a clearing. More than likely, the cause is the dance-loving korred, a race that is close to nature and jealously protects its way of life.",
					"Perhaps the most striking feature of this gnome-sized race of humanoids is their wildly flowing beards and hair, which seem to snake out in all directions. Their bodies are hairy, with their lower quarters being those of a goat. The korred wear little, usually only a pair of leather britches. Korred smell like pine trees and fresh earth after a spring rainstorm. A stout oaken cudgel is the favored weapon and no korred is seen without his large leather pouches.",
					"They speak their own language and often know the satyr, dryad, centaur, and elf tongues. On rare occasions (10%), a korred may be found who can speak the secret language of the druids. Being a boisterous folk, they usually shout when they talk.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Wooded hills and sylvan settings are favored by the korred, who usually lair in caves or burrows. The korred are clannish, using the word \"clan\" as a title (for example, Clan Korefyr). In keeping with their chaotic nature, they do not have structured communities. Typically, there are 1-4 adults and 2-8 (2d4) children per family with 2-8 (2d4) families being part of each individual clan. These families are scattered throughout an area of roughly five miles.",
					"In respect of nature, korred are mostly herbivores, though at times they are known to indulge in some game, especially if plants are scarce, as is the case during winter. Korred are reclusive and do not tolerate outsiders, the only possible exception being rangers, druids, and elves. Even then, the stranger must be sure not to interrupt a korred celebration or dance. Satyrs are well-received by korred, and it is not unusual to see a celebration with korred, satyrs and dryads.",
					"Each week the korred have a holiday where they dance and play music using pipes, drums and harps. Those who interrupt the dance must save versus spell or dance themselves, losing 1-4 hit points per round until they are dead, restrained, or the korred flee.",
					"The korred pouches contain hair (for weaving their ropes), shears, and other items. These items will turn to gold if sprinkled with holy water (5d4×10 gp value). No korred will voluntarily give up this pouch.",
					"There is much debate among sages and scholars as to the korred's purpose in life. It seems to be to dance, sing, celebrate, and build strange things out of stone. They are rumored to have built the druid stone circles. They love nature and freedom and often take it upon themselves to preserve both if threatened.",
					"生态学",
					"This magical race is sought out for the creation of several magical items. Their hair is a key ingredient for {@i ropes of entangling} and {@i nets of snaring}. The fermented fruit beverages which the korred consume can also be used as a component for {@i love philters} and {@i potions of human control}."

					"描述",
					"Kuo-toa are an ancient race of fish-men that dwells underground and harbors a deep hatred of surface dwellers and sunlight.",
					"A kuo-toan presents a cold and horrible appearance. A typical specimen looks much like a human body, albeit a paunchy one, covered in scales and topped with a fish's head.",
					"The huge fish eyes tend to swivel in different directions when observing an area or creature. The hands and feet are very long, with three fingers and an opposing digit, partially webbed.",
					"The legs and arms are short for the body size. Its coloration is pale grey, with undertones of tan or yellow in males only. The skin has a sheen from its slimy covering.",
					"The color darkens when the kuo-toan is angry and pales when it is badly frightened. A strong odor of dead fish follows it around.",
					"It wears no clothing, only leather harnesses for its weapons and gear. Typically, a kuo-toan warrior carries daggers, spears, shields, harpoons and weighted throwing nets.",
					"Kuo-toa speak the strange subterranean trade language common to most intelligent underworld dwellers. Additionally, they speak their own arcane tongue and have empathic contact with most fish.",
					"Their religious speech is a corruption of the language used on the elemental plane of Water; if a kuo-toan cleric is in a group of kuo-toa, it is 75% unlikely that a creature native to the plane of Water will attack, for the priest will request mercy in the name of the Sea Mother, Blibdoolpoolp.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"These creatures normally travel in well-armed bands. If more than 20 kuo-toa are encountered, it is 50% likely that they are within 1d6 miles of their lair. For every four normal warriors encountered there is an additional fighter of 3rd or 4th level.",
					"For every eight normal fighters there is an additional fighter of 5th or 6th level. For every 12 normal kuo-toa in the group there is a cleric/thief of 1d4+3 levels each. If more than 20 normal fighters are encountered, the group is a war consisting of the following:",
					"One 10th-level fighter as Captain",
					"Two 8th-level fighters as Lieutenants",
					"Four 3rd/3rd-level fighter/thief Whips",
					"One Monitor (see below)",
					"One slave per four kuo-toa",
					"Kuo-toa spawn as do fish, and hatchlings, or fingerlings as they call their young, are raised in pools until their amphibian qualities develop, about one year after hatching.",
					"The young, now a foot or so high, are then able to breathe air and they are raised in pens according to their sex and fitness. There are no families, as we know them, in kuo-toan society.",
					"Especially fit fingerlings, usually of noble spawning, are trained for the priesthood as priests, priest/thieves, or special celibate monks. The latter are called monitors whose role is to control the community members who become violent or go insane. The monitor is capable of attacking to subdue or kill.",
					"Subdued creatures cannot be larger than eight feet tall and 500 pounds. Subduing attacks cause only half real damage, but when the points of damage inflicted equal the victim's total, the creature is rendered unconscious for 3d4 rounds.",
					"Kuo-toan communities do not generally cooperate, though they have special places of worship in common. These places are usually for intergroup trade, councils, and worship of the Sea Mother, so they are open to all kuo-toa.",
					"These religious communities, as well as other settlements, are open to drow and their servants, for the dark elves provide useful goods and services, though the drow are both feared and hated by the kuo-toa.",
					"This leads to many minor skirmishes and frequent kidnappings between the peoples. The illithids (mind flayers) are greatly hated by the kuo-toa and they and their allies are attacked on sight.",
					"The ancient kuo-toa once inhabited the shores and islands of the upper world, but as the race of mankind grew more numerous and powerful, these men-fish were slowly driven to remote regions.",
					"Continual warfare upon these evil, human-sacrificing creatures threatened to exterminate the species, for a number of powerful beings were aiding mankind, their sworn enemies.",
					"Some kuo-toa sought refuge in sea caverns and secret subter-ranean waters, and while their fellows were being slaughtered, these few prospered and developed new powers to adapt to their lightless habitat.",
					"The seas contained other fierce and evil creatures, however, and the deep-dwelling kuo-toa were eventually wiped out, leaving only those in the underworld to carry on, unnoticed and eventually forgotten by mankind. But the remaining kuo-toa have not forgotten mankind, and woe to any who fall into their slimy clutches.",
					"Now the kuo-toa are haters of sunlight and are almost never encountered on the earth's surface. This, and their inborn hatred of discipline, prevent the resurgence of these creatures, for they have become numerous once again and acquired new powers.",
					"However, they have also become somewhat unstable, possibly as a result of inbreeding, and insanity is common among the species.",
					"If a kuo-toan lair is found, it contains 4d10 x 10 2nd-level fighters. In addition, there are higher level fighters in the same ratio as noted for wandering groups. The leader of the group is one of the following, depending on the lair's population:",
					"A cleric/rogue king of 12/14th level, if 350 or more normal kuo-toa are present",
					"{@b or}",
					"A cleric/rogue prince of 11/13th level, if 275-349 normal kuo-toa are present",
					"{@b or}",
					"A cleric/rogue duke of 10/12th level, if fewer than 275 normal kuo-toa are present.",
					"There are also the following additional kuo-toa in the lair:",
					"Eight Eyes of the cleric leader \u2014 6th- to 8th-level cleric/rogue",
					"One Chief Whip \u2014 6th/6th-level fighter/rogue",
					"Two Whips of 4th/4th or 5th/5th level (see whip description)",
					"One Monitor per 20 2nd-level kuo-toa",
					"Females equal to 20% of the male population",
					"Young (noncombatant) equal to 20% of the total kuo-toa",
					"Slaves equal to 50% of the total male population",
					"In special religious areas there are also a number of kuo-toan priests. For every 20 kuo-toa in the community there is a 3rd-level priest, for every 40 there is a 4th-level priest, for every 80 there is a 5th-level priest, all in addition to the others. These priests are headed by one of the following groups:",
					"One 6th-level cleric if the group is 160 or fewer",
					"{@b or}",
					"One 7th-level and one 6th-level cleric if the group is between 161 and 240",
					"{@b or}",

The smell of animals, decomposing on a hot humid day follows the leucrotta, and its breath is especially bad.",

					"Since the leucrotta is not a very social creature, all strangers are nothing more than sources of food. Sometimes, a powerful chaotic evil person may entrap a leucrotta and force it to serve as a guardian, but such beasts rebel at the first opportunity.",
					"Those brave enough to venture into a leucrotta lair must first roll a successful saving throw vs. poison with a -1 penalty, due to the horrendous stench, or gag helplessly for 1d4 rounds. Once inside, the money and possessions of past victims await.",

They serve no practical use and one would be hard pressed to find a druid that would try to protect a member of this species. Some sages speculate that the leucrotta is an unnatural abnormality, an aberration spawned by some demented power or archmage.",

The lich can see with normal vision in even the darkest of environments but is unaffected by even the brightest light. An aura of cold and darkness radiates from the lich which makes it an ominous and fearsome sight. They were originally wizards of at least 18th level.",
					"Liches are often (75%) garbed in the rich clothes of nobility. If not so attired, the lich will be found in the robes of its former profession. In either case, the clothes will be tattered and rotting with a 25% chance of being magical in some way.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Liches are usually solitary creatures. They have cast aside their places as living beings by choice and now want as little to do with the world of men as possible. From time to time, however, a lich's interest in the world at large may be reawakened by some great event of personal importance.",
					"A lich will make its home in some ominous fortified area, often a strong keep or vast subterranean crypt.",
					"When a lich does decide to become involved with the world beyond its lair, its keen intelligence makes it a dangerous adversary. In some cases, a lich will depend on its magical powers to accomplish its goals. If this is not sufficient, however, the lich is quite capable of animating a force of undead troops to act on its behalf. If such is the case, the lich's endless patience and cunning more than make up for the inherent disadvantages of the lesser forms of undead which it commands.",
					"Although the lich has no interest in good or evil as we understand it, the creature will do whatever it must to further its own causes. Since it feels that the living are of little importance, the lich is often viewed as evil by those who encounter it. In rare cases, liches of a most unusual nature can be found which are of any alignment.",
					"The lich can exist for centuries without change. Its will drives it onward to master new magics and harness mystical powers not available to it in its previous life. So obsessed does the monster become with its quest for power that it often forgets its former existence utterly. Few liches call themselves by their old names when the years have drained the last vestiges of their humanity from them. Instead, they often adopt pseudonyms like \"the Black Hand\" or \"the Forgotten King.\" Learning the true name of a lich is rumored to confer power over the creature.",
					"生态学",
					"The lich is not a thing of this world. Although it was once a living creature, it has entered into an unnatural existence.",
					"In order to become a lich, the wizard must prepare its phylactery by the use of the {@spell enchant an item}, {@spell magic jar}, {@spell permanency} and {@spell reincarnation} spells. The phylactery, which can be almost any manner of object, must be of the finest craftsmanship and materials with a value of not less than 1,500 gold pieces per level of the wizard. Once this object is created, the would-be lich must craft a potion of extreme toxicity, which is then enchanted with the following spells: {@spell wraithform}, {@spell permanency}, {@spell cone of cold}, {@spell feign death}, and {@spell animate dead}. When next the moon is full, the potion is imbibed. Rather than death, the potion causes the wizard to undergo a transformation into its new state. A system shock survival throw is required, with failure indicating an error in the creation of the potion which kills the wizard and renders him forever dead.",

					"Living steel usually appears as a humanoid mass of pure, shining steel, almost liquid in its motions. It reflects bright light and absorbs heat; to those with infravision, it appears as a cold blue lump. Although it is not normally an aggressive opponent, living steel can be ferocious when aroused, and it will track its enemies mercilessly until it or they are dead.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Living steel has no known society. Solitary creatures all their lives, they reproduce asexually. If two living steels encounter one another, they battle to the death. The one with the most inventive and damaging shapes is usually the victor, consuming the loser and adding the vanquished creature to its own mass.",
					"These creatures lair in small nooks in the rock, usually with only a thin crack as access. Only in their lairs do they relax the forms they have chosen, and here they appear as formless blobs of fine steel.",
					"生态学",
					"Living steel survives only through a diet of iron. It is therefore generally found only near veins of iron ore or in regions where iron is otherwise available in abundance. Most of the iron is burned off to power the creature's movements, but the steel drops a small, refined portion of it in its lair at the end of each day.",
					"This mass is an embryonic living steel, and it becomes sentient and mobile after one year of this refining, provided the steel has daily access to a vein of ore.",
					"Living Steel is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Longstrider}"

					"Magmen are creatures of the Paraelemental Plane of Magma. They stand 3 feet tall and are glowing, humanoid creatures, much like fire-cloaked gnomes or goblins. Small puffs of flame constantly burst from their skin, as if they are perspiring kerosene that ignites when enough accumulates. Magmen radiate heat like small bonfires, rendering the area near them quite uncomfortable to most nonfire-loving creatures. Their faces are almost always twisted with malicious glee.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Magmen are creatures of the Paraelemental Plane of Magma, and as such they have no society on other planes. When they appear outside their own fiery lands, their sole preoccupation seems to be with having fun... by their standards. Magmen love flame and are fascinated with burning things. Were it not for the damage their curiosity causes, their childlike pleasure might almost be touching or amusing. Somehow, it never occurs to these creatures (or if it does, they perversely ignore it) that other creatures might actually be hurt by their actions. Having come from an environment of fire, the panic-stricken reaction of Prime Material creatures who are set afire seems merely comical to them, almost slapstick. Perhaps this is because the association of pain and fire is utterly foreign to their kind.",
					"On their own plane, magmen live as hunter-gatherers. They band in small tribes, organized around a single extended \"colony\". (Colony is the only apt word, for magmen have no sexes, reproducing by simple division as they grow.) Each tribe is led by the eldest magman. They scour the molten plain, looking for choice bits of flaming minerals or hunting other elemental creatures.",
					"Occasionally, magmen pass into other Inner Planes or the Prime Material Plane through gaps created by the excessive heat and pressure of subterranean lava. These portals have a strong lure to the magmen, for the molten stone of such gaps has a different \"taste\" than that of their home. Magmen enter into the vortex to sample the essence, and they are invariably drawn through the portal and into the other plane. Some sages speculate that the strange minerals of these portals may have an intoxicating effect on the little creatures. This would certainly account for their frivolous behavior outside of their plane.",
					"Magmen can reach the Outer Planes only if they are summoned. Their mischievous and destructive natures provide perverse amusement to {@creature tanar'ri|AGGMM4} and {@creature baatezu|AGGMM}, and these fiends sometimes keep magmen captive in special molten pools. Magmen are sometimes summoned into the midst of enemy ranks in the Gray Waste, Gehenna, and Carceri, providing diversionary attacks in the never-ending Blood War. Militarily, they are good for little more than this, since their flightiness and cowardice make them unsuitable for pitched combat.",
					"Magmen especially like to swim around in active volcanoes, for when these erupt, the magmen are released to engage in their favorite sport of igniting all the combustible materials they can reach. Magmen can remain out of lava or some other fiery habitat for a maximum of six hours before they stiffen and become immobile. They rarely remain away from their environment for more than two or three hours at a time, as they consider anything below 1,000°F to be uncomfortably cold.",
					"生态学",
					"Most sages and travelers guess that magmen eat choice morsels of molten rock, although it is possible that they absorb much of their nutrients directly through the skin.",
					"Upon occasion, a wizard will summon a magman to fire a furnace for a magical procedure, but wise wizards return the little troublemaker as soon as the need has passed. Some are tempted to trap the creatures and let them cool, since magmen statuettes are sometimes collected as garden ornaments for the wealthy. However, imminent death makes the little beings hostile and dangerous, and more than a few city blocks have been destroyed in their attempted escapes.",

If brought to a battle, however, they make excellent soldiers; once they see the enemy, they attack tirelessly. Sometimes they attack even when such a tactic does not favor their army, but such is war in the Abyss.",

Those who were particularly cruel and evil in life are confined to the Pits of Despair on the 400th layer of the Abyss. Of this place, wizards and sages know only the name, because none have ever seen it. The Pits are thought to be hidden beneath the Mountain of Woe, but again, little is known.",

					"The manticore stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 15 feet in length. It has a 25-foot wingspan.",
					"Each section of the manticore closely resembles the creature it imitates. The leonine torso has a tawny hide, the mane is a lion's brown-black color, and the batlike wings are a dark brown with sparse hair. All manticores have heads that resemble humanoid males; the mane resembles a heavy beard and long hair.",
					"战斗",
					"The manticore first fires a volley of tail spikes. Next, the manticore closes with its prey and attacks with its front claws and sharp teeth. In an outdoor setting, the manticore tries to stay in the air to minimize its chance of being attacked. It is a clumsy flier, however, and cannot use its teeth in the air.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Manticores are found in any climate but prefer warm lands to cool ones. This reflects the wide climate range of their favorite food, humans. A manticore's territory may cover 20 or more square miles and includes at least one human settlement.",
					"Such territories usually overlap with those of other manticores and other man-eating predators like dragons.",
					"Manticores mate for life. The male remains with the female during gestation and hunts for her. Manticores bear one or two cubs which grow rapidly to adulthood in five years.",
					"Cubs are born with 1 Hit Die and gain an additional one each year. In their first year, cubs lack flying ability, but they are still small enough for an adult to grasp in its forelegs.",
					"There is a 20% chance a she-manticore's lair holds cubs under one year old. Cubs up to two years inflict one point of damage per front paw and 1-2 points with their bite. Cubs 3-4 years old inflict 1-2, 1-2, and 1-6 points of damage.",
					"Manticore cubs can be caught and trained to assist evil humans. Such training is difficult and dangerous, especially since domesticated adults have an 80% chance of reverting to a wild state. Manticores will not allow themselves to be used as mounts.",
					"Wild adults may voluntarily ally themselves with evil humans, provided such allies can provide them with a steady, ample food supply. Manticores normally eat their prey where they kill it.",
					"Males sometimes haul slain prey back to their mates or drag still-living prey to their lairs for the cubs to practice killing.",
					"Manticores collect their victims' valuables for a variety of reasons, including curiosity, emulation of other monsters who collect treasure, the man-scent on the things, or because they know humans value the things and therefore might come looking for them.",
					"Their lack of real hands prevents most manticores from using what magical items fall into their possession. However, manticores that have allied with evil humans may possess magical items designed specifically for their use. Examples include magical collars or bracelets that are, in effect, oversized magical rings.",
					"生态学",
					"Manticores are wide-ranging carnivores that have successfully survived in every region inhabited by humans, whether in the wilderness or underground. They are nightmarish opponents but invaluable allies if conditions are right.",
					"A manticore's pelt is a mark of the most powerful hunters and warriors. An intact, cured manticore hide complete with wings is worth 10,000 gp."

Marids consider it a capital offense for a lesser being to offend a marid. Marids are both fiercely independent and extremely egoistical.",

Maurezhi prey on mortals, spreading chaos and evil through their fearsome appetites. Like the nabassu, maurezhi gain strength with each mortal they devour \u2014 but instead of absorbing mortal life forces, the maurezhi feed upon corpses, stealing portions of their victims' memories, skills, and appearance.",
					"A maurezhi hears a strong resemblance to a common ghoul. Its posture is hunched and feral, its skin gray and leathery, and its hands filthy talons. The maurezhi's face slopes into a short, fang-filled muzzle, and its ears are catlike. Maurezhi leap and caper in sudden, unpredictable movements when excited or angered. They can communicate by means of telepathy, but the only sounds their rattling bone-boxes can make're gibbering howls, grunts, and shrieks.",
					"Maurezhi seek opportunities to slay and devour mortals wherever they can find 'em. Most maurezhi're doomed to serve as marauders and skirmishers in the Blood War, but a few find ways to escape onto the Outlands or the Prime and begin a career of bloody murders and vile feasts.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Maurezhi live only to consume the most powerful and intelligent mortals they can find. They're especially fond of waylaying lone travelers or adventurers, consuming them, and then assuming their appearance and using their acquaintances to seek out another victim while concealing the disappearance of the previous one. Between suitable victims, maurezhi're fond of haunting graveyards and barrows, sating their taste for the flesh of mortals.",
					"Most maurezhi aren't given much of a chance to begin their growth in this fashion, though. They're frequently recruited by the babaus or hezrous and sent to fight in the Blood War. In the Abyss, a typical maurezhi's never had the chance to consume a human. However, a small percentage of maurezhi encountered in the Abyss will be full-grown creatures that've completed their expedition and returned to the Abyss at the peak of their power. These tanar'ri function as assassins and spies, roaming the Lower Planes to keep an eye on the baatezu war efforts.",
					"生态学",
					"Although maurezhi devour all kinds of carrion and corpses on a daily basis, this doesn't increase their power. To consume a corpse, the maurezhi must personally kill the victim and devour him or her within one turn (10 minutes) of the murder. The grisly process requires no less than half an hour, and if the fiends interrupted, it can't completely consume its prey. A character who's been thus consumed can't he raised or resurrected, and can be returned to life only with a very carefully worded {@spell wish}."

Such homes are appallingly dirty. Each meazel's possessions are gathered into a pile that also serves as the creatures bed. Rats and insects overrun the mess, polish off the leftovers, and also serve as snacks.",
					"Only two things make meazels congregate willingly: the need for cooperation against a foe, and the infrequent urge to mate. Meazel females give birth to one or two whelps. The whelps are independent at three years and mature in six years. The whelps are incapable of being tamed even if captured at birth and raised in a kind environment, the whelps still grow malevolent although probably more intelligent and cunning.",
					"Meazels are too mean-spirited to make reliable allies. However, they occasionally can he duped into acting as unwitting pawns or recruited against a common foe.",
					"Meazels are greedy and will strip a corpse of anything they find valuable. However, they either do not understand or recognize magical items as valuable, hence such items are not generally found in meazel hoards. On the other hand, they might grab items that they are unable to use properly, such as human armor or large weapons. The bones of past meals are ofteb stored in sacks near the meazels' lair. The sacks also contain any gemy that the creatures may have found among their victims' possessions. Meazels do not recognize gems and semiprecious stones as treasure, hence they throw these away. Most of their treasure is coinage, silver and gold.",
					"生态学",
					"Meazels prey on anything that roams the subterranean realms. They are carnivorous and prefer humanoid flesh. Meazels prey mainly on orcs and kobolds, although they galdy attack anyone else who is available. Because of this, almost any subterranean dwellers attack a meazel on sight. Meazels are unique in that hatred of them unites virtually all other subterranean travelers."

					"Medusae are female humanoids with hair of swarming snakes. They are hateful creatures that can petrify any creature that meets their gaze.",
					"The typical medusa has a pale-skinned, very shapely woman's form. It stands 5 to 6 feet tall with the snakes adding up to another foot. At distances farther than 30 feet, the medusa is easily confused with a normal woman. Its red-glowing eyes are visible up to 30 feet.",
					"At distances of 20 feet or closer, the medusa's true nature is revealed. Its face is horrible \u2014 the snakes writhe constantly, especially if the medusa is excited.",
					"Medusae wear human clothing such as loose dresses or robes.",
					"They seldom wear armor and cannot easily wear helmets. Medusae may carry a knife, dagger, or short bow. Medusae speak their own tongue and the common one.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Medusae dwell in dark caves or the lower regions of large abandoned buildings. They arrange the lighting such that their homes are filled with flickering shadows.",
					"The presence of petrified victims is a sure indicator of the occupant's true nature.",
					"For this, aesthetic, and other reasons, the medusa usually removes most of its victims. Those that resemble interesting statues may be retained; the rest are often broken into unrecognizable (and unrevivable) chunks.",
					"The one form of treasure never found in a medusa's lair is a mirror. If a medusa sees its own reflection in a mirror, it turns to stone itself. Reflection in nonmetallic reflectors such as water or polished stone have no such effect. Medusae are immune to the petrifying effect of another medusa.",
					"Medusae are infrequently driven to mate with humanoid males. The act always ends in the male's death, usually by petrification when the medusa reveals its previously hidden visage. Two to six eggs are laid one month later and hatch eight months after that. The female hatchlings appear as baby girls with stubby green tendrils.",
					"The hatchlings are revolting to look at but cannot petrify. Medusae grow at the same rate as humans. At about age two the serpentine hair becomes alive and gains its poisonous bite. The medusa can petrify with the onset of adolescence.",
					"Medusa is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Poison Spray}"

Meenlocks are squat, two feet tall, and covered in shaggy, black fur. Their bent arms end in nasty, three-clawed hands. Their heads are white and hairless, with small, toothsome mouths, flat noses, and large yellow eyes devoid of pupils. Meenlocks have a powerful telepathy ability that enables them to send messages to any creature within 300 feet. Their speech is limited to low guttural growls.",
					"战斗",
					"Any human or group of humans who open a meenlock lair without killing the monsters or replacing the stone exactly as they found it will be tracked and attacked that night. The tracking meenlocks follow at a discrete distance and use their telepathy ability to send messages to one character in the group.",
					"The messages convey the general impression to the victim that horrible monsters are in pursuit and they want to make him one of them. As the day wears on the victim becomes aware of stealthy movements all around him. Companions of the victim probably detect nothing.",
					"This mental harassment continues throughout the day. In addition, a character being harassed by meenlocks is distracted that he suffers penalties to his attacks and spells.",
					"Meenlocks attack after their victim beds down for the night. They are amazingly quiet and are very likely to surprise even watchful guards. The meenlocks try to use their fear ability and paralysis to stun any guards, then drag away their chosen victim. Meenlocks kill guards and companions if needed. They do not attack their victim unless absolutely necessary, preferring to drag him off to their lair. Once inside, after a short hideous ceremony, the victim becomes a meenlock.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Meenlocks dig their homes in desolate, rocky forests, covering the entrance with a large, flat rock (treat as a secret door). This stone opens to a twisting, vertical passageway that winds downward for 100 feet or more to the meenlock lair. The ceiling, floor, and vertical passageway of the entire lair are covered by a dank, spongy, moss unique to meenlock lairs.",
					"Meenlocks use this moss to climb up and down the vertical passage. Anyone opening the lair senses powerful emanations of evil coming from below. In addition, anyone peering into the blackness is greeted by the smell of rotting corpses. Both of these sensations are telepathic warnings from the meenlocks below.",
					"The meenlocks live in a dreary chamber at the bottom of the vertical passageway. Decorations consist of ratty sleeping furs, a number of wicked curved knives hanging on the walls, and a jumbled pile of bones.",
					"生态学",
					"Meenlocks delight in transforming humans and demihumans into monsters like themselves. Little is known about the procedure, but apparently it involves a reduction in the victim's bulk followed by quick application of the meenlock moss.",
					"A meenlock band contains a maximum of five individuals. If a sixth human is transformed, then the band splits. The three largest meenlocks (those with the most hit points) remain in the lair, while the three smaller meenlocks leave to construct their own lair."

The thin, gray, pale-eyed humanoids are easily identified by their skeletal faces, somber hooded robes, and eyes that glow red when they are angry. They are a cold species, mercenary at heart, like all yugoloths. They are telepathic and, in addition to speaking all languages, maintain mental contact with others of their race at all times.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Marraenoloths are unique among the yugoloths in that they havy an established task: They are boatmen who pilot small skiffs on the black waters of the River Styx. Unlike many other fiends, the marraenoloths can pass from plane to plane without arousing suspicion in the minds of others. They are ferrymen and ferrymen only. Other fiends would love to subvert the marraenoloths to spy on their Blood War enemies, but these creatures are only concerned with their passengers.",
					"Marraenoloths have an innate understanding of the twists and bends of the River Styx's channels, so they never get lost (unless it's convenient to do so). These creatures also can pilot their crafts through the Astral Plane and to the boundary of the Prime Material Plane. They can actually enter the Prime Material, too, but they must leave their skiffs behind. A marraenoloth without a vessel is lost and useless, so they are naturally reluctant to venture far from their crafts. Occasionally they are summoned or sent to the Prime, anyway, to transport some being to or from the Lower Planes (using a special plane shift ability that work for this task only).",
					"Marraenoloths carry passengers but never cargo, always demanding immediate payment for their servixes. (Greater fiends may ignore this, forcing the marraenoloth to serve them.) The may demand a magical item, a bag of 10 platinum coins, or two gems of 50 gp value (or more). If not paid, the marraenoloth will seek to prevent the would-be passenger from entering its boat, and it will teleport itself and its craft away at the first opportunity.",
					"Even if a marraenoloth is paid (as opposed to being sent by a higher evil force), there is still a 15% chance that the creature will betray the passenger, either by delivering him to the incorrect destination or plane (85% chance) or by leading the summoner into an ambush (15% chance). This chance of betrayal can be reduced by making additional contributions to the marraenoloth's hoard (-5% per additional payment listed above).",
					"Since all marraenoloths are aware of each other, all know of any person who cheats or harms anyone of their kind. They won't come to each other's aid (that would indicate concern for their fellows), but the identity of the transgressor is noted, and future services from any of these yugoloths will require greater payments and incur a significantly higher risk of treachery. The cheater can return to the good graces of the boatmen only by making a suitable sacrifice to all their kind. The nature of this tribute is left to the DM, but a typical one would be the surrender of rare gems or several unique magical items, presented with due ceeremony and contrition.",
					"生态学",
					"There are among the most neutral of the evil yugoloths, existing to collect their fares and nothing else. They stay clear of the politics of the Blood War. Because their skills are valuable to tanar'ri and baatezu alike, the other fiends tolerate this neutrality. As much as some infernal lord might like to subjugate them, it's understood they would no longer function properly if that happened.",
					"As a marraenoloth without its sailing duties is fairly worthless, even as a lowly foot soldier in the Blood War, no one has attempted to take control of them. However, they may unwittingly play pawns in the subtle plottings of some baatezu or tanar'ri."

The goals of a merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these power-hungry monsters seek to completely control their \"kingdoms\", often leading to attacks on intruding ships.",

These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who enter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their voracious appetites."

					"Merfolks were once human but were transformed by unknown powers into their current forms. They live by herding fish, but during times of need they attack other sea-peoples or ocean-going vessels. They live underwater but surface to sun themselves on large rocks.",
					"Adult merfolks are 5 to 6 feet long (tall) and weigh between 150 and 225 pounds. Their skin tone is fair to tan, hair color is usually dark brown (occasionally fair), while their scale color ranges from green to silver. Females are 6 inches shorter than the males and weigh between 100 to 150 pounds. Merfolks adorn themselves with coral and shell decorations.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"For every 20 merfolks encountered, there is a patrol leader with 3 HD and 1d3 barracuda. For every 40 merfolks, there is a leader with 4 HD. For every 120 merfolks encountered, there is one chief with 6 HD and two guards with 4 HD. For every ten merfolks, there is a 10% chance of a shaman (3 HD, with the spells of a 3rd-level cleric).",
					"Merfolks have regular undersea communities, usually a reef or cliff honeycombed with passages. Rarely they construct a village from sea shells and coral. An average community has between 100 and 600 males. Females and sub-adults each equal 100% of the males in a village. The communities are usually guarded by {@dice 3d6} trained {@creature barracuda|AGGMM}s.",
					"Merfolks society is heavily patriarchal. They prefer to be left to themselves and usually reject proposals of friendship or trade. They have strong territorial instincts and they have do not love surface dwelling humanoids. Males hunt and herd fish and protect their territory. Females raise children and tend to domestic affairs. Female merfolks are also known for their creativity, and they produce works of art for the community (shell carvings, seaweed tapestries, and songs).",
					"生态学",
					"Merfolks are omnivorous, but they prefer a diet of fish, lobster, crab, and shellfish. They do not cook these creatures, but must fillet them before eating. They can survive out of water for one hour before they begin to dehydrate. When dehydrated, they lose 2 hit points per hour and will die when they reach zero; immersion in fresh or salt water immediately restores these lost hit points.",
					"Merfolks have an average life expectancy of 150 years.",
					"Merfolks have many natural enemies but particularly hate the sahuagin and ixitxachitl. They often clash with tritons over territory."

					"Mimics are magically-created creatures with a hard rock-like outer shell that protects their soft inner organs. Mimics can alter their form and their pigmentation; they use this talent to lure victims into close range, where they attempt to feed on them. They usually appear in the form of treasure chests. There are two varieties, the smaller, more intelligent common mimic, and the larger, less intelligent killer mimic.",
					"Mimics are large. Common mimics occupy about 150 cubic feet (a chest, or a large door frame). Killer mimics occupy about 200 cubic feet. Mimics' natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite. Mimics can alter their pigmentation to resemble varieties of stone (such as marble), wood grain, and various metals (gold, silver, copper); it takes one round to make the desired alteration. They cannot lose mass in this transformation (they must remain the same size, though they may radically alter their dimensions).",
					"Common mimics have their own tongue (corruptions of the original language spoken by their wizard creators) and can also be taught to speak in common and other languages. Killer mimics are incapable of speech.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Mimics live underground, where they can avoid sunlight. They are solitary creatures; this is to ensure that each mimic has a large grazing area. They have no culture; their primary concerns are survival and food. Common mimics are quite intelligent and will gladly offer information in exchange for food. Killer mimics attack regardless of attempts at communication. Mimics have no moral code and no interest in culture or religion. Wizards who use them as guardians have sometimes found them to be less than enthusiastic about obeying their commands.",
					"生态学",
					"Mimics were originally created by wizards to protect themselves from treasure hunters. A good meal (one or two humans) can sustain them for weeks. They reproduce by fission and grow to full size in several years. Mimics pose as stonework, doors, statues, stairs, chests, or other common items made from stone, wood, and metal. Their skin is covered with optical sensors that are sensitive to heat and light in a 90-foot radius, even in pitch darkness. Any powerful light source can easily blind them, including direct sunlight. Along with glue, they can excrete a liquid that smells like rotting meat; this attracts smaller, more common prey (usually rats). Mimic ichor is useful in the creation of polymorph self potions, and their glue and solvent sacs can be sold to alchemists. Other internal organs are useful in the manufacture of perfumes. The mimic's internal organs are considered tasty delicacies in some cultures."

					"Flumph resemble aerial jellyfish. These odd creatures are round and almost flat, perhaps the or four inches thick in the center, tapering to one or two inches near the edge. The body is mostly hollow, much like a large cushion. A round orifices is in the center of the upper surface, flanked by two eyestalks, each about six inches long. Several short tentacles hang from the creature's underside, concealing a mass of small spikes. The tentacles closest to the flumph‘s rim can be used for fine manipulation of small objects. A common flumph is pure white in color; a monastic flumph is generally a pale yellow or green, with darker tentacles.",
					"A flumph flies by taking in air through the hole on its upper surface, and expelling it through several small holes on its underside. The creature also has several small apertures along its equator, for use in maneuvering. It usually hovers about four to six inches above the ground. Keeping its body aloft does not require great amounts of air. It creates a gentle breeze, and a slight whistling sound can be heard in a quiet area.",
					"Common flumphs cannot communicate vocally, but have a unique sign language that makes use of their tentacles and eyestalks. Some monastic flumphs, perhaps 10%, can speak and understand common or another language.",
					"战斗",
					"The flumph survives by hunting small creatures, such as rats, lizards, frogs, and the like. The flumph hovers along just above the ground, or hangs motionless in reeds or similar concealment. When it finds a small creature, it rises a foot or two, then drops onto its prey, its spikes inflicting 1d4 +2 points of piercing damage on a successful attack.",
					"In addition, the flumphs tentacles secrete digestive acids into the wounds; the acid causes an additional 1d4 points of acid damage each round. Once the prey is dead, the flumph settles on it and absorbs nutrients through its tentacles. Flumphs often need to pursue their healthier prey for a short distance before the victim dies. The acid can be washed away by complete immersion in a fast-moving stream, by actively washing the acid away (full round action) with a Create Water spell (simple immersion or rinsing will not work) or by a Lesser Restoration cast on the target.",
					"If threatened by a larger creature, the flumph usually attempts to drive it away by squirting a foul-smelling liquid from an orifice on its equator, in the front. If this method of repulsion fails, the flumph can rise to a height of 10 feet and drop onto an opponent, as if hunting.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The common flumph is a nomadic hunter, intelligent, good-aligned, and peaceful. A flumph reproduces about every two years by budding, producing 1d8 tiny flumphs on its underside.

The paintings are usually abstract, showing spirals and other curved lines, though some are vaguely representational of flumphs engaged in hunting.",

					"Of all the creatures that inhabit the deep, only the kraken exceeds the morkoth in malice and cruelty. Also known as the \"wraith of the deep\", the morkoth lurks in tunnels hoping to lure its victims into a trap from which they cannot escape.",
					"The descriptions given by those who have encountered morkoths contain considerable variation, so no one is certain what they really look like. They are usually said to resemble an intelligent fish with an octopus's beak. They are most frequently described as being between 5 to 6 feet long, inky black in color, with faint luminescent silver patches. They may have fins for arms and legs that vaguely resemble those of humans, and a number of fins for navigation and propulsion in the depths. Morkoths have infravision with a 90-foot range. They speak their own language.",
					"战斗",
					"A morkoth lives at the center of six spiraling tunnels, each of which leads to a central chamber. These tunnels are narrow (only one medium sized creature may enter at a time). As a victim passes over a tunnel, he is drawn in by a hypnotic pattern, which leads him toward the central chamber. As the victim is drawn into the central chamber, he approaches the morkoth without realizing it and must roll a successful saving throw or be charmed. A charmed victim is devoured at the morkoth's leisure. If the morkoth doesn't charm the victim before he comes within 60 feet, the hypnotic effect of the tunnels is broken.",
					"A morkoth is highly resistant to magic. It reflects any spell that is cast at it back to the caster, including spells with an area of effect. If a dispel magic is simultaneously cast with a spell, there is a chance the morkoth will be unable to reflect it, though it is entitled to a saving throw.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Morkoths are normally solitary creatures. They sometimes make alliances with kraken, offering their help in exchange for an occasional slave. If approached by evil sea humanoids for assistance, morkoths may strike a bargain but often betray their \"allies\" at the most opportune moment.",
					"Morkoths rarely leave their tunnels. The tunnels are originally natural, but are slowly carved over the course of centuries by the morkoths so that the central chamber grows larger. Morkoths sometimes build their tunnels near hot air vents, so the water in morkoth lairs may be warmer than normal.",
					"Morkoths realize that other intelligent creatures like treasure, so they collect belongings from the creatures they kill to use in bargaining with other creatures. They place no value on gold or gems or even magical items. Morkoths enjoy deception above all else. They do not enslave their victims, if only because their appetites are so fierce that slaves would not survive long.",
					"生态学",
					"According to the most popular theories, morkoths are a species of fish with human and squid influences. Sages are unsure if this species occurred by chance or design. Morkoths are carnivorous and will eat nearly any sea creature. Their usual diet is deep-water creatures such as {@creature shark|AGGMM3}s, {@creature octopi|AGGMM3}, {@creature kuo-toa|AGGMM2}s, and {@creature sahuagin|AGGMM3}. The life spans of male morkoths are about 80 to 100 years, while females die after egg-laying.",
					"Once every ten years, a morkoth leaves its tunnels and wanders the seas searching for a mate, leaving a distinctive odor trail that is easy for morkoths to identify and follow. After mating, the male morkoth returns to its tunnels and the female lays a clutch of about 25 eggs, which she buries in the ocean floor. She then dies. The eggs hatch in two months, and the immature morkoths struggle to survive, instinctively searching for vacant tunnels. Most hatchlings die on this journey.",
					"After six months, a young morkoth is mature enough to survive (it now has 2 hp/HD, for 14 hit points). It grows into a full-sized, exceptionally intelligent morkoth adult by its fifth year."

					"Mummy lords are powerful undead creatures that are usually created from the mummified remains of powerful, evil priests. This being the case, the mummy lord now draws its mystical abilities from evil powers and darkness. In rare cases, however, the mummified priests served non-evil god in life and are still granted the powers they had in life from those gods.",
					"Mummy lords often dwell in large temple complexes or tombs where they guard the bodies of the dead from the disturbances of grave robbers. Unlike normal mummies, however, they have been known to leave their tombs and strike out into the world bringing a dreadful shroud of evil down upon every land they touch.",
					"When a mummy lord wishes to create normal mummies as servants, it does so by mummifying persons infected with its rotting disease. This magical process requires 24 hours and cannot be disturbed without ruining the enchantment. Persons to be mummified are normally held or charmed so that they cannot resist the mummification process. Once the process is completed, victims are helpless to escape the bandages that bind them. If nothing happens to free them, they will die of the mummy rot just as they would have elsewhere. Upon their death, however, a strange transformation takes place. Rather than crumbling away into dust, these poor souls rise again as normal mummies. Obviously, this process is too time consuming to be used in actual combat, but the mummy lord will often attack a potential target in hopes of capturing and transforming it into a mummy. All mummies created by a mummy lord are under its telepathic command.",

					"The first of these creatures is known to have been produced by Anhktepot, the Lord of Har'akir, in the years before he became undead himself. It is believed that most, if not all, of the mumym lords mummies he created in his life were either destroyed or drawn into Ravenloft with him when he was granted a domain. A number of these creatures are believed to serve Anhktepot in his domain, acting as his agents in other lands he wishes to learn what is transpiring in other portions of Ravenloft.",
					"The process by which a mummy lord is created remains a mystery to all but Anhktepot. It is rumored that this process involves a great sacrifice to gain the favor of the gods and an oath of eternal loyalty to the Lord of Har'akir. If the latter is true, then it may lend credence to the claim of many sages that Anhktepot can command every mummy lord in existence to do his bidding. If this is indeed the case, it makes the power of this dark fiend far greater than is generally supposed."
