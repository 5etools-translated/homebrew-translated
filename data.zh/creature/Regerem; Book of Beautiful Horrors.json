In the soul of a spriggan, there is neither room nor regard for compassion or mercy, merely an uncompromising dedication to nature and vengeance that makes even the most heartfelt vows of elves or men seem trivial by comparison."

When hunting a katakan it is imperative to remember one simple fact: you will not get the drop on him and it is very likely that you are already being stalked. Katakans are invulnerable to steel, regenerate quickly, and demonstrate acute hearing. They also demonstrate an exceptionnal sense of smelling, for they are able of identifying the blood of their favorite prey over great distances, much like sharks. However, for all their strengths, katakan have one very common weakness, garlic. They find its smell simply revolting and even feel sick in its close vicinity. Much of the popular beliefs that all vampires are allergic to garlic comes from stories involving katakan."

One of the reoccuring myth states that a powerful lycanthrope that is turned into a vampire will become a katakan, or that eating a lamb killed by a lycanthrope will turn you into one.

Kinship plays a great deal on the political chessboard, as more than a few High Kings have favored their initial clan throughout their rule.

Thankfully the crown was finally reclaimed from the Northlanders and a new king chosen, but all fear this could happen again."

										"Life can be incredibly harsh and short in the misty isles, as dangers abound, and survivors are left with nothing but their grief. Many Waelan are all too familiar with the loss of loved ones and some are too ill-fitted to endure its hardship. However, suicide is rarely considered in the Waelen society, for life is a gift of the Earthmother, and very few are willing to throw it away. But there is an alternative, a darker path that that only the darkest druids are willing to discuss.",
										"A grief-stricken one seeks the druids and a funeral is held in their name at a moonwell. During the ceremony, the griefstricken drinks a decoction made of fly agaric and poison that ravages its mind, opening them to spiritual possession by a darker aspect of the goddess, Da Dhiogail, the Laughing One. During the possession they often prophesize tragedies and death that are to come. They emerge from their trance with a demented laughter, now a red fury of Da Dhiogail and vanish soon after into the wilderness.",
										"Furies are no longer who they were and the Waelen clans both revere and fear them as the bloody agents of the goddess. Most of the time red furies are not seen, but every once in a while, their, faint, tormented and hysterical laughter can be heard off in the distance. However, when the goddess demands the return of her lands and the sacrifice of foreign invaders, they come out of their deep woods and rugged valleys. When the task is done, they once again melt into the surrounding wilderness."

The thinnest sheet of lead can block the most powerful of divination, and it is often used as a mean to protect against magical prying. A purer form of lead, called deep lead or sometimes dimeritium, exists. It is a silvery metal with a hint of blue found only rarely in mineral veins. Deep lead is highly toxic, and those frequently exposed to it regularly experience migraines, respiratory diseases or even seizures. These effects are amplified for magical creatures and spellcasters that will instantly feel nauseous in its presence and intense physical pain at its contact. Witch Hunters rely heavily on deep lead and have integrated in their arsenal several devices based on that metal to face their most dangerous enemy: spellcasters."

For this reason, most are constantly chained and never see the light of the day, locked down in some deep vault until there is no other solution left but to use them.
