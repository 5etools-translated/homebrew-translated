					"描述",
					"Aarakocra是一个聪明的鸟人种族，他们生活在最高的山峰上，在和平和孤独中度过他们的热风翱翔的日子。Aarakocra身高约为5英尺，翼展为20英尺。",
					"沿着每个翅膀的边缘大约一半是一只手，有三个人类大小的手指和一个对立的拇指。修长的第四个手指延伸到翅膀的长度，并锁在原地以便飞行。",
					"虽然翼手在飞行时不能抓握，但当arakocra在地面上，翅膀向后折叠时，它们几乎和人类的手一样有用。翅膀上的肌肉固定在一个骨质的胸板上，为arakocra提供额外的保护。",
					"强有力的腿的末端是四个锋利的爪子，可以解锁并折回，露出另一双功能性的手，也有三个人类大小的手指和一个对立的拇指。手骨与阿拉科拉的其他骨架一样，是空心的、脆弱的。",
					"Aarakocra的脸类似于鹦鹉和鹰的杂交体。它们有灰黑色的喙，黑色的眼睛正面镶嵌在头部，提供敏锐的双眼视觉。羽毛的颜色因部落而异，但通常雄性是红色、橙色和黄色，而雌性是棕色和灰色。",
					"Aarakocra会说他们自己的语言、巨鹰的语言，偶尔也会说普通话（10%的机会）。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Aarakocra生活在由大约1d20+10名成员组成的小部落里。每个部落都有一个大约10,000平方英里的狩猎领地，用五颜六色的横幅和旗帜标明边界。",
					"每个部落都住在一个用藤蔓编织的公共巢穴里，里面是柔软的干草衬垫。最年长的男性担任部落的领袖。在20人以上的部落中，第二年长的男性担任萨满，领导简单的宗教仪式，包括在新月份的第一天日落时分吹奏旋律优美的赞美诗。",
					"雄性花大部分清醒的时间猎取食物，偶尔也猎取宝物，如宝石和其他闪亮的物体。雌性每年花八个月的时间孵化它们的蛋，通过用木头和石头制作标枪和其他工具来打发时间。",
					"在仰卧休息时，雌性阿拉科克拉人可以同时使用四只手，用藤蔓和羽毛编织界旗、标枪鞘和其他有用的物品。",
					"包括萨满在内的五个阿拉科拉可以通过吟唱和表演复杂的空中舞蹈来召唤一个空气元素，持续三个近战回合。被召唤的空气元素会满足阿拉科拉人的请求，尽管它不会为他们的利益而危及自己的生命。",
					"Aarakocra有极强的幽闭恐惧症，不会愿意进入洞穴、建筑物或其他封闭区域。",
					"生态学",
					"Aarakocra很少与其他物种打交道，包括邻近的arakocra部落，只有在极端情况下才会离开他们的家乡。他们很少遇到人类，除了偶尔进入农村社区抢夺一只流浪的农场动物；这并不是故意的恶意行为，因为arakocra无法区分家畜和野生动物。",
					"进入阿拉科拉族领地的人类可能会说服阿拉科拉族担任向导或侦察员，以换取闪亮的珠宝或硬币。"

					"描述",
					"Aboleth是一种令人厌恶的两栖生物，生活在地下的洞穴和湖泊里。它鄙视大多数陆生生物，并试图奴役有智慧的地表生物。它既残酷又聪明。",
					"Aboleth类似于一条丰满的鱼，从它的球形头到它的绒毛状尾巴有20英尺长。它的身体是蓝绿色的，有灰色的斑点，粉红色的腹部隐藏着一张没有牙齿的橡胶嘴。三只狭长的眼睛，呈紫红色，有骨质脊柱保护，一前一后地镶嵌在它的头顶上。它的身体底部有四个脉动的蓝黑色孔洞，分泌灰色粘液，闻起来像馊掉的油脂。从它的头部长出四条皮状的触手，每条都有10英尺长。Aboleth用它的尾巴在水中推动自己，用它的触手在干地上拖动自己。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"一窝阿波利特由一只亲鸟和一到三只后代组成。虽然后代和亲代一样大，一样强壮，但它们在所有问题上都听从亲代的意见，并默默地服从它。Aboleth有男性和女性的性器官。成熟的Aboleth每五年繁殖一次，将自己隐藏在一个洞穴或其他偏远地区，然后产下一个蛋，用粘液覆盖。在胚胎生长和发育的过程中，亲代甲壳虫守护着卵，这个过程大约需要五年时间。一个新生的aboleth需要大约10年才能成熟。",
					"aboleth大部分时间都在寻找奴隶，最好是人类的奴隶。有传言说，boleth用他们的奴隶来建造巨大的水下城市，尽管还没有发现。有传言说，阿波利特知道比人类存在更早的古老、可怕的秘密，但这些传言也是未经证实的。毫无疑问，Aboleth保留了数量惊人的知识。一个后代在出生时就获得了其父母的所有知识，而一个成熟的aboleth会获得它所消费的任何智能生物的知识。",
					"阿波勒斯的宝藏包括从它的奴隶身上取得的物品。这些物品被埋藏在洞穴中，在一层类似于灰色泥浆的粘液下，可通过独特的酸败油脂气味识别。",
					"生态学",
					"杂食性的Aboleth会吃任何有机物，通常是藻类和微生物，但它们也喜欢智能猎物，这样它们可以同时吸收营养和信息。Aboleth没有天敌，因为即使是最强大的海洋生物也会给它们一个宽阔的空间。Aboleth粘液有时被用作水呼吸药剂的成分。"

					"在真正的Tanar'ri中，Alkiliths有一个不同寻常的目的：他们的存在是为了腐蚀他们所接触的一切，通过掠夺任何与之接触的东西来扩大深渊的范围。阿基里斯试图从身体和道德上污染深渊之外的世界。当格拉布瑞祖（glabrezu）和琥珀（succubi）等恶魔将凡人带到深渊时，白化石则致力于将深渊本身带到任何不幸的世界。炼金术士破坏美丽的事物，亵渎神圣的事物，并将恐惧或怨恨的余烬煽动成愤怒的仇恨。通过在整个多元宇宙中散布混乱和邪恶，他们会增加深渊的力量。",

					"描述",
					"ankheg是一种钻地怪物，通常在森林或选择农业用地中发现。由于它喜欢吃鲜肉，安克希格对任何不幸遇到它的生物都是一种威胁。安克希格类似于一个巨大的多腿蠕虫。它的六条腿的末端是锋利的钩子，适合钻洞和抓取，它强大的下颚能够一口将一棵小树咬成两半。",
					"除了柔软的粉红色腹部外，它的整个身体都覆盖着坚硬的甲壳，通常是棕色或黄色。安克希格有一双闪闪发光的黑眼睛，一张小嘴里有一排排细小的几丁质牙齿，还有两根敏感的触角，可以探测到300英尺以外的人类大小的生物的运动。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"安克希格用它的下颚在森林或农田的肥沃土壤中连续挖掘30-40英尺深的蜿蜒隧道。隧道中空的一端作为临时巢穴，用于睡觉、吃饭或冬眠。",
					"当蚂蚁在某一特定的森林或田野中耗尽食物供应时，它就会转移到另一个地方。秋天是安克希格的交配季节。雄性使雌性受精后，雌性将其杀死，并在其体内存放2d6个受精卵。在几个星期内，大约75%的卵孵化出来并开始进食。一年后，小蚂蚁与成年人相似，可以独立工作。",
					"年轻的安克希斯有2个命中率，整体的AC值为10，底部的AC值为12；他们咬人造成2d4点伤害（酶的分泌物会造成额外的ld4点伤害），并向30英尺外吐出1d6点伤害。",
					"在此后的每一年里，安克希格都会以完全的成人能力运作，并获得额外的命中率，直到它达到6个命中率。从生命的第二年开始，安克希格在冬季来临之前会脱去它的壳。它需要两天时间脱去旧壳，两周时间长出新壳。",
					"在这段时间内，呆滞的安克希格是非常脆弱的。此外，它的移动速度只有正常速度的一半，它的下颚攻击只造成1d6点伤害，而且它无法喷出酸性酶。",
					"在长出新壳的时候，它通过躲在一个很深的隧道里并分泌一种闻起来像腐烂水果的排斥性液体来保护自己。虽然这种香气使大多数生物望而却步，但它也能为人类猎人和饥肠辘辘的掠食者确定安克希格的位置。",
					"生活在寒冷气候中的安克希格在冬季会进行冬眠。在第一场雪后的一个月内，安克希格会在温暖的土地深处建造一个巢穴，在那里一直休眠到春天。冬眠的安克希格不需要食物，而是靠储存在其壳中的营养物质来维持生计。",
					"虽然安克希格的新陈代谢减少，但它的触角仍然有效，能够提醒它注意入侵者的到来。",
					"被打扰的安克希格会在1d4回合内完全苏醒，之后它可以正常攻击和移动。ankheg不会囤积财宝。没有被酸性酶溶解的物品会从安克希格的下颚掉落，可以在其隧道系统中找到散落的物品。",
					"生态学",
					"尽管饥饿的安克希格对农民来说是致命的，但它对农田却相当有益。它的隧道系统为土壤铺设了空气和水的通道，而安克希格的废物则增加了丰富的营养。",
					"ankheg会吃泥土中腐烂的有机物，但它更喜欢吃新鲜的肉。除了最凶猛的掠食者外，所有的掠食者都会避开安克希格。晒干和腌制的安克希格的壳可以制成盔甲，其AC值为16，其消化酶可以作为普通酸使用。",
					"安克希格被用作增强下列法术的材料成分：{@spell Mage Armor}"

					"除了正常的攻击之外，annis还有每天施放三次雾云的能力。这个咒语用来迷惑抵抗者或延迟优势敌人的攻击。Annis也可以像所有的女巫一样伪装自己，出现在高大的人类、食人魔，甚至是一个小巨人。为了确定法术范围、持续时间等，这些法术是在8级时施放的。",

					"女性亚马逊人的数量只有男性的一半。两性在生活中的大部分时间都是严格隔离的，因为如果允许它们混在一起，它们就会不可避免地相互争斗。雄性和雌性畜群只有在交配时才会混在一起，交配发生在与baatezu的成功战斗之后。年轻人与仆人和营地的追随者一起被驱赶，直到他们从死去的剧团成员那里夺得自己的武器并杀死一个敌人，这时他们就会加入成年人的行列。",
					"每个阿曼尼特剧团都有一个单独的剧团旗帜和他们当前主人或女主人的旗帜，例如格拉兹兹特的黑白斜线或帕兹拉尔的暗红色金爪。如果旗帜在战斗中丢失，该团就会解散，到无尽之门平原的某个领主家里去服役，或者试图加入另一个团。旗帜是每个战团的象征和统一原则；没有旗帜，阿曼人就会互相争斗，很快就会分崩离析。",
					"由于他们作为独立的团体运作良好，亚门人经常被选中为深渊领主执行特殊任务。他们在上层世界被称为 \"黑暗骑士 \"或 \"黑暗骑手\"，在那里受到人们的敬畏。他们在Sigil也很常见，有时他们在那里充当嗜血的保镖。",

					"相对于正式的决斗或武器表演，阿曼人更喜欢喧闹的、混乱的团体战斗。他们经常像战犬一样在塔纳里的大厅和城楼上争吵，挑起一场与一个阿曼尼特人的战斗意味着与整个团队的恩怨。阿曼尼特人鄙视巴里亚尔人，一见到他们就会攻击他们。"

					"描述",
					"女妖或呻吟的灵魂，是一个邪恶的女精灵的灵魂，确实非常罕见。女妖憎恨活人，认为他们的存在是痛苦的，并试图伤害他们遇到的任何人。",
					"女妖会以漂浮的、发光的幻影出现在人们面前。她们的形象在夜间会发出亮光，但在阳光下是透明的（在隐身检查中具有优势）。大多数女妖都是老态龙钟，但也有少数早逝的女妖保留了她们以前的美丽。呻吟的灵魂的头发是野生的，不加修饰。她的衣服通常是破烂不堪的破布。她的脸是痛苦的面具，但仇恨和愤怒在她的眼睛里燃烧得很旺。女妖经常痛苦地喊叫，因此被称为女妖。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"女妖厌恶所有生物，因此在荒凉的乡村或古老的废墟中安家。白天它们躲在那里，当它们不能热衷于此时，晚上就在周围的乡村游荡。围绕着呻吟之灵的巢穴的土地上散布着听到呻吟之灵呼喊的野兽的骨头。一旦一个呻吟的灵魂建立了她的巢穴，她就会留在那里。",
					"呻吟的灵魂的宝藏差别很大，往往反映了他们在生活中的所爱。许多人囤积了黄金和精美的宝石。其他呻吟的灵魂，特别是那些在他们以前的家里出没的，表现出更高的品味，保存着伟大的艺术品和雕塑，或强大的魔法物品。",
					"几乎不可能将一个呻吟的灵魂的哭声与人类或精灵女人的痛苦区分开来。许多英勇的骑士把这两种声音搞错了，然后为这个错误付出了生命的代价。女妖非常聪明，会说许多语言，包括普通话、精灵语和其他半人类语言。",
					"女妖偶尔会利用她们的破坏力来寻求对她们生前对手的报复。",
					"生态学",
					"女妖无论在哪里定居都是一种祸害。他们杀人不眨眼，他们唯一的乐趣就是别人的不幸和痛苦。除了杀戮人类和野兽，呻吟的灵魂对植被也有强大的影响。鲜花和娇嫩的植物会枯萎和死亡，树木会变得扭曲和病态，而较强壮的植物，如荆棘等，则会蓬勃发展。几年后，在呻吟鬼的巢穴五英里范围内，只剩下一片荒凉的旷野，到处是扭曲的树木和荆棘，还有那些敢于进入呻吟鬼领域的生物的骨头。"

					"Barghest还能随意变成一只大型战犬或野狗的形态。因此，这种生物经常被称为 \"魔鬼狗\"，但这是一个错误的说法。所采取的确切形式可能因生物而异，但所有的形式都是典型的野狗或战狗的形式，几乎不可能（95%的可能性）将其与自然界的同类区分开。然而，自然界的狗会立即认出、害怕和憎恨barghest，它们会在任何机会攻击它。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"这些生物原产于Gehenna，并倾向于在该平面上孤立地生活。在那里，每个barghest都有自己的据点和仆从部队，对其进行专制统治。地精很容易认出并崇拜巴格斯塔（即使是地精的形态），但其他种族发现它们与这些普通的原始物质怪物几乎没有什么区别。妖精的主人惧怕并服务于驳壳怪，经常不遗余力地给它们带来合适的礼物和祭品，而驳壳怪则通过杀死妖精的强大敌人以及普遍丰富妖精的宝藏来回应。",
					"偶尔，Gehenna上的barghest会产下一窝六只幼崽，它们会被立即送到主物质界去喂养和成长。那些活下来的孩子最终会回到Gehenna，但在他们离开时，他们必须以人类和半人类为食。巴格斯特的幼崽可以单独或成对出现在主物质界，通常生活在人类的孤立社区附近，或与地精的队伍在一起。",
					"当巴格斯特的幼崽第一次来到主物质世界时，他们相对较弱，只有6个命中值。然而，它们每杀死或吞噬一个能量（经验）级别的人类（或半人类）生命，就会在它们的总数上增加1个命中点。一旦他们吸收了8个等级，他们就会获得另一个命中率。请注意，0级的角色对barghest来说只值二分之一的经验值，所以他们是比高级英雄更不具吸引力的目标。此外，每当barghest获得一个命中率，它的护甲等级和力量值就会增加1。当barghest最终达到完全的成长和力量时，它发现了飞机转移到Gehenna的能力，在那里它寻找自己的恶臭的山谷裂缝来统治。",
					"驳壳船在地府的据点里收集了多少财宝不得而知，尽管有传言说这是一笔巨大的财富。然而，当他们生活在主物质界时，他们没有积累任何个人财宝。",

					"人居环境/社会",
					"Berbalang是一种最不寻常的生物。它生命中的绝大部分时间都是在类似死亡的恍惚中度过的，这使得怪物的精神可以在整个星界随意游荡。在这里，Berbalang会跟踪那些比自己弱小的生物，并进行复杂的求爱和交配仪式。",
					"如果身体被发现或受到任何干扰，Berbalang会意识到这一点并返回来保护自己。由于Berbalang的精神必须穿越很长的距离才能到达它的物质形态，这可能需要相当长的时间（1d100回合）。如果身体在Berbalang能够自卫之前被摧毁，那么星体的精神也会被杀死。出于这个原因，贝巴朗会尽力隐蔽和保护其物质形态的休息场所。",
					"每月一次，在满月的三天里，贝巴朗会回到主物质界觅食。在这个时候，该生物会稍微改变它的精神状态，并表现出一个与自己完全相同的副本，即所谓的投影。一旦投影形成，它就会被派去寻找Berbalang的唯一食物--刚被杀死的人类。",
					"由贝巴朗直接控制的投影，可以从它的身体出发，最远可达三英里。如果投射物必须战斗，它就会像伯巴郎本身一样进行战斗（见上文）。",
					"如果投射物在寻找食物的过程中被击中或受到任何伤害，它就会立即飞走并逃走。Berbalang尽可能快地引导它的投射物回到它休息的地方。如果投射物被摧毁，有75%的机会证明对Berbalang系统的冲击对它也是致命的。如果投射物只是受伤，但没有被杀死，那么Berbalang在相当于它所损失的命中率的天数内不能再显现出另一个投射物。",
					"当投影回到它的主人身边时，它就会消散。跟随投射物去解决它的冒险者可能会震惊地发现自己面对的是一个健康的Berbalang。",
					"如果贝巴朗没有被发现和摧毁，它最终会向那些干扰它进食的人报仇。虽然可能会有一段平静的时间，当贝巴朗的身体从对其投影的攻击中恢复过来，并能够发出另一个投影时，报应是肯定的。",
					"如果投射物被逼回体内或在找到猎物进食前被摧毁，贝巴朗会在有能力时立即派出另一个投射物，以满足其饥饿感（无论月相如何），然后再寻求报复。",
					"生态学",
					"当投影杀死一个人时，它拿起尸体并开始带着它回到它的巢穴。当它这样做的时候，Berbalang本身从恍惚中苏醒过来，投影开始以尸体为食。当投影到达Berbalang的藏身之处时，尸体已经被剥去了所有的肉，Berbalang的饥饿感已经得到满足。",
					"为了避免引起人们的注意，Berbalang通常每隔三或四个月就会转移巢穴。在这个时候，它只在夜间移动，并尽可能避免任何对抗。因此，与Berbalang本身的实际接触，相对于它的投影，是最小的。",
					"没有记录显示有人发现，当Berbalang只以它猎杀的人类为食时，它是如何获得养分的。同样，当Berbalang与其他物种的唯一接触是以精神形式在星界进行时，它能够进行交配和繁殖的确切过程仍然是一个谜。"

					"拉什玛尔传说中的bheur，即蓝女巫，据说是冬天的使者，能够在广大地区传播致命的寒冷。Rashemaar的故事不确定是否只有一个bheur或许多bheur，但在所有的故事中，她都是一个强大而恶毒的生物，她的作用是帮助带来冬天。每年春天，她都会被打败并被赶走。",
					"在大多数故事中，Bheur类似于一个Hidepus，满脸皱纹的老妪，有着苍白的蓝白色皮肤和雪白的头发，裹着一条破旧的灰蓝色披肩。她拿着一根比她本人还高的灰色拐杖，她的声音发出冰冷的风的嚎叫。",
					"有些故事说，蓝巫婆和orglash（冰灵）协同工作，误导、攻击和吞噬旅行者。没有人知道这些关于蓝女巫和orglash合作的故事是否真实；证人不可能活着讲述这个故事。",
					"还有一些传说提到了高级巫师（Rashemen的女巫）和你的bheur之间的史诗般的战斗，以及由于女巫的胜利而导致的春天提前到来的情况。女巫们自己认为，bheur是土地的一个自然部分，并有一个有用的目的，但如果蓝巫婆开始任意或残忍地行事，她们将与之斗争。正如女巫们所说，冬天是一年中最美好的时光，但即使是冬天，在锤子月里也显得苍白无力。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"有些人声称是布赫自己带来了寒冷，有些人则认为是寒冷引来了布赫。",
					"当天空变成板灰色，大雪在呼啸的狂风中从天而降时，拉西玛尔人紧闭大门，确定他们已经为冬天准备了足够的木材和食物，并在可怕的天气中瑟缩。在这段时间里，Bheur在国外，大多数Rashemaar人非常害怕她。就像可怕的乌特拉基变身精灵一样，赫伊尔更喜欢捕食孤独的旅行者，把他们冻住，吞噬他们冰冷的身体。据说，如果门窗没有封好，赫伊尔也会潜入人们的家中，抢走年幼的孩子或毫无戒心的居民。这样的故事可能是提醒人们不要把窗户和门打开，但它们通常能使年轻的拉舍马尔人因害怕蓝巫婆而保持一致。",
					"生态学",
					"没有人见过两个蓝衣女巫在一起，因此人们普遍认为，整个拉舍曼只有一个bheur。在冰冻受害者后，Bheur会以冰冷的尸体为食，据说任何看到Bheur吞噬受害者的人都可能会被打瞎或被逼疯。目睹这种行为的人物必须成功地对死亡魔法进行拯救，否则就会失明（75%）或被逼疯（25%）。疯了的角色会逃跑（50%），攻击附近的任何人，不管是朋友还是敌人（30%），或者瘫倒在紧张的一堆中，无法说话和行动（20%）。疯癫持续2d6天，除非受害者收到{@spell cure disease}或{@spell remove curse}的法术。"

					"波达克在外观上只是模糊的人形，但有时会保留一些他们曾经是凡人的小特征。这可能表现为紧张的抽搐，奇特的战斗风格，或其他任何波达克在其正常生活中可能拥有的东西。",

					"黄铜龙是非常社会化的。它们通常与邻近的黄铜龙和狮身人面兽关系良好。黄铜龙是敬业的父母。如果它们的幼崽受到攻击，它们会设法杀死敌人，使用它们的热呼吸武器，并充分利用它们自身的免疫力。",
					"因为它们有相同的栖息地，蓝龙是黄铜龙最可怕的敌人。黄铜龙通常在一对一的对抗中得到最坏的结果，主要是因为蓝龙的呼吸武器伸得更远。正因为如此，黄铜龙通常试图躲避蓝龙，直到它们能够召集邻居进行大规模攻击。",

					"虫熊的鼻子很像熊的鼻子，具有同样精细的嗅觉。正是这一特征为他们赢得了自己的名字，尽管他们实际上与熊没有任何关系。他们坚韧的皮革皮和长而锋利的指甲也像熊一样，但要比熊灵巧得多。",
					"典型的虫熊的视觉和听觉都很出色，在需要的时候，它们能以惊人的敏捷性移动。虫熊的视力在一定程度上延伸到了红外线，使它们的暗视距离达到60英尺。",

					"Bulette（发音为Boo-lay）被恰当地称为陆鲨，是一种可怕的掠食者，只为吃而活着。布莱特被普遍避开，甚至被其他怪物避开。",
					"据传闻，布莱特是犰狳和鳄龟的杂交体，但这只是猜测。",
					"布雷特的头部和后部是蓝褐色的，它们覆盖着从灰蓝色到蓝绿色的板和鳞片。指甲和牙齿是暗淡的象牙色。眼睛周围的区域是棕黑色的，眼睛是淡黄色的，瞳孔是蓝绿色的。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"幸运的是，山雀是一种独居动物，尽管交配的一对（非常罕见）会分享同一个领地。此外，其他捕食者很少与陆鲨分享一个领地，因为它们害怕被吃掉。土拨鼠没有巢穴，喜欢在其领地内徘徊，无论是地上还是地下，都会钻到土壤下面去休息。由于它们的胃口如此之大，每只陆鲨都有一个大的领地，范围可以达到30平方英里。",
					"虫子会吃掉它们的受害者，包括衣服、武器和所有东西，而且胃里的强酸会迅速消化受害者的盔甲、武器和魔法物品。它们也不忘啃食箱子或口袋里的硬币，布列特的座右铭是先吃后想。当领地内的所有东西都被吃掉后，布莱特会继续前进，寻找一个新的领地。一个合适的领地的唯一标准是是否有食物，所以布莱特偶尔会在人类和半身人的领地附近划出一块新的领地，恐吓居民。",
					"对布莱特的生命周期知之甚少。它们可能是从蛋中孵化出来的，但从来没有发现过小鱼，尽管6个命中率的小陆鲨被杀死过。可能布莱特是从非常小的蛋中孵化出来的，很少有幼鱼能活到成熟期。还有一些圣人推测，布莱特会生下活的幼崽。也有证据表明，像鲤鱼和鲨鱼一样，布列特鱼随着年龄的增长而变大，因为人们已经看到了11英尺高或更高的异常大的陆鲨。当然，从来没有人遇到过因年老而死亡的布列特熊的尸体。",
					"生态学",
					"布莱特对它所居住的任何地区的生态系统都有破坏性的影响。从字面上看，任何移动的东西都不会受到它的影响，无论是人、动物，还是怪物。在狩猎和漫游的过程中，陆鲨会将相当大的树木连根拔起。在丘陵和岩石地区，布莱特的地下运动可以引发小型山体滑坡。食人魔、巨魔，甚至一些巨人，在布莱特出现时都会离开，去寻找更绿、更安全的牧场。",
					"一个布莱特可以在短短几周内把一个和平的农业社区变成一片荒地，因为没有一个正常的人类或半人类会留在发现布莱特的地区。",
					"布莱特的存在只有一个已知的好处。它头部后面的大板块是极好的盾牌，矮人铁匠可以把它们做成价值+1至+3的盾牌。有些人还声称，布莱特经过的土壤会被赋予神奇的岩石溶解特性。然而，许多人认为，这些好处几乎不值得花钱。",

					"布勒索酷似牛头人，但它面容憔悴，骨骼分明，肉体污秽，疾病缠身。这种生物没有皮毛，而是在破损的、布满疖子的皮肤上长着几块毛茸茸的鬃毛。它的脚是有爪的，而不是有蹄的，它有一条长长的蛇形尾巴，尾部有一丛铁质的硬刺。Bulezau的角和头更像公羊，而不是像公牛，它的嘴里长着针状的小獠牙。Bulezau的武器通常是巨大的三叉戟、杆臂或邪恶设计的晨星。",
					"Bulezau可以艰难地说出各星球的通用贸易术语，或者随意地用一种弱的心灵感应形式进行交流。对于一个切割者来说，不管它的语言有多像动物，都要表现出他完全理解bulezau的样子，这是一个好主意，因为它不是一个有耐心的bossher。如果bulezau决定从一个草皮上撕下手臂比和他说话更容易，它不会等很久才采取行动的冲动。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Bulezau是一种争吵不休、恃强凌弱的生物，经常陷入彼此间的致命分歧。只有强大的大人物或真正的塔纳瑞人的权威才能使他们不互相残杀，即便如此，也只有在战斗的承诺临近时才会如此。Bulezau为战斗而活，认为所有其他活动都是浪费时间。他们是糟糕的纠察队、哨兵或侦察兵，因为他们没有耐心等待或尝试隐身，如果Bulezau看到敌人，它就会冲锋，如果它没有看到敌人，它就会去寻找。",
					"Bulezau可能是难以控制的部队，但他们非常擅长他们的工作。一旦投入战斗，他们没有任何保留，不顾一切地投入战斗。对于塔纳瑞人的指挥官来说，布勒索人是一伙贪婪的疯子，他们会尝试任何攻击，并且从不退缩，无论胜算有多大。这种忠诚在深渊中很难找到，即使它是无法控制的嗜血而不是铁的纪律。",
					"塔纳瑞人的指挥官早就认识到，把布勒索留在战争前线附近是个好主意。他们只是太过愚蠢和具有攻击性，无法长期保持在非战斗状态下。",
					"有一个强大而有魅力的指挥官，bulezau可以勉强控制住自己。深渊的高层有时会建立一支无情而狂热的bulezau卫队，认为有这样有能力和忠诚（对tanar'ri来说）的战士在背后支持和召唤是值得头痛的。",
					"生态学",
					"有传言说，塔纳瑞人的领主巴弗灭，即牛头人的守护神，是创造布勒索的罪魁祸首。谣传说巴弗灭与他的牛头人仆人和一些为他服务的tanar'ri交配，但没有办法知道这是否是一种皮毛。还有人说，巴弗灭保持着一支由凶猛的bulezau组成的保镖，他们具有不同寻常的忠诚度和纪律性。",
					"Bulezau通常受到地位较高的塔纳瑞人的重视，因为Bulezau以极大的热情追求血战，以至于当他们在附近时，一个更微妙的塔纳瑞人就会失去踪影。塔纳瑞人的指挥官高度重视布勒索人的编队，并在可能的情况下不遗余力地召集这些部队。另一方面，实力较弱的塔纳瑞人很少愿意靠近布勒索，因为这种生物很可能在受到最小的挑衅时就飞走，变成杀人狂魔，不计后果。在一些交战中，由于bulezau的急躁而失去的dretches和rutterkin比baatezu的行动更多。",
					"Bulezau与vrocks有激烈的竞争，两者之间的相遇几乎总是爆发战斗，除非附近有baatezu可以对付。"

					"描述",
					"恶霸蛙是一种双足的、类似青蛙的两栖动物。他们居住在沼泽地、沼泽、沼泽或其他潮湿的地方。",
					"霸王龙浑身覆盖着光滑、斑驳的橄榄绿皮，相当坚韧。它们的大小不一，从比普通人小到约7英尺高。他们的脸类似于巨大的青蛙，有宽大的嘴巴和大而圆的眼睛；他们的脚和手都有蹼。虽然他们不穿衣服，但如果有武器、盔甲和盾牌，所有恶霸都会使用。恶霸蛙有自己的语言，更聪明的恶霸蛙能说有限的普通话。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"比青蛙更聪明，所有的恶霸武者都生活在有组织或半组织的社会法西斯团体中，为了狩猎和生存而合作。他们主要以鱼和其他任何游戏为生，更喜欢吃肉。它们是熟练的猎人和渔夫，并能熟练使用和建造网兜和渔网。",
					"霸王虫社会是一个野蛮的社会。雄性是主导的性别，雌性的存在只是为了产卵。尽管雌性和幼崽在任何一个部落中都占了一半，但它们在社会秩序中的作用却很小。恃强凌弱者唯一的尊重标志是对他们的领袖和他们奇怪的青蛙之神。这个种族完全缺乏任何高级的情感或感觉。",
					"恶霸虫社区的首领是一个拥有18点命中率的大型个体。30只或更多的恶霸虫社区有五个副首领（每个16点）和一个强大的首领（3个HD，27点，强度14）。60只或更多的恶霸虫社区有一个首领（4HD，36HP，强度14）和五个副首领（3HD，27HP，强度14）。",
					"所有小霸王都喜欢住在阴暗潮湿的地方，因为它们必须保持皮肤湿润。大多数霸王龙生活在开放的地方，只保持松散的领地边界。普通的恶霸犬不会非常有效地处理入侵它们领地的行为，但如果可以的话，它们会杀死和吃掉入侵者。他们对自己的大型亲戚高级恶霸蛙恨之入骨，一有机会就向它们开战。霸王龙珍视财宝，尽管这对它们来说好处不大。他们重视硬币和珠宝，偶尔也会在他们的囤积物中发现一件神奇的物品。",
					"在个人层面上，恶霸武者缺乏在其他混沌种族（如兽人）的个人身上看到的贪婪和权力欲望。例如，同一群体的成员之间的战斗几乎不存在。有人会说，这是因为他们缺乏挑起战斗的智慧，而不是因为缺乏怨恨。部落由占主导地位的男性领导，当它太老而无法统治时，它就会杀死并吃掉以前的领导者。这是他们之间为数不多的争斗情况之一。",
					"生态学",
					"霸王龙倾向于破坏生态系统，而不是填补其中的一个利基。它们没有合理收获食物供应的智慧，它们会在一个地区捕鱼和狩猎，直到自然资源耗尽，然后转移到一个新的领土。他们憎恨人类，一见到他们就会攻击他们，但幸运的是，他们更喜欢居住在远离人类的孤立地区。",

					"腐尸爬虫有时会与配偶生活在一起，或在一个人数不超过6人的小群体中生活。这并不意味着它们合作捕猎，而只是分享同一空间，并为同一食物进行激烈的竞争。如果两只爬虫杀了人或发现了腐肉，它们往往会争夺食物，有时会在这个过程中互相残杀。",
					"腐尸爬虫每年交配一次。交配后几天，雌性会去寻找一个大的猎物。当她找到或杀死足够的食物供应时，她在腐肉中产下大约100个卵。蛴螬一周后孵化，开始进食。",

					"卡托布莱帕斯的身体就像一头大而臃肿的水牛，它的腿很粗，就像侏儒象或河马的腿。它那长长的蛇形尾巴迅速而有力，可以以惊人的速度移动。鲶鱼的头栖息在一个长而弱的脖子上，很像疣猪的头，只是鲶鱼更丑。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"在大多数情况下，catoblepas是一种蜿蜒的生物，在沼泽地里游荡，啃食沼泽草之类的东西。每月一次，通常是在满月的光照下，catoblepas会寻找肉类来充实自己的食物。在这个时候，冒险者最有可能遇到catoblepas。",
					"卡托布莱帕斯的巢穴通常是某种遮蔽的地方，地面很坚实。更多的时候，它被高大的芦苇或其他沼泽植物所包围。这种生物在巢穴中几乎不害怕被打扰，因为它经常是沼泽中最令人恐惧的食肉动物。",
					"Catoblepas终身交配，当遇到一个以上的Catoblepas时，它们将是一对交配的伴侣。有10%的机会，这对夫妇会有一个单一的后代。一个未成年的catoblepas会有成人一半的命中率。子代需要将近9年的时间才能达到青春期的成熟，成年雌性每10或12年才会生一个孩子。雌雄双方都会合作抚养后代。",
					"当catoblepas冒险去狩猎时，它吃鱼、沼泽鸟、鳗鱼、水老鼠、大型两栖动物、蛇和其他沼泽动物。鲶鱼通常用它的尾巴击晕猎物，然后用它的目光杀死它。",
					"在狩猎时，catoblepas是一个机会主义的捕食者，它不喜欢吃腐肉。由于它是半智能的，它将尊重人类的聚会，宁可先打量他们。通常情况下，它不会攻击，除非它正在捕猎或感到它的配偶或后代受到威胁。作为长寿动物（150至200年左右）和半智能动物，catoblepas能够从先前的遭遇和狩猎的错误中学习。",

					"洞穴鱼人是一种大型昆虫类动物，已经适应了地下生活。它结合了蜘蛛和龙虾的许多特征。洞穴鱼人有一个由重叠的板块组成的坚硬的壳和八条腿。6条后腿用于移动和在石质步行道和走廊上的牵引。",
					"由于这些肢体的存在，鱼鹰在垂直墙面上的上下移动并不困难。前面的一对腿配备了强有力的钳子，用于杀死和肢解猎物。洞穴鱼人最不寻常的特征是它的长鼻子，它可以发射一种强而有力的粘性丝。这种怪物还可以用它的粘合剂将自己固定在墙壁和壁架上。",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"洞穴鱼人喜欢生活在位于交通便利的道路上方的壁架和洞穴中，与其他同类分享他们的巢穴。在一个巢穴中不会发现超过四个洞穴鱼人。它们的丝线总是在巢穴前串起，并试图杀死任何它们捕获的东西，经常储存食物供将来使用。",
					"它们的领地非常小，永远不会超过巢穴两侧约300英尺的范围。任何人类大小的东西都被洞穴鱼人视为公平的游戏，半身人被认为是美味的食物。",
					"一只洞穴鱼人绝不会为了吃一顿饭而攻击一支装备精良的大型队伍。不过，它们还是很狡猾的，如果一群怪物认为可以逃脱的话，它们可能会卷起丝线并试图进行伏击。如果一个地区的猎物变得稀少，洞穴鱼人就会简单地找到一个新的地区进行捕猎，那里的小猎物更多，也更粗心。像所有的捕食者一样，洞穴捕鱼者对生存感兴趣。这意味着要有稳定的食物供应和配偶。",
					"雌性在巢穴附近产卵，它们保护巢穴不受捕食者侵害。卵孵化后，小鱼就会四散开来，寻找自己的巢穴。虽然洞穴鱼人不收集财宝，但它的巢穴里经常散落着以前受害者的财物。",
					"生态学",
					"洞穴鱼人主要捕食小型飞行物，在地下世界，这经常意味着以蝙蝠为食。它不是其生态位中的顶级捕食者，并且在处理其他怪物时学会了谨慎。",
					"洞穴鱼人有足够的智慧，知道捕食组织良好的大型群体的危险性，这些群体可能会对它的掠夺行为感到厌倦，并将它猎杀至灭绝。这种怪物本能地选择最容易生存的路线，并依靠隐蔽和狡猾来诱捕其猎物，避免自己被吃掉。",
					"洞穴捕鱼者的丝线被许多盗贼行会高度珍视，因为它们可以被制成几乎看不见的、非常结实的细绳。这些细丝被缠绕在卷轴上，然后经过特殊处理，以稀释粘合剂。",
					"由此产生的股线被制成绳索，而稀释后的粘合剂则变成一种特殊的溶液，涂在手套上，就能起到保护作用。",

					"巢穴位于森林深处，由一大片隐蔽的草丛和牧场组成，有充足的自来水供应。根据气候的不同，巢穴中可能包含有小木屋或简易帐篷，以庇护各个家庭。半人马擅长园艺，并在其巢穴附近种植有用的植物。在危险的、怪物出没的地区，半人马有时会在巢穴周围种上厚厚的坚韧的荆棘丛，甚至设置陷阱和圈套。在远离树木的空旷地带，有用于烹饪和取暖的炉灶。",
					"如果在它们的巢穴中遇到，会有1d6只额外的雄性，相当于雄性数量两倍的雌性，以及5d6只幼崽。雌性（3个命中率）和幼崽（1d3个命中率）只用蹄子战斗，而且只在生死关头战斗。",
					"每个部落都会有一个被视为领袖的牧师，但拥有3级德鲁伊的法术能力。半人马通过狩猎、觅食、捕鱼、农业和贸易的混合方式生存。虽然他们回避与人类打交道，但半人马已经知道与精灵交易，特别是食物和酒。精灵们的报酬来自于团体的财库，而财库则来自于被杀死的怪物的战利品。",
					"The territory of a centaur tribe varies with its size and the nature of the area it inhabits. Centaurs are also not above sharing a territory with elves. The attitude of a centaur toward a stranger in its territory will vary with the visitor. Humans and dwarves will usually be asked to leave in a polite manner, while halflings or gnomes will be tolerated, and elves will be welcomed.",
					"Monsters will be dealt with in a manner according to the threat they represent to the welfare and survival of the tribe. Were a giant or dragon to enter the territory, the centaurs would pull up stakes and relocate, while trolls and orcs and their like will be killed.",
					"Centaurs will take the treasure of their fallen foes, and are fully aware of its value. Most male centaurs have a small coin supply, while the tribe has a treasury which may well include some magical items.",
					"Leaders will have twice the normal individual treasure. This treasure is used to buy food for the group, or to ransom captured or threatened members of the tribe.",
					"While basically neutral or chaotic good, centaurs have been known to become rowdy, boorish, and aggressive when under the influence of alcohol. They are also extremely protective of their females and young. Centaurs are basically pastoral, but will react with violence if their lifestyle and survival is threatened.",
					"生态学",
					"The centaur lives in close harmony with nature and spends its lifetime carefully conserving the natural resources around its lair. The race seems to have an innate knowledge of how to achieve this precious balance. If forced to chop down a tree, a centaur will plant another to replace it. Centaurs never over hunt or over fish an area as a human group might do, but choose their game with care, limiting the amount they eat."

A soul knows when he's being stalked by one of these monstrosities if he hears tinkling chains and an accompanying malicious titter.",
					"Kytons are humanoid, though it's hard to tell if they're human. They wear chains in lieu of clothing and armor, using this \"apparel\" as weapons. The body, arms, and legs are all tightly wrapped with smaller chains. When a kyton raises its arms, a cutter can see dangling ropes of metal chains studded with barbs, welded scraps of iron, and other small sharp implements.",
					"The kyton's head is also wrapped with chains, covering where the hair, eyes, ears, and nose would be on a normal humanoid. The only visible features on a kyton are its throat, its grimacing mouth, and occasionally one gleaming eye. Some people might wish they hadn't seen even that much. See, the kyton has a nasty habit of assuming the feature of a departed loved one or friend or sometimes that of much-feared enemy. Though all a berk can see is the lower part of the face, he can often reconstruct the rest of it. No one's really sure whether this is an illusion the creatures create, or if it's actually the dead person come to horrible \"life\" in the city of chains.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"All Kytons are equal in Jangling Hiter. They don't disagree over standing, though they do squabble over choice scraps of unlucky berks. These fights are short-lived and usually end with the victor claiming the morsel. The loser fades (flees, really) into the metal jungle of the city.",
					"The only treasure a kyton has is that of its victims. That hoard can valy widely, depending on the kyton's power and the resources of its quarry.",
					"生态学",
					"Kytons are the police force of the city, enforcing its edicts and trampling those who don't live by them. It's rumored that they eat their victims, though it's been put forth that what the kytons really consume are the spirits of those they hunt. These sages speculate that kytons survive on the anguish of the screaming spirits they catch.",
					"This is conjecture, for kytons have never been studied in depth. Bloods know a captured kyton can kill itself simply by willing it. And a dead kyton dissolves, leaving behind an acrid stench and a greasy puddle of chains and ichor nothing much there to study."

					"The monster has three heads, those of a goat, a lion, and a fierce dragon. The goat head is pitch black, with glowing amber eyes and long ochre horns. The lion head is framed by a brown mane and has green eyes. The dragon head is covered with orange scales and has black eyes.",
					"The chimera speaks a limited form of the foul language of red dragons. As a rule, however, it will only pause to communicate with those creatures who are more powerful than itself.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The chimera, being a hybrid, combines the preferences of the lion, the goat, and the dragon in its habitat, society and ecology. The dragonish part of its nature gives the chimera a distinct preference for caves as lairs. The dragon and lion parts seem to war with one another, for some chimerae are dragon-like in their preference for solitude, while others live in small prides. Even if they mate, offspring are rare.",
					"The monster is an omnivore. The goat head will browse on the toughest plants and shrubs and will derive nutrition from the most barren vegetation while the lion and dragon heads can only be satisfied with flesh. The chimera hunts once every 3 or 4 days, using its strength and limited intelligence to gain an advantage over those it preys on. Having a voracious appetite, it sometimes roams over territories as large as 20 square miles.",
					"Being chaotic evil in nature, the chimera enjoys preying upon men, elves, dwarves, and halflings. It will even gladly attack other monsters in its search for food. Anyone entering its territory becomes prey, and will be treated accordingly.",
					"The chimera cannot resist attacking groups of travelers or monsters for another reason: its dragon nature craves the treasure that its prey might be carrying. Although it has no earthly use for it, the chimera will gather the coins of its fallen foe into a heap and roost on it like a dragon. Its hoard is nothing like that of a true dragon, however, and consists mainly of copper and silver coins, with perhaps some jewelry and a few magical items.",
					"生态学",
					"The chimera fills the role of both omnivore and a top predator in its ecosystem. It is very adaptable. During times when its prey is scarce or non-existent, the chimera can make do with a vegetarian diet.",
					"The Gorgimera",
					"The gorgimera has the hindquarters of a gorgon, forequarters of a lion, and body and wings of a red dragon. Like the chimera, it has the heads of its three constituent creatures.",
					"The monster can attack with its claws, bite with its lion and dragon heads, and butt with its gorgon head. In place of making its normal attack, the gorgon and dragon heads can employ their breath weapons. While the dragon's attack is similar to that of the chimera, the gorgon's breath causes petrification to any caught in its area of effect. The gorgon head can use its breath weapon twice per day to strike in a cone 3 feet long which is 1 foot wide at its base and 3 feet wide at its mouth. The gorgimera will always use one of its breath weapons if its foes are within 10 feet. A save vs. petrification will allow a victim to avoid the effects of the gorgon's breath.",
					"The gorgon's head can see into both the Astral and Ethereal planes, and its breath weapon extends therein.",
					"Like its relative the chimera, the gorgimera can also speak a limited form of the language of red dragons.",
					"Chimera is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Heroism}"

This diminutive race of humanoids is most notable for its four arms which are jointed to allow for extra movement in ways that human limbs could never move. Their faces are human-looking, although they have multi-faceted eyes and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Long stringy black hair falls in a tangle from their skulls and grows down their backs, like the mane of a horse.",

					"Chitines wear clothing made from dried and processed silk. Bits of colored rocks, carved bones, and such are frequently woven throughout. They always keep their hands and feet uncovered. They carry their tools in pouches woven into their clothing. Chitines speak the language of the drow, and sometimes know a bit of other subterranean languages.",

The hardened webbing dwellings resemble domed houses, complete with windows and decorative shapes adorning them. These homes can be located on any surface, including the ceiling. Bridges of webbing cross the town, providing easy pathways. Suspended in the center of the cavern is usually a heartshaped temple devoted to the evil goddess Lolth.",
					"Chitines are cast-off experiments of the drow. They have increased in numbers over the centuries, and even now plot to overthrow the drow who are Lolth.s favorites. They are devoted to their spider queen and will do anything in her name. The priestesses of the chitines are rumored to be of a different and more powerful race, more akin to Lolth herself.",

Chitines eat anything that moves, sucking the fluids from the victim and leaving the dried remains on the cavern floor underneath their temple. Chitines are hunted by both drow and driders."

					"描述",
					"The choker is a vicious little monster found in caves and caverns. It has mottled gray or stony brown flesh, and looks more or less humanoid-with two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. The torso and head are as small and compact as a human baby's, but the arms and legs (and fingers!) are incredibly spindly and long. Stretched to its full length, an adult choker would stand nearly 6 feet tall.",
					"This creature's limbs are like tentacles, having cartilage but no actual bones, with numerous knobby joints. The cartilage in its fingers juts out through the skin, and is stiff and razor-sharp. Because it lacks bones for support, the choker appears bowlegged and lopes with a strange, fluid gait. The creature is not completely boneless, however; it does have a bony skull, spine, and rib cage.",
					"Chokers are vaguely intelligent and speak a primitive language.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Chokers are so primitive that they do not make or use tools. They can carve through solid rock with their fingers, and their lack of bones allows them to squeeze through openings impossible even for creatures of goblin size.",
					"Because chokers are inherently shy, they would have difficulty locating mates were it not for their special call. To attract a partner, both males and females keen. This whine (which humans and others find extremely irritating) echoes through the deep caverns the chokers call home. When a choker hears the keen of a potential mate, it answers. Then each creature keens in turn to draw the other near, until at last they meet. A few months later, the female gives birth to two to six young. The family stays together for three years, until the offspring have fully matured. Once the offspring have moved on, the parents separate and seek new mates.",
					"生态学",
					"The choker has a high metabolism. It burns an enormous number of calories, especially for a creature of its light weight. Consequently it is always on the lookout for victims on which to feed, and it consumes them rapidly. (A goblin provides about two days' food, for example.)",
					"Goblins are, in fact, the choker's favorite food. Chokers devour other races, such as dwarves or humans, but prefer the meat of goblins above all else.",
					"A legend among goblins says that chokers descended from a goblin band which, beset by hardship, turned to cannibalism. Youngsters in this tribe devoured their elders. Over time, the band degenerated. With the twisting of their minds came a reshaping of their bodies; their arms grew long and their fingers steely, enabling them to better grab and strangle prey. They no longer fed upon each other, but continued to crave the flesh of normal goblins.",
					"As mentioned earlier, chokers can be driven off if their would-be victims prove an able match in combat. In areas infested with chokers, goblins and dwarves also take advantage of the chokers' caution by making a lot of noise, pounding weapons on shields and the like, to scare the chokers away. This tactic sometimes backfires, however, as the noise tends to attract other, more dangerous monsters."

It has no neck, and a large head with broad flat features. Its legs are short and bowed, with wide flat feet. A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips. It smells faintly of clay. The golem can not speak, or make any noise. It walks and moves with a slow and clumsy gait, almost as if it were not in control over its actions.",

					"Cloud giants have muscular human builds and handsome, well-defined features. The typical cloud giant is 24 feet tall and weighs 11,500 pounds. Female cloud giants can be 1 to 2 feet shorter and 1,000 to 2,000 pounds lighter. Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from a milky-white tinged with blue to a light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass and their eyes are an iridescent blue.",
					"Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.",
					"A cloud giant's natural Armor Class is 14. Although they will wear no armor, these giants prize magical protection devices, and one in 20 will have such a device. Cloud giants dress in clothing made of the finest materials available and wear jewelry. Many of the giants consider their appearance an indication of their station; the more jewelry and the better the clothes, the more important the giant. Cloud giants also appreciate music, and the majority of giants are able to play one or more instruments (their favorite is the harp). Unlike most other giant races, cloud giants leave their treasure in their lairs, carrying with them only food, throwing rocks, 10-100 (10d10) coins, and a musical instrument.",

However, these clans know the location of 1d8 other clans and will band together with some of these clans for celebrations, battles, or to trade. These joined clans will recognize one among them to be their leader this is usually an older cloud giant who has magical abilities. One in 10 cloud giants will have spells equivalent to a 4th level wizard, and one in 20 cloud giants will be the equivalent of a 4th level cleric.",
					"If encountered in a lair, half will be immature giants. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of ogre. Rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and \"to hit\" rolls equal to that of a fire giant.",
					"The majority of cloud giants live on cloud-covered mountain peaks in temperate and sub-tropical areas. These giants make their lairs in crude castles. Only 10% of good cloud giants live in castles on enchanted clouds. All giants dwelling there are able to levitate their own weight plus 2,000 pounds three times a day, create a fog cloud three times a day, and create a wall of fog once a day. These abilities are performed as a 6th level wizard.",

Some cloud giant clans will establish good relations with such communities, and will come to the communities' aid if they are endangered. Evil cloud giants raid human and demi-human communities to get what they want."

					"The couatl are feathered serpents of myth and lore. It is believed that they are distant relatives of dragons, although this remains unproven.",
					"So rare as to be considered almost legendary, the couatl is one of the most beautiful creatures in existence. It has the body of a long serpent and feathered wings the color of the rainbow. Since it has the ability to change shape, the couatl will sometimes appear in the form of other creatures (always of good alignment).",
					"Couatl are able to communicate via telepathy with almost any intelligent creature which they encounter. In addition, they can speak common and most serpent and avian languages.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"This winged serpent is native to warm, jungle-like regions but can also be found flying through the ether. Their intelligence and goodness have made them objects of reverence by the natives of the regions which they inhabit. Considered to be divine, there are many legends in which the couatl is the benefactor of mankind and the bestower of such precious gifts as agriculture and medicine. There are even shrines in certain areas dedicated to the couatl, and any who attack or harm a couatl are automatically viewed as the blackest of villains.",
					"Although solitary in nature, couatl think of themselves as a single, extended clan. This clan is led by the oldest and wisest of their numbers but assembles only in dire emergencies.",
					"Most couatl dwell alone, making their lairs in caves and abandoned buildings in remote, uninhabited regions. They hunt jungle animals for food once every fortnight or so. Many enjoy traveling, often undertaking long journeys of exploration.",
					"On rare occasions, a pair will mate for life and establish a joint lair. Unlike many other reptiles, the couatl bear live young. Births are rare, averaging only one per couple each century. Both parents participate in the rearing and education of the single offspring, and will fight to the death if their child is threatened. Young couatl reach maturity in thirty or forty years and, though some will elect to remain with their parents for as long as a century, will eventually set off in search of the couatl's never-ending quest for wisdom.",
					"Intellectually curious, all couatl have vast stores of information and enjoy learning more. When one of them learns some new and fascinating fact he will inevitably set out in search of his brethren to share and discuss it.",
					"Couatl can sometimes be persuaded to help good adventurers or give sound council. If they feel that they are being sought for frivolous reasons, they will simply fly away. They are not greedy and do not seek treasure for its own sake. Aid from a couatl may well take the form of a magical item from its hoard.",
					"生态学",
					"The couatl usually reigns supreme in its jungle, having little to fear from most other monsters.",
					"Couatl is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Bless}, {@spell Guiding Bolt}"

					"CRAWLING's CLAW (reade the article)",
					"描述",
					"The much feared crawling claw is frequently employed as a guardian by those mages and priests who have learned the secret of its creation.",
					"No single description of a crawling claw is possible as they are not uniform in appearance. Since claws are the animated remains of hands or paws of living creatures, they are apt to be found in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Crawling claws are nothing more than the animated hands and paws of once-living creatures. As such, they have no culture or society to speak of. Despite this, crawling claws do have a limited ability to communicate with each other. This takes the form of a basic telepathic link between all the claws of a single \"batch\". Whenever one claw finds a victim, all of the others in the area who were made at the same time move in to help it.",
					"In addition, claws that have been instructed to do so can act in concert with each other to move large objects. The DM should use five pounds per claw as a reasonable limit to the weight that can be moved.",
					"生态学",
					"Crawling claws can be created by any mage or priest who has knowledge of the techniques required to do so. To begin with, the creator must assemble the severed limbs that are to animated. The maximum number of claws that can be created at any one time is equal to the level of the person enchanting them. The hands (or paws) can be either fresh, skeletal, or at any stage of decomposition in between.",
					"Claws can be controlled in one of two ways: directly or via programming. The manner of a claw's control must be specified when it is created and cannot be changed thereafter. All of the claws in a particular batch must be controlled in the same manner.",
					"Programmed claws are given a single, brief instruction that they attempt to carry out to the best of their ability. The maximum length of the programming, in words, is 15 plus the level of the creator. This programming sets the conditions under which the claw attack. A sample command might be: Kill anyone except me who opens this chest.",
					"Directly controlled claws are manipulated by the thoughts of their creator. The mental effort of controlling claws is quite tiring and cannot be maintained for more than three consecutive rounds without a one-round rest. Further, the range of such control is limited to 10 feet plus 5 feet per level of the creator. A person controlling claws cannot undertake spellcasting or any other activity. Injury to a controller does not break his control unless unconsciousness results. If direct control is broken for some reason, the claws continue to follow the last orders they were given."

					"描述",
					"The crocodile is a large, dangerous predatory reptile native to tropical and subtropical climes. It spends most of its time submerged in swamps, rivers, or other large bodies of water.",
					"The crocodile is one of the most feared and ugliest predators of the tropics. It has a long, squat body, ranging in size from a scant foot to well over ten feet long. Most mature specimens range from eight to 15 feet long, and some even larger. Many sages argue that crocodiles never stop growing. The crocodile has a long jaw filled with sharp, conical teeth. The powerful maw is superbly adapted for dragging prey beneath the water and dismembering it. Its four short legs are very powerful, and can propel the crocodile rapidly through the water and over the land. Its long tail is also very strong and is sometimes used on land to unbalance its foes.",
					"The crocodile is covered with a tough horny hide, which blends in very well with the surrounding water. Its eyes and nose are placed so that when the crocodile floats, only they remain above water, enabling the beast to spot and ambush prey. The crocodile is adept at floating through the water and remaining quite still, presenting the illusion that it is nothing more than a floating log.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Crocodiles sometimes congregate in large numbers, but they are not by nature sociable, nor do they cooperate in hunting. They have well-concealed lairs and will often drag their prey to their lairs before eating it. When a tasty morsel comes its way, a group of crocodiles will go into a feeding frenzy, each attempting to get a part of the feast. They hunt almost daily, primarily in the water, rarely on land. Their tastes are broad: fish, men, small mammals, aquatic birds, and even a careless lion has occasionally been known to fall into their grasp. Hungry crocodiles will sometimes upend boats to see what falls out.",
					"Crocodiles mate once a year, and the female lays a clutch of about 60 eggs, carefully burying them in the sand. Unlike many other reptiles, the female carefully guards her eggs, protecting them from other predators. When the time comes for the eggs to hatch, the mother assists by digging the eggs out of the sand. The newly hatched young are thrown entirely on their own resources to survive. Very few of the young survive to maturity.",
					"Swamps and rivers are not the only abode of the crocodile. In recent years there have been dreadful rumors that some of these reptiles have made their homes in the sewers of cities in tropical regions, living on waste and carrion.",
					"生态学",
					"The crocodile is a formidable predator and has little competition for food from other water creatures. One of the few monsters that can compete with it is the {@creature dragon turtle|AGGMM}. Even on the riverbanks it has little to fear from rival predators; most would prefer not to tangle with a crocodile. The only predator that the crocodile need fear is man, who hunts it for its tough hide, which can be transformed into a beautiful, gleaming leather. Crocodiles are also hunted to eliminate the danger that they represent to riverside communities."

According to Homer's Odysseus where he introduced likely the most famous Cyclops, Polyphemus, Cyclopes were the sons of {@link Poseidon|https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-p/poseidon-greek-avatar/}, not Gaea. Homer described the Cyclopes as wild savages, who abstained from agriculture and laws other than every man for himself. They were shepherds who lived in the southwestern part of Sicily, actively ate human beings and lived with their wives and children in caves ruling over them with arbitrary power. The Homeric Cyclopes were not servants of ",

					"Polyphemus was a man-eating monster with a bloody and barbaric story. He fell in love with a beautiful nymph called Galatea who rejected him in favour for a man named Acis. Polyphemus enraged by the rejection, threw Acis and killed him on a massive rock. The blood of Acis formed a stream, which still bears his name today. The Cyclops encounters Odysseus in Homer's tale where he is outwitted and blinded by the hero and turns the wrath of his father, Poseidon on Odysseus. Odysseus arrived on the island of the Cyclops on his way home to Ithica and led his men into a cave full of food unknowing of who the owner was. Polyphemus sealed the cave and the crew within it, eating a few of them. Odysseus managed to trick the Cyclops into getting drunk off of strong wine and told the monster his name was 'No One.' Polyphemus fell asleep, and the hero blinded him with a wooden stake, when the other giants came to help, Polyphemus told him 'No One' had attacked him, and so they left him. Odysseus and his men bound themselves to the bellies of Polyphemus's sheep and escaped when the giant let them out to graze. Odysseus could not help but boast about his victory over his defeated adversary and told Polyphemus his name which in turn led to Poseidon punishing him and causing him to deviate from his route home even more.",

					"A diminutive relative of true giants, cyclopskin are single-eyed giants that live alone or in small bands. The typical cyclopskin weighs around 350 pounds, and stands 7 feet tall. A single large, red eye dominates the center of its forehead.",
					"Shaggy black or dull, deep blue hair falls in a tangled mass about its head and shoulders, its skin tone varies from ruddy brown to muddy yellow, and its voice is rough and sharp. Cyclopskin commonly dress in ragged animal hides and sandals. They smell of equal parts dirt and dung.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The single-eyed humanoids shy away from organized settlements. If left alone, they tend to leave armed groups alone, though they are not above attacking a much weaker force if they stumble across one. Cyclopskin have no regard for any form of life other than themselves. Captives are either enslaved or eaten. This doesn't happen very often, since the cyclopskin tend to live in remote rocky places.",
					"They rarely wander more than 10 miles from their caves. Being poor hunters, most cyclopskin clans keep small herds of goats or sheep. Some clans are nomadic, while others stay put in their caves. Each spring, regional clans meet to exchange goods and slaves and to select mates. On rare occasions a charismatic cyclopskin will arise and bring together several clans to form a wandering tribe.",
					"The largest known tribe numbered around 80 fighting cyclopskin. Such a band will aggressively raid outlying areas with a boldness uncommon in a single clan. All group decisions are made by the strongest and toughest cyclopskin in the group, usually through intimidation. This in turn leads to brawls and fist fights. There are no rules in such fights, and they can lead to permanent injury or death for the loser.",
					"A cyclopskin cave is sealed with boulders and there is but one entrance. Inside, if size permits, there will be wooden pens to house both animals and slaves. The pens always have roofs of either wooden bars or the natural cave ceiling. At night, a large boulder or stout wooden gate is placed at the entrance of the cave to protect the cyclopskin from predators.",
					"There are no interior fire pits, since cyclopskin use fire infrequently, and then only outside their lairs. Any cyclopskin treasure will be kept in a sack in the cave.",
					"生态学",
					"Cyclopskin can survive on almost any animal or plant diet. They enjoy meat of all sorts and prize it above vegetable foods. While they live off the land, they do not live with it. They have absolutely no sanitary practices, and rarely even cook their meals. They take no care to preserve their environment while hunting, and are considered to be one of the easiest creatures of their size to track.",
					"The life of a cyclopskin is hazardous, and hence they have a short life expectancy. Besides human adventurers, there are many predators, such as tigers, giants, wyverns, and trolls, that are not above attacking a small group of these giants.",
					"Cyclopskin is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell True Strike}"

In the end, he or she is utterly corrupted by the gloom of the surrounding land.",

Their features are sunken and worn, making them look as if they had been far too long without nourishment. They dress much like other Vistani, save that they lose their taste for bright colors and tend to wear drab earth tones.",
					"Darklings want as little to do with true Vistani as possible, but often prey on normal men and their societies. They speak the common tongue of men and are generally familiar with a handful (3 to 6) other languages or dialects.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Having been cast out of the Vistani society for some crime or wrongful act, the darkling often gathers a band of human thugs around him and takes up a life of heinous crime and wandering brutality. While they are unable to cross the misty borders between the domains of Ravenloft, a darkling is said to know every stone and tree in the domain he dwells in. This imprisonment in a single domain is quite painful to a people as full of wanderlust as the Vistani and serves to fuel the evil desire for vengeance that burns in the darkling's heart.",
					"Often, a darkling will work toward some grand scheme which he feels will allow him to escape from the domain he is imprisoned in (or even from Ravenloft itself) and strike back at his former people in some way. Since the Vistani are in far better harmony with the environment than their darkling outcasts, such plans of vengeance are seldom anything but failures.",
					"Darklings often claim to retain more of their fortune telling power than they truly do. Predictions offered by them, however, are either lies or educated guesses.",
					"生态学",
					"The darkling lives either alone or as the leader of a small band of thugs and ruffians. He looks upon the Vistani as cruel people who have done him wrong and upon normal men as pawns and objects of prey. To the darkling, the world has committed a great wrong and now owes him a great debt. Thus, he looks upon all material things as his rightful property and takes what he needs without regard for the consequences of his actions.",
					"The death of a darkling usually (90%) draws the attention of the nearest Vistani group. Within a week, they arrive at the location of the demise, bury the body (if such is still available), and perform an ancient rite designed to soothe the spirit of their tortured brother and allow him to rest in eternal peace. If this ritual is not completed, there is a 90% chance that the darkling will return in 1d6 weeks as a {@creature ghast|AGGMM} (if the body is intact) or as a {@creature wraith|AGGMM4} (if the body has been destroyed. This undead creature will then hunt down those men who served it in life and kill them, transforming them into {@creature ghoul|AGGMM}s (if the darkling returns as a {@creature ghast|AGGMM}) or {@creature wight|AGGMM4}s (if it is a {@creature wraith|AGGMM4}). Thus, its evil band will again plague the lands."

					"描述",
					"The Death Kiss, or \"bleeder\", is fearsome predator found in caverns or ruins. Its spherical body resembles that of the dreaded {@creature beholder|AGGMM}, but the \"eyestalks\" of this creature are bloodsucking tentacles, its \"eyes\" hook-toothed orifices. They favor a diet of humans and horses, but will attack anything having blood (especially \"easy meals\" like bloodbloated {@creature stirge|AGGMM3}s and lone humans). An older name for these creatures is \"eye of terror\". A gigantic specimen known as The Tentacled One is said to roam the high forests and crags of the northern Sword Coast.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Bleeders prefer to float above surfaces rather than resting upon them. They move by means of levitation. A death kiss may \"shut itself down\", remaining motionless and insensitive on the ground, and remain alive in that state for long periods of time. To awaken from this hibernation, the creature requires an influx of electrical energy, considerable heat, or the internal shock caused by a blow, fall, wound, or magical attack; any of the above stimulants must deal at least 5 points of damage to the death kiss to wake it from its sleep. Adventurers finding a hibernating death kiss usually provide such stimulation, thinking the sleeper helpless prey. Unless they kill the death kiss before it wakes, all they do is provide the bleeder a meal upon its awakening.",
					"Eyes of terror are solitary hunters, fully inheriting the paranoia and ego of their cousins, the beholders. If they encounter one of their kin, the result is often a mid-air struggle to the death. The loser's body becomes an incubator and breeding ground for the death kiss. offspring. After the victor lays innumerable eggs within the corpse, the eggs suspended within a greenish fluid, 1d4 young \"hatch\" forth within a day. Each new bleeder has half its parent's hit points and size, and fully matures in 1 month. A death kiss's cavern or ruined chamber lair contains the treasure of its victims, often arranged in a trail to attract more prey.",
					"生态学",
					"Death Kisses prey upon larger creatures, providing a balance against the numbers of magical creatures who have no other natural foes. Death Kisses have little fear of any opponents, save dragons and other beholderkin.",
					"An organ in the upper central body of a death kiss is a valued ingredient in magical potions and spell inks concerned with levitation. Rumors tell of a little-known mage in Marsember who uses the eye of the death kiss to cure blindness, although the process grants only infravision. A brain or nerve node deep in a bleeder's body hardens into a gem-like, soft-sided but faceted red gem. Called \"blood-eyes\", these typically fetch a market price of 70 gp each. They are valued for adornment because they glow more brightly as the wearer's emotions become more intense."

Do not leave the chamber.) If no instructions are given to a new death tyrant, it attacks all living things it perceives. Death tyrants occur spontaneously in very rare instances. In most cases, they are created through the magic of evil beings from human mages to illithid villains. Some outcast, magic-using beholders have even been known to create death tyrants from their own unfortunate brethren.",
					"Death tyrants have no self-awareness or social interaction; they are mindless servants of more powerful masters. Mindless is a relative term; the once highly intelligent brains of death tyrants still use eyes skillfully to perceive and attack nearby foes. When a death tyrant is controlled by another being, consider it to have the intelligence of its controller.",
					"Death tyrants are created from dying beholders. A spell, thought to have been developed by human mages in the remote past, forces a beholder from a living to an undead state, and imprints its brain with instructions. Rogue death tyrants also exist: those whose instructions specifically enable them to ignore all controlling attempts. These are immune to the control attempts of all other beings. Beholders often leave them as traps against rivals.",

					"Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels, buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow, and mind flayers.",
					"Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin, wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored, usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.",
					"Svirfneblin mining teams and patrols work together so smoothly that to outside observers they appear to communicate with each other by some form of racial empathy. These small folk can also converse with any creature from the elemental plane of Earth via a curious \"language\" consisting solely of vibrations (each pitch conveys a different message), although only on a very basic level.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Svirfneblin society is strictly divided between the sexes: females are in charge of food production and running the city, while males patrol its borders and mine for precious stones. A svirfneblin city will have both a king and a queen, each of whom is independent and has his or her own sphere of responsibility. Since only males ever leave the city, the vast majority of encounters will be with deep gnome mining parties seeking for new lodes.",
					"For every four svirfneblin encountered, there will be a 4th level overseer.",
					"Groups of more than 20 will be led by a 6th level burrow warden with two 5th-level assistants.",
					"生态学",
					"Stealth, cleverness, and tenacity enable the svirfneblin to survive in the extremely hostile environment of the Underdark. They love gems, especially rubies, and will take great risks in order to gain them. Their affinity for stone is such that creatures from the elemental plane of Earth are 90% unlikely to harm a deep gnome, though they might demand a hefty tithe in gems or precious metals for allowing the gnome to escape."

					"This fast carnivore uses its speed, its long, grasping forearms, large teeth, and hind legs with their ripping talons in terrible combination. It hunts by running at prey, leaping, and raking with its rear claws as it claws and bites. The jump is a charge, so the creature gains a +2 on attack rolls. The rear talons count as only one attack, and cause a total of 2d6 damage. When attacking a larger creature, the deinonychus often jumps on top of it, and holds on with its front claws while continuing to rake with the rear claws.",
					"The deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics. Despite being 12 feet long, this dinosaur is only about 6 feet tall. Its tail extends straight out behind it, held aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its 150 pounds of weight to be carried entirely by the back legs.",
					"The deinonychus is a dromaeosaur, dinosaurs which are related to ornithomimosaurs; its distant relatives include the chicken-sized night hunter, compsognathus, and the ostrich-like struthiomimus. Neither is as formidable as the deinonychus."

					"描述",
					"The demilich is not, as the name implies, a weaker form of the lich. Rather, it is the stage into which a lich will eventually evolve as the power which has sustained its physical form gradually begins to fail. Inmost cases, all that remains of a demilich's body are a skull, some bones, and a pile of dust.",
					"When it has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the lich will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. Since it has no use for its physical body at this point, the lich leaves it to decay as it should have done centuries ago.",
					"If the final resting place of a demilich's remains are entered, the dust which was once its body will rise up and assume a man-like shape. In the case of the oldest demiliches (25%), the shape will advance and threaten, but dissipate without attacking in 3 rounds unless attacked. Younger demiliches (75%) still retain a link to their remains, however, and will form with the powers of a wraith. This dust form cannot be turned. In addition, it can store energy from attacks and use this power to engage its foes. If the dust form is attacked, each point of damage which is delivered to it is converted to an energy point. Since the demilich will fall back and seem to suffer injury from each attack (though none is actually inflicted), its attackers are likely to press on in their attempts to destroy it. Once the demilich has acquired 50 energy points, it will assume a manifestation which looks much like the lich's earlier undead form and has the powers and abilities of a ghost, but which cannot be turned.",
					"If anyone touches the skull it will rise into the air and turn to face the most powerful of the intruders (a spell user will be chosen over a non-spell user). Instantly, it unleashes a howl which acts as a death ray, affecting all creatures within a 20' radius of the skull. Those who fail to save vs. death are permanently dead.",
					"On the next round, the demilich will employ another manner of attack. In order to attain the status of a demilich, a lich must have replaced 5-8 (1d4+4) of its teeth with gems. Each of these gems now serves as a powerful magical device which can trap the soul of its adversaries. The physical body of someone hit with the demilich's spell collapses and rots away in a single round. Once it has drained the life essence from the most powerful member of the party, the skull sinks back to the floor. If it continues to be challenged, the demilich can repeat this attack until all of its gems are filled. An amulet of life protection will prevail over the gem, but the character's body will perish regardless.",
					"In addition to the attacks mentioned above, a demilich can also pronounce a powerful curse on those who disturb it. These can be so mighty as to include: always being hit by one's enemies, never making a saving throw, or the inability to acquire new experience points. Demilich curses can be overcome with a remove curse, but the victim loses one point of charisma permanently when the curse is removed.",
					"The skull of a demilich can be affected by spells in only a few ways: a forget spell will cause it to sink down without attacking (either by howling or draining a soul), a dispel evil will do 5-8 (1d4+4) points of damage to it, a shatter spell will inflict 3-18 (3d6) points of damage to it, a holy word pronounced against it will deliver 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and a power word kill spell cast by an ethereal or astral wizard will cause the skull to shatter (destroying it).",
					"Most weapons will be unable to harm the skull of a demilich, but there are exceptions. A fighter or ranger with a vorpal sword, sword of sharpness, sword +5, or vorpal weapon can inflict normal damage on the skull, as can a paladin with a vorpal or +4 weapon. Further, any character with a +4 or better weapon or a mace of disruption can inflict 1 point of damage to the skull each time he strikes it.",
					"Upon the destruction of the skull, those who have been trapped inside the gems must make a saving throw vs. spell. Those who fail are lost forever, having been consumed by the demilich to power its magical nature. If the character survives, the gem glows with a faint inner light, and true seeing will reveal a tiny figure trapped within. If the throw is made the soul can be freed by simply crushing the gem. A new body must be within 10 yards for the soul to enter or it will be lost. Such a body might be a clone or simulacrum. (See spells of those names.)",
					"If the fragments of the destroyed skull are not destroyed by immersion in holy water and the casting of a dispel magic the demilich will reform in 1-10 days."

Most derro wear a loose costume woven from the hair of underground creatures and dyed in deep reds and browns. Even in full armor, exploring new territory or patrolling their own, derro are easily recognizable. Their armor is leather, studded in copper and brass. Leaders, though, wear tougher leather armors, made from the hides of creatures far tougher than cattle.

Such a splinter group will travel quite a distance before settling down, as no two derro lairs have been spotted within several miles of each other. The two groups may communicate for a short time, in order to ensure the new lair's safety, but they soon sever all contacts and act utterly independently of one another.

Duergar disapprove of the derro's love of cruelty. And derro really don't much care about the other races deep beneath the surface. But derro often raid the surface and acquire technology or items that other deep races desire, and so limited trade between a lair and some surrounding creatures is possible.",
					"Every 20 years or so, the derro race mounts an all-out war against other creatures of the Underdark. This is known as the Uniting War, and no savant really expects to win it. The War is a means of winnowing out the weakest of the derro lairs, a focal point for racial identity, and a chance to really start some terror throughout the Underdark. It also serves the purpose of starting rumors. That is, humans will certainly hear that a war is being fought in the Underdark, and will send hundreds of scouting and adventuring parties into the deep underground to investigate. The derro welcome this new source of slaves.",

					"The derro also raid other races for food. Sometimes, they merely rob the dwarves or the orcs, hoping to provoke an amusing conflict. But such excursions are tame compared to Open Hunting, the derro term for midnight raids into human settlements. When Open Hunting, a derro party steals cattle and swine, to let loose and hunt at a later time, but it primarily kidnaps humans. As mentioned before, derro treasure humans for slaves and for breeding.",

					"Derro are a degenerate race of dwarven stature. They have dwelled in the Underdark for ages, but they were discovered by the mind flayers only five centuries ago, and by the drow but shortly before that. The derro have made a name for themselves by their marked cruelty. It is said that a derro lives for two things: the slow and humiliating death of surface demihumans and especially humans, and the perversion of knowledge for their own dark ends.",
					"Derro are short, with skin the color of an ice-covered lake (white, with bluish undertones), sickly pale yellow or tan hair (always straight), and staring, pupil-less eyes. Their features remind dwarves of humans, and vice versa. Derro have rough skin, spotted with short coarse tufts of hair. Most derro wear a loose costume woven from the hair of underground creatures and dyed in deep reds and browns. Even in full armor, exploring new territory or patrolling their own, derro are easily recognizable. Their armor is leather, studded in copper and brass. Leaders, though, wear tougher leather armors, made from the hides of creatures far tougher than cattle. Derro prefer weapons designed to cripple opponents, rather than those built for a quick kill: derro don't see any sport in spears and axes.",

					"The displacer beast is a magical creature that resembles a {@creature puma|AGGMM3} with two powerful black tentacles growing from its shoulders. Very rare, they stay far from human habitations.",
					"The displacer beast has the blue-black coloring of a dark panther,and a long cat-like body and head. Females range in length from 8 to 9 feet, and weigh 450 pounds; males are 10 to 12 feet long, and weigh up to 500 Lbs. They have 6 legs. Tentacles are tipped with rough horny edges that can inflict terrible wounds. Their eyes glow bright green, even after death.",
					"战斗",
					"The displacer beast tries to catch by surprise its victims using its stealth, and then attack using its tentacles to weaken the closest target.",
					"A target trying to get in close combat with the displacer beast is subject to attack of opportunity from the tentacles. The displacer beast can make up to two attacks of opportunity in a round of combat.",
					"If, after the first round of combat none of the targets is down, the displacer beast will withdraw only to come back later and catch the targets again by surprise.",
					"The displacer beast can attempt to disarm an opponent withits tentacles. If it scores a successful hit roll with a -4 penalty, the target is disarmed but suffer no damage. If the hit roll to attempt to disarm the opponent is a natural 20, then the displacer beast grabs the weapon.",
					"The displacer beast is intelligent enough to understand that a disarmed opponent is a vulnerable target. The creature may decide to withdraw with the weapons and return later to finish the victim.",
					"The displacer beast avoids entering close combat with teeth and claws, doing so only if cornered or with no way to escape.",
					"Suggested. The displacement effect can be nullified with a {@spell True Seeing} spell.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Displacer beasts are carnivores. Unless they are raising young, they usually run in packs, carving a savage swath of destruction as they go. They hate all life, and will sometimes kill purely for pleasure. Fierce and vicious as they are, however, displacer beasts never fight among themselves. The pack is a well-run and highly efficient killing machine. When encountered in packs, displacer beasts are more than a match for many large creatures and have been known to make a meal of {@creature orc|AGGMM3}s, {@creature goblin|AGGMM}s, and bands of men. Any creature entering their territory is viewed as potential prey.",
					"Displacer beasts mate in the autumn, and the young are born in spring. A mated pair of displacer beasts makes its home in a cave, producing litters of 1d4 young. The cubs, about the size of domestic cats, are born without tentacles and reach maturity, though not full size, within 4 months.",
					"They remain in the cave until their displacement abilities are fully developed. This is followed by a two month period during which the cubs are taught how to hunt. When this is completed, the family group disbands and the monsters wander off to join separate packs.",
					"While raising young, the monsters are fiercely protective of their lairs. One adult always remains with the cubs, usually the female, while the other goes off to hunt. Dead prey is dragged back to the lair to be eaten by the family. Lairs are littered with the bones, equipment, and the treasures of its victims.",
					"Naturally vicious and almost evil at times, displacer beasts harbor an undying hatred of blink dogs. Many theories attempt to account for this enmity. Some sages believe it springs from antipathy in temperaments the lawful good blink dog would naturally be the enemy of a creature as savage and destructive as the displacer beast.",

Encounters between the two breeds are rare however, since they do not share the same territory.",

					"Displacer beasts have little to fear from other large predators, save perhaps trolls or giants. Some wizards and alchemists value their hides for use in certain magical preparations, and will offer generous rewards for them.

					"DOPPELGANGER's TACTICS (read the article)",
					"描述",
					"The doppelganger is a master of mimicry that survives by taking the shapes of men, demihumans, and humanoids. Doppelgangers are bipedal and generally humanoid in appearance. Their bodies are covered with a thick, hairless gray hide, which gives them a natural AC of 14. They are, however, rarely seen in their true forms.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Doppelgangers are rumored to be artificial beings that were created long ago by a powerful wizard or godling. They were originally intended to be used as spies and assassins in an ancient, highly magical war. Their creator died long ago, but they live on, still working as spies for evil powers, thieves, and government. They have even been known to work as assassins.",
					"All dopplegangers belong to a single tribe. Although this is rare, groups of doppelgangers can be found anywhere at any time, and in unexpected locations. Working as a unit, they select a group of victims, such as a family or a group of travelers. Basically lazy, doppelgangers find it easier to survive and live comfortably by taking humanoid, and especially human, shape. They prefer to take the form of someone comfortably provided for, and shun assuming the form of hardworking peasants. Since they are only 90% accurate in their mimicry, most doppelgangers are eventually discovered and driven out, and then forced once more to assume a new shape.",
					"Doppelgangers are found most often in their true forms in a dungeon or in the wilderness. Groups often set up a lair in an area well-suited to ambush and surprise, patrolling a regular territory. These bands make a good living by attacking weak humanoid monsters or travelers and stealing their food and treasure. If food and treasure are scarce, they hire out to a powerful wizard or thieves' guild.",
					"A doppelganger who has been hired to replace a specific person will plan its attack with special care, learning as much about the victim and his environment as it can.",
					"The doppelgangers' weaknesses are greed and cowardice. They spend their lives in avid pursuit of gold and other wealth. If attacking a group of adventurers, for example, they often choose the richest-looking one to attack first. If they target a party of adventurers, the doppelgangers wait until the party is on the way out of the dungeon and heading back to town. Since they are cowardly, however, they prefer to take the easiest route toward riches. A doppelganger who chooses a rich adventurer avoids risks once the treasure is safely in hand, and retreats at the earliest opportunity, making some plausible excuse for separating from the human members of the group. They sometimes hire out as spies and assassins for money as well.",
					"生态学",
					"Doppelgangers are sophisticated and dangerous parasites, living off the labors of others. They must also be reckoned with as clever and effective spies and assassins who can wreak political mayhem in positions of power. Evil wizards have on rare occasions controlled entire kingdoms for short periods of time by replacing a king, prince, or councilor with a doppelganger."

					"When a dragon turtle surfaces, it is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the water. The turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell are patterned like light dancing on open water.",
					"The turtle's legs and tail are of a lighter green, and they are flecked with golden highlights. The coloration of the creature's head is similar to the legs and tail, but its crest spines are golden with dark green webbing connecting them.",
					"A dragon turtle's shell can reach to 30 feet in diameter, and an adult turtle can measure over 40 feet from its snout to the tip of its tail.",
					"Dragon turtles speak their own highly-developed language.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Dragon turtles are extremely solitary creatures. Large, desolate sea caves and secret underground caverns that can be accessed only through the water are their favorite lairs. These lairs are difficult to find, but adventurers locating a dragon turtle's cave will find it filled with treasures of all types. The turtle gathers this treasure, which it will protect to the death, from the ships sunk in its territory.",
					"A dragon turtle's territory is well-defined and may cover as much as fifty square miles of open water. Other dragon turtles are allowed into this area only during mating season, though turtles of the same sex will always fight to the death upon meeting. It is this hostility toward their own kind that keeps the number of dragon turtles relatively low.",
					"Mariners of any experience recognize the territorial claims of dragon turtles and will often make extravagant tributes to the turtle controlling areas necessary for safe and speedy trade.",
					"生态学",
					"Dragon turtles are carnivorous and will eat almost any creature, including humans or other dragon turtles, to satisfy their voracious appetite. Large fish seem to be the prefered food for dragon turtles, and the turtles can often be found lurking in the weeds and muck at the bottom of a lake or sea waiting for fish to pass. In particularly poor years for fish, dragon turtles have been known to use their breath weapon to kill large groups of sea birds that stray too close to the water for food.",
					"Conflict often arises between dragon turtles and the many intelligent aquatic races, like the locathah or mermen, because of competition for ideal lairs. Like many of their land-based relatives, dragon turtles are considered treacherous and selfish by all creatures that share their domain.",
					"Dragon turtle shells make outstanding shields and armor. Because of the shell's strength and natural resistance to the dragon turtle's own breath weapon, armor or a shield made out of this material gains +1 non-magical bonus to armor class."

					"Dryads are beautiful, intelligent tree sprites. They are as elusive as they are alluring, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise or they wish to be spotted.",
					"The dryad's exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are much like an elf maiden's. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad's complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a dryad's hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color. This enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad's hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves.",
					"When encountered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad's skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.",
					"Dryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear. They speak their own tongue, as well as the languages of elves, pixies, and sprites. Dryads can also speak with plants.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Some legends claim that dryads are the animated souls of very old oak trees. Whether this is really the case, it is true that dryads are attached to a single, very large oak tree in their lifetimes and cannot, for any reason, go more than 360 yards from that tree. If a dryad does wander farther away, she becomes weak and dies within 6d6 hours unless returned to her home. The oak trees of dryads do not radiate magic, but someone finding a dryad's home has great power over her. A dryad suffers damage for any damage inflicted upon her home tree. Any attack on a dryad's tree will, of course, bring on a frenzied defense by the dryad.",
					"Although dryads are generally very solitary, up to six have been encountered in one place. This is rare, however. All this really means is that a number of dryad oaks are within 100 yards of one another and the dryads' paths cross. These dryads may come to each other's aid, but never really gather socially. Any treasure owned by a tree sprite is hidden close to her home tree. The gold and gems that make up a dryad's treasure are almost always the gifts of charmed adventurers.",
					"These tree sprites realize that most humans and demihumans fear them for their ability to charm, so dryads only deal with strangers on rare occasions. When approached carefully, however, dryads have been known to aid adventurers. They are a useful source of information, too, as they know a great deal about the area in which they live.",
					"生态学",
					"Dryads are staunch protectors of the forest and groves in which they reside. Any actions that harm the area, and especially its plant life, are met with little tolerance.",

					"The duergar are similar to other dwarves cultures, although the life is much harsher due to their hostile environment deep under the ground. They do not venture into the surface except at night or on the gloomiest days. Duergar live longer than their surface-dwelling kin. Life spans can reach 400 years or more.",
					"Duergar lairs are always deep underground. These are elaborate collection of chambers, passages, rooms, and secret areas. There is a chance a monster is kept as a guardian for the lair complex. Such a creature is probably kept at an entrance to the duergar complex or kept within the treasure cave.",

					"The duergar are not as affluent as other dwarven races. Individuals may have a few gold or platinum coins stashed away. Normal, usable items like weapons or armor are immediately distributed. Magical items and the bulk of the acquired treasure is stored in a well-protected chamber deep in the duergar complex.",

Even then, duergar may discreetly follow the travelers to see what they are up to and, if treasure is involved, to steal such riches for themselves.",

					"Eagles are majestic birds of prey, rarely used for hunting, but often sought after for their beauty and legendary courage.",
					"Eagles are large birds, usually standing around three feet tall. with distinctive feathering on their legs. Their wing span is an impressive six to seven feet. Eagles are usually brown in color, ranging from the blackish brown of the golden eagle to the dark brown of the bald eagle. They always sport a set of razor-sharp talons and a beak, equally as sharp and turned down abruptly at its point. The eagle's cry is high and shrill.",
					"战斗",
					"An eagle typically attacks from great heights, folding back its wings and letting gravity hurtle it toward its prey. If an eagle dives for more than 100 feet, its diving speed is double its normal flying speed and the eagle is restricted to attacking with only its two sets of claws. However, these high-speed attacks gain advantage on hit rolls and score double damage.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"High rocky cliffs and tall, broad trees are the favorite nesting spots for eagles. Once an eagle builds a nest, it will keep that home, adding it with each passing season, until the nest is destroyed or the eagle dies. There is always a 50% chance that 1d4 eggs are present in a nest. If eggs are not present, there is a 20% chance that 1d4 young eagles are present instead. There is always a 10% chance that the eagle is storing some small, shiny objects in the nest (like gold coins or gems).",
					"Eagles are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Eagles mate for life and, since they nest in one spot each year, it is easy to identify places where eagles are normally present. On occasion, in an area of especially rich feeding, 1d8+4 eagles are encountered instead of the normal individual or pair. This fertile area can support more than one nest, so more eagles move into the area.",
					"生态学",
					"Eagles are carnivores and generally hunt rodents, fish, and other small animals. Eagles have also been known to feed on the carrion of recently killed creatures, as well. Unless exceptionally hungry, an eagle will never attack a humanoid, though small creatures like tiny and small fey have to be wary of a hunting eagle mistaking them for rabbits.",
					"Eagles are not easy to train for hunting purposes. Nevertheless, a thriving market for eaglets and eagle eggs means that each one captured brings a price of 60 to 100 gold. Eagle feathers and other eagle tokens are also valued highly by many adventurers, as they wrongly believe the eagle's courage to be transferred to them by possession of such items."

					"Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders. These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps very deadly traps much like the spiders that often live around them.",
					"Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick. Ettercaps' heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth. The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth.",
					"Ettercaps do not have a formal language. They express themselves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, shrieks, and violent actions.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Ettercaps prefer to dwell in the deepest part of a forest, near paths that are frequented by game or travelers. The creatures' nests are made of a frame of strands filled with rotting leaves and moss. The lairs are often located on the ground, but can also be found up in large, sturdy trees. No treasure is to be found in ettercap lairs, but occasionally items dropped by adventurers who have fallen into ettercap traps are found nearby.",
					"Though usually only one ettercap is encountered at any time, on rare occasions a pair of ettercaps can be found together. The pairs encountered are always mated couples, though the female and male appear to be identical. Ettercap young are abandoned as soon as they are born, so adults are never encountered with young.",
					"生态学",
					"An ettercap eats any meat, regardless of the type of creature from which it comes. Upon capturing a victim, the ettercap poisons it so it cannot escape; once the creature is dead, the ettercap immediately devours as much of the corpse as possible. Typically, an ettercap can consume an entire deer or a large humanoid in a single sitting. Anything remaining after the ettercap has gorged itself is left for scavengers.",
					"Often (40%), 2d4 spiders of some monstrous type are found cooperating with an ettercap. The ettercap uses any giant spider webs available when it designs its traps. Creatures killed by an ettercap in the web of a giant spider are shared with the spider instead of being devoured entirely by the ettercap.",
					"Ettercap poison is highly valued, partly because of its extreme toxicity and partly because it is rather difficult to obtain. An ettercap's poison glands hold only one ounce of poison at any time, but this ounce is worth up to 1,000 gp on the open market.",

					"描述",
					"Ettins, or two-headed giants, as they are often called, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk by night and eat any meat they can catch.",
					"An ettin at first appears to be a stone or hill giant with two heads. On closer inspection, however, the creature's vast differences from the relatively civilized giant races become readily apparent. An ettin has pink to brownish skin, though it appears to be covered in a dark brown hide.",
					"This is because an ettin never bathes if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime. Its skin is thick, giving the ettin its low Armor Class. An ettin's hair is long, stringy, and unkempt; its teeth are large, yellowing, and often rotten.",
					"The ettin's facial features strongly resemble those of an orc large watery eyes, turned-up piggish snout, and large mouth. An ettin's right head is always the dominant one, and the right arm and leg will likely appear slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left. An ettin wears only rough, untreated skins, which are dirty and unwashed.",
					"Obviously, ettins smell very bad, due to their complete lack of grooming habits good or bad.",
					"Ettins do not have a true language of their own. Instead, they speak a mish-mash of orc, goblin, giant dialects, and the alignment tongue of chaotic evil creatures. Any adventurer who speaks orcish can understand 50% of what an ettin says.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote, rocky areas. They dwell in dark, underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal. Ettins are generally solitary, and mated pairs only stay together for a few months after a young ettin is born to them.",
					"Young ettins mature very quickly, and within eight to ten months after they are born, they are self-sufficient enough to go off on their own.",
					"On rare occasions, however, a particularly strong ettin may gather a small group of 1d4 ettins together. This small band of ettins stays together only as long as the leader remains alive and undefeated in battle.",
					"Any major defeat shatters the leader's hold over the band, and they each go their separate ways. Ettins collect treasure only because it can buy them the services of goblins or orcs. These creatures sometimes serve ettins by building traps around their lairs, or helping to fight off a powerful opponent.",
					"Ettins have also been known to occasionally keep cave bears in the area of their lairs. The sloppy caves of ettins are a haven for parasites and vermin, and it isn't unusual for the ettins themselves to be infected with various parasitic diseases. Adventurers rummaging through ettin lairs for valuables will find the task disgusting, if not dangerous.",
					"生态学",
					"Because ettin society is so primitive, they produce little of any value to civilized creatures. Ettins tolerate the presence of other creatures, like orcs, in the area of their lair if they can be useful in some way. Otherwise, ettins tend to be violently isolationist, crushing trespassers without question."

					"描述",
					"Flumph resemble aerial jellyfish. These odd creatures are round and almost flat, perhaps the or four inches thick in the center, tapering to one or two inches near the edge. The body is mostly hollow, much like a large cushion. A round orifices is in the center of the upper surface, flanked by two eyestalks, each about six inches long. Several short tentacles hang from the creature's underside, concealing a mass of small spikes. The tentacles closest to the flumph's rim can be used for fine manipulation of small objects. A common flumph is pure white in color; a monastic flumph is generally a pale yellow or green, with darker tentacles.",
					"A flumph flies by taking in air through the hole on its upper surface, and expelling it through several small holes on its underside. The creature also has several small apertures along its equator, for use in maneuvering. It usually hovers about four to six inches above the ground. Keeping its body aloft does not require great amounts of air. It creates a gentle breeze, and a slight whistling sound can be heard in a quiet area.",
					"Common flumphs cannot communicate vocally, but have a unique sign language that makes use of their tentacles and eyestalks. Some monastic flumphs, perhaps 10%, can speak and understand common or another language.",
					"战斗",
					"The flumph survives by hunting small creatures, such as rats, lizards, frogs, and the like. The flumph hovers along just above the ground, or hangs motionless in reeds or similar concealment. When it finds a small creature, it rises a foot or two, then drops onto its prey, its spikes inflicting 1d4 +2 points of piercing damage on a successful attack.",
					"In addition, the flumphs tentacles secrete digestive acids into the wounds; the acid causes an additional 1d4 points of acid damage each round. Once the prey is dead, the flumph settles on it and absorbs nutrients through its tentacles. Flumphs often need to pursue their healthier prey for a short distance before the victim dies. The acid can be washed away by complete immersion in a fast-moving stream, by actively washing the acid away (full round action) with a {@spell Create Food and Water|PHB|Create Water} spell (simple immersion or rinsing will not work) or by a {@spell Lesser Restoration} cast on the target.",
					"If threatened by a larger creature, the flumph usually attempts to drive it away by squirting a foul-smelling liquid from an orifice on its equator, in the front. If this method of repulsion fails, the flumph can rise to a height of 10 feet and drop onto an opponent, as if hunting.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The common flumph is a nomadic hunter, intelligent, good-aligned, and peaceful. A flumph reproduces about every two years by budding, producing 1d8 tiny flumphs on its underside. These become independent after about three months when they reach two inches in diameter. They grow to adult size within a month, and live for 20 years.",
					"生态学",
					"Flumphs are predators low on the food chain, feeding on smaller creatures and clearing their area of vermin. Flumph flesh has a foul taste, and they are generally considered unpalatable, though ogres and some goblinoids will eat them.",
					"Monastic Flumphs",
					"The seldom-seen monastic flumphs are more advanced creatures that can cast spells as if they were clerics of levels equal to their Hit Dice. They gather in cloisters to share knowledge and to worship deities unknown to humanoids. A cloister is usually in a large cavern or (in swamps and grasslands) a large, nest-like bower constructed of grass and mud. The inside of a cloister is decorated with fine, colorful paintings, made by flumphs dabbing natural pigments with their tentacles. The paintings are usually abstract, showing spirals and other curved lines, though some are vaguely representational of flumphs engaged in hunting.",
					"Each cloister is led by an {@creature abbot flumph|AGGMM}.",
					"The abbot is aided by one {@creature prior flumph} per six flumphs in the cloister.",
					"The remainder of the flumphs are {@creature monk flumph|AGGMM}.",
					"On occasion, a small group of common flumphs can be found near a cloister, bringing food as an offering in return for healing or guidance."

In the hot lands, tales abound of lizardfolk and yuan-ti who train flying snakes to hunt for them, or learn to work with the snakes as partners.",

					"战斗",
					"Flying snakes bite and slash with their needle-sharp fangs, or spit acid at opponents up to 10 feet away. An acid spit does 1d4 acid damage to tissue, hide or cloth, but does not affect metal or stone.",
					"Flying fangs always strike at the faces of their foes, seeking to blind beings so they can be slain and devoured at the fangs' leisure. The snakes will attack any living creature they feel they can slay and eat.",
					"Against small sized or smaller creatures, a flying snake can grasp and encoil its victim. This does no damage, but lowers the victim's speed to 5 feet and remove the dexterity bonus on armor class. To wrap its coils around an opponent, a flying snake must make a successful attack roll. Allow one attempt once every other round of combat as an extra attack roll.",
					"生态学",
					"A single flying snake eats five times its weight in a day, if it can get that much. Hunting flights often slay a dozen man-sized victims or more if they judge that other predators will leave the bodies undisturbed, for later meals."

The froghemoth's 18-foot-long, 10-foot-wide body is yellow on the belly, shading to a light green on its sides and a mottled green on its back and thick, bowed rear legs. Two tentacles sprout from each shoulder. The tentacles are 15 feet or more long, green on top and yellowish underneath. The creature's nostrils are stalk-like, and its three eyes are housed on a protruding, retractable appendage that can be withdrawn. Its eyes are amber with a green tinge and have vertical slit pupils of bright green edged with orange.",
					"When it is submerged, its tentacles trailing ashore and its eye and nostril stalks at water level, it appears to be nothing more than a plant growth of some sort.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"A froghemoth lives only in large swamps or in shallow fresh water (100 feet or less). It can operate on dry land, but it moves in a series of awkward hops at half speed.",
					"Once every nine years, froghemoths retum to their spawning ground to mate with others of their ilk. Every pair lays 10 to 100 eggs, each about a foot long, in shallow water. The tadpoles are immediately left to fend for themselves.",
					"Immature froghemoths (tadhemoths) resemble fish (2 HD; AC 16) with four pectoral fins (which will turn into tentacles) and two tails (which will turn into legs). For 6 months, the creatures grows about a foot per month, then gains about a foot every 2 months until it reaches full size. At 6 months, the tentacles start to develop. By the 10th month the legs start to develop, and by the 12th month the tadhemoth stage has ended. Tadhemoths eat and are eaten by each other, only 10% survive more than a few days after hatching, and only 1% to 4% reach adult size. Barring violent death, froghemoths are thought to live up to 100 years.",
					"生态学",
					"The froghemoth is very likely the dominant predator in its home region. Only very powerful creatures (like dragons or well-equipped adventurers) can hope to succeed against one. Froghemoth tadpoles cannot be trained, but it may be possible to capture one and move it someplace where it can act as a vicious and somewhat unreliable guard animal."

					"While galeb duhr seem to have no visible culture above ground, they are known to collect gems, which they find through their passwall ability. They sometimes have small magical items in their possession, evidently taken from those who attacked them to take their gems.",
					"The \"music\" of the galeb duhr often provides the first evidence that these creatures are near and usually the only evidence, as the unsociable galeb duhr are quick to pass into the ground when they feel the vibrations of approaching visitors.",
					"Sitting together in groups, the galeb duhr harmonize their gravelly voices into eldritch tunes; some sages speculate that these melodies can cause or prevent earthquakes. Others argue that the low rumbling produced by these creatures is a form of warning to others in the group, but there is no conclusive evidence either way.",
					"生态学",
					"Galeb duhr have no natural enemies, other than those who crave the gems they collect. Galeb duhr eat rock, preferring granite to other types, and disdaining any sedimentary type. The rocks they eat become part of the huge creatures; such a meal need take place only once every two or three months.",
					"Besides the gems that they carry with them, galeb duhr are likely to know where many other gems are, as well as veins of precious metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum, though galeb duhr seem to have no interest in these minerals for themselves. A few powerful mages have been able to bargain with the galeb duhr for this information. This is a difficult agreement to consummate, for the galeb duhr are valiant fighters, and usually have no difficulty in escaping from any harm if they are inclined to do so. Further, the galeb duhr are territorial, and would be irritated at any attempt to make use of this knowledge in their vicinity.",

A creature that meets the gaze of the central eye must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell, with a -2 penalty, or be affected as if the victim of a feeblemind spell.",
					"If a gauth chooses to bite with its great maw, the sharp fangs inflict {@dice 3d4} points of damage. The four tendrils around the mouth can grab and hold victims as if they had a Strength of 18, but they can inflict no damage.",
					"A gauth in combat can also employ its six eye stalks.",
					"Perhaps the most feared of the gauth's powers, its dweomer drain, permits the gauth to drain charges from magical items. It has a 40-foot range and can be targeted on one individual per round. In addition to preventing one object from functioning for the duration of that round, this power drains one charge from one charged object. Permanent objects, such as magical swords, are rendered powerless for one round by this ability. Artifacts are not affected by the dweomer drain. The eye has no effect on spells that have been memorized (but not yet cast) and it will not break the concentration of a wizard. It does neutralize any spell cast by its target that round, however.",
					"A {@spell dispel magic} spell cast on any of the gauth's eye stalks prevents its use for {@dice 1d4} rounds. The central eye, any fully retracted eye stalks, the body's ability to glow, and the gauth's natural levitation are not subject to injury by such a spell.",
					"If a gauth is slain, its magical energy dissipates. Usually, this is a harmless event, but there is a 2% chance that it is catastrophic, inflicting {@dice 4d4} points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet (no saving throw). Gauth are immune to their own powers and to those of other gauth. They have an unusual physiology that enables them to regenerate 1 hit point every two turns.",
					"Although gauth are not known to fight over territories or prey, they do go to great lengths to avoid each other. Even when they encounter another of their kind in the wilderness, they often ignore them utterly.",
					"A gauth can survive by eating meat but it greatly prefers to devour magical objects. In some unknown manner, the creature is able to absorb magical energy and feed on it. Each turn that an object spends in the gauth's stomach causes it to lose one charge. A permanent object is rendered inoperative after one day (artifacts are not affected, nor do they provide sustenance). Magical objects that cannot be entirely digested by a gauth are spat out after they have been drained of all their power.",
					"Gauth are thought to live a century or so. Within a week of their natural death, two young gauth emerge from the corpse. Although smaller than their parent (each has 2 or 3 HD and a bite that causes only {@dice 2d4} points of damage), they have all the powers of a full-grown adult."

					"Ghosts are the spirits of humans who were either so greatly evil in life or whose deaths were so unusually emotional they have been cursed with the gift of undead status. Thus, they roam about at night or in places of darkness. These spirits hate goodness and life, hungering to draw the living essences from the living.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"In most cases, a ghost is confined to a small physical area, which the ghost haunts. Those who have heard stories of a haunted area can thus attempt to avoid it for their own safety.",
					"A ghost often has a specific purpose in its haunting, sometimes trying to \"get even\" for something that happened during the ghost's life. Thus a woman who was jilted by a lover, and then committed suicide, might become a ghost and haunt the couple's secret trysting place. Similarly, a man who failed at business might appear each night at his storefront or, perhaps, at that of a former competitor.",
					"Another common reason for an individual to become a ghost is the denial of a proper burial. A ghost might inhabit the area near its body, waiting for a passerby to promise to bury the remains. The ghost, in its resentment toward all life, becomes an evil creature intent on destruction and suffering.",
					"In rare circumstances, more than one ghost will haunt the same location. The classic example of this is the haunted ship, a vessel lost at sea, now ethereal and crewed entirely by ghosts. These ships are most often encountered in the presence of St. Elmo's fire, an electrical discharge that causes mysterious lights to appear in the rigging of a ship.",
					"In many cases, a ghost can be overcome by those who might be no match for it in combat simply by setting right whatever events led to the attainment of the ghost's undead status. For example, a young woman who was betrayed and murdered by someone who pretended to love her might be freed from her curse if the cad were humiliated and ruined. In many cases, however, a ghost's revenge will be far more demanding, often ending in the death of the offender.",
					"生态学",
					"The dreadful fear caused by the ghost, which ages a victim 10 years, is not well understood by the common man, who often ascribes it to the fact that a ghost is \"dead\". If this were the case, then certainly skeletons and zombies would have the same effect, which they do not.",
					"Common folklore further confuses this fact by relating details of the ghost's physical form: the classic example of which is the headless horseman, thought by many to be particularly frightening simply because he had no head. Under this belief, one could face a ghost if only one had the courage to stand up to him. Such a mistaken impression has cost many lives over the years.

					"One of the things that makes the centipede so repulsive is its resemblance to the worm. Its long body is divided into many segments from which protrude many tiny feet. Hence the name \"centipede\" (or hundred-footed). The giant centipede is so named because it is over 1-foot long. The body is plated with a chitinous shell and it moves with a slight undulating motion. The creature has the added benefit of protective coloration, and varies in color depending on the terrain it inhabits. Those that favor rocky areas are gray, those that live underground are black, while centipedes of the forest are brown or red.",
					"战斗",
					"When hunting, centipedes use their natural coloration to remain unseen until they can drop on their prey from above or crawl out of hiding in pursuit of food. They attack by biting their foes and injecting a paralytic poison.",
					"Although a single giant centipede rarely constitutes a serious threat to a man, these creatures frequently travel in groups. When more than one centipede is encountered, the monsters will fight independently, even to the point of fighting among themselves over fallen victims.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The centipede behaves like most other insects, roving from place to place in search of food; it has no set territory or dwelling. The centipede simply goes where its hunger leads it. It is an aggressive and hungry carnivore that must eat at least once a day to survive. Hungry centipedes often resort to cannibalism.",
					"生态学",
					"Giant centipedes have several natural advantages, including poison and protective coloration, allowing them to compete with other small predators for game. Their poison bestows a certain immunity from being hunted, but hungry and skilled animals such as coyotes and large predatory birds hunt them effectively in lean times.",
					"Their preferred targets are small mammals that are easily overcome by their weak poison. If they are very hungry, however, they have been known to attack anything that moves, including humans."

However, if a giant eagle dives more than 50 feet, it gains advantage to its attack roll and doubles its normal talon damage.",
					"Giant eagles build their nests only in high mountain passes, where they have room to fly undisturbed. They are far more social than wild eagles, and up to 20 have been discovered nesting in the same area. One nest will be found for each pair of giant eagles. There is a 50% chance that 1d4 eggs are present in a nest, or a 25% chance of 1d4 young. If there are young or eggs in the nest, the giant eagle will attack any creature within 50 feet of the nest. Eagles are always suspicious of any creature coming near a nest, whether eaglets are present or not, as this is where their treasure is to be found.",
					"Some individual dwarves and elves and sometims even groups of dwarves and elves are considered friends by giant eagles. Members of the two races are considered less of a threat than humans. Giant eagles can be trained, and their eggs sell for 500 to 800 gp each on the open market."

					"Giant beetles are similar to their more ordinary counterparts, but thousands of times larger with chewing mandibles and hard wings that provide substantial armor protection.",
					"Beetles have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. Fortunately, the wings of a giant beetle cannot be used to fly, and in most cases, its six bristly legs do not enable it to move as fast as a fleeing man. The hard, chitinous shell of several varieties of these beetles are brightly colored, and sometimes have value to art collectors. While their shells protect beetles as well as plate mail armor, it is difficult to craft armor from them, and a skilled alchemist would need to be brought in on the job.",
					"All beetles are basically unintelligent and always hungry. They will feed on virtually any form of organic material, including other sorts of beetles. They taste matter with their antennae, or feelers; if a substance tasted is organic, the beetle grasps it with its mandibles, crushes it, and eats it. Because of the thorough grinding of the mandibles, nothing eaten by giant beetles can be revived by anything short of a wish. Beetles do not hear or see well, and rely primarily on taste and feel.",
					"Except as noted below, giant beetles are not really social animals; those that are found near each other are competitors for the same biological niche, not part of any family unit.",
					"The smallest of the giant beetles, fire beetles are nevertheless capable of delivering serious damage with their powerful mandibles. They are found both above and below ground, and are primarily nocturnal.",
					"战斗",
					"Despite its name, the fire beetle has no fire attacks, relying instead on its huge mandibles to inflict the damage of a short sword in a single attack.",
					"生态学",
					"Fire beetles have two special glands above their eyes and one near the back of their abdomens. These glands produce a luminous red glow, and for this reason they are highly prized by miners and adventurers. This luminosity persists for 1d6 days after the glands are removed from the beetle, and the light shed will illuminate a radius of 10 feet.",
					"The light from these glands is cold it produces no heat. Many mages and alchemists are eager to discover the secret of this cold light, which could be not only safe, but economical, with no parts to heat up and burn out. In theory, they say, such a light source could last forever.",

					"战斗",
					"A sea horse can normally attack only with a head butt, but a sea horse trained by locathah or aquatic elves as a steed can also use its long, curling tail to constrict and restrain enemies. The sea horse must be ridden in order to properly obey the command to constrict and then must make a successful attack roll. A captured opponent can free itself with a successful DC 13 Athletic check.",
					"The tail of a giant sea horse is so long that it can attack the same opponent that the head butts, or the one its rider is attacking, without penalty. The length of the tail also constricts the entire body of any medium or smaller creature, making spellcasting or melee fighting impossible for constricted creatures. The constriction causes no damage, but the sea horse can still choose to butt the helpless victim if so desired.",
					"Note that underwater combat is three-dimensional and sea horses instinctively use this advantage against creatures that are obviously out of their environment, like most humanoids. Sea horse riders take great pains to develop this instinct in their mounts and take advantage of their sea horses' ability to move vertically as well as forward and back and from side to side.",
					"All sea horses have 120-foot darkvision and acute senses; it is a foolish rider who fails to take notice of his sea horse mount's warnings.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"In their natural environment, sea horses congregate in schools, feeding off small plankton and seaweed. They have school leaders and follow the prevailing currents. They are generally shy and avoid contact except with other sea horses.",
					"Sea horses can be found in any marine setting except the coldest arctic depths. They prefer tropical to subtropical depths as these provide the greatest variety of foods.",
					"Sea horses are not the brightest of beasts and can be lured into traps and cages if the bait is attractive enough. Aquatic elves and locathah have honed the activity of capturing sea horses to a fine art and acquire all the sea horses they need.",
					"生态学",
					"Sea horses are preyed upon by the usual assortment of ocean-based predators, namely sharks, giant squids, and krakens. They only have one special predator, the vicious sahuagin. Unfortunately for sea horses, sahuagin will eat anything at least once and they found that giant sea horses were indeed a great delicacy. A small and profitable industry in every sahuagin city is the market guild, and the greatest commodity is sea horse flesh. Many noble houses specialize in hunting down and herding up these peaceful creatures. Sahuagin choose not to cultivate sea horses as they believe the open ocean makes the horses tougher and tastier.",
					"Fortunately for the species, sea horses mate all the time and like most fish they grow very rapidly. There is little chance of sending the sea horse population to extinction. For now at least, they remain one of the larger members of the food chain and valued for defense and prestige in both the locathah and aquatic elven communities.",
					"Rumors of a smaller, freshwater species of giant sea horse remain unconfirmed and the tales of gargantuan sea horses over 60 feet in length have been decisively discounted by most reputable marine authorities. However, only the races that live below the sea can say for certain what mysteries yet remain to someday be discovered by men."

They are able to directly metabolize the heat of their surroundings, and they use this to fuel their own bodily functions. Without this extra heat, the giant strider grows chilled and sluggish.",
					"Their physiology is so modified that normal conditions are dangerous to them. They are poisoned by ingested water and harmed by cold weather or frigid attacks.",
					"Despite their abnormal natue, giant striders' behavior is similar to that of other flightless birds. Mating season occurs in the spring. Cocks compete for mates by elaborate dances punctuated by the explosions of fireballs. The hens lay {@dice 1d4} eggs in a simple nest, usually a pit scratched in the ground. The chicks hatch in five to six weeks and stand about 6 inches high. They grow swiftly, adding 6 inches per month. They can begin to emit flame after six months. Giant striders mature in one year.",
					"Giant striders are the primary mounts of firenewts. A firenewt tribe might keep a herd of up to 100 giant striders. Giant striders are fitted with a saddle atop the hips. The firenewts control these mounts by kicking their sides or hitting them with spears (the giant striders' sharp teeth would saw through any bridle).",

					"Wild striders have a potential lifespan of 10 to 20 years, although the struggle for survival usually shortens this. Striders domesticated by firenewts are usually killed and eaten after 15 years."

					"Giant weasels are giant-sized versions of this species that, although similar in many respects to normal weasels, are much more vicious and aggressive. Perhaps the most obvious difference is their tendency to live and hunt in packs. They attack men as often as any other prey and are relentless adversaries.",
					"When a giant weasel bites, it locks its jaws onto its victim and refuses to let go. Instead, the weasel begins to suck the blood from its prey. Agents in the animal's saliva not only prevent the victim's blood from clotting, but actually promote the bleeding of the wound. The resulting blood loss is so rapid that it causes {@dice 1d4} points of damage per round. After the initial hit is scored, further rolls to inflict damage are not required.",
					"When the lair of a pack of giant weasels is found, it often contains a minimum of four animals. There are young equal to the number of adults in the lair; the young are from 10% to 80% grown. They attack just as the adults would, inflicting damage appropriate to their degree of growth. If taken before they are half-grown, there is a chance that giant weasels can be trained to serve as hunting or guard animals.",
					"The pelts of giant weasels are valuable, as are those of their smaller cousins, and an intact one can fetch from 1,000 to 6,000 gold pieces on the open market. As a general rule, the most valuable pelts are those of the northern species, which are wholly white in color, or those of the rare black weasels."

					"The giff are a race of powerfully muscled mercenaries. They are civilized, though they lack mages among their own race. Giff hire on with various groups throughout the universe as mercenaries, bodyguards, enforcers, and general legbreakers.",
					"The giff is humanoid, with stocky, flat, cylindrical legs and a humanoid torso, arms, and fingers. Its chest is broad and supports a hippopotamus head with a natural helmet of flexible, chitinous plates. Giff come in colors ranging from black to gray to a rich gold, and many have colorful tattoos that leave their bodies a patchwork record of past victories. Giff speak their own language and the Common tongue.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The giff are happiest among their own race they consider larger races such as giants threatening and complain about the fragility of the smaller races. Unlike the dracons, they suffer no penalties for being apart from their fellows, but merely prefer the company of their own species. Outside their own platoons, the giff are happiest among military organizations with a strong chain of command.",
					"Every giff, male, female, and giffling, has a rank within society, which can only be changed by someone of higher rank. Within this rank are subranks and within those subranks are color markings and badges. The highest-ranking giff gives the orders, the others obey. It does not matter if the orders are foolish or even suicidal following them is the purpose of the giff in the universe. A quasi-mystical faith among the giff mercenaries confirm that all things have their place, and the giff's is to follow orders. This makes the giff very happy.",
					"Giff platoons can be hired by those looking for their muscle. The arcane do a small business in giff mercenaries, but usually local contractors perform the task. These contractors review prospective employers according to ability to pay, then make a recommendation to the giff leaders. The leaders, in turn, consider the danger of the job, and whether taking it will enhance their giffdom.",
					"Giff jobs are usually paid in smoke powder, though they often will accept other weapons and armor. It is purely a barter system, but to hire one giff for one standard week requires seven charges of smoke powder (one/day). In areas where smoke powder is more common, the price will rise.",
					"On board ship, the giff have their own quarters, and will often request to bring on their own large weapons. They favor greek fire projectors and bombards for ground work, and will happily blaze away at opponents, regardless of the tactical situation.",
					"The giff require the ships of others because they have no spellcasting abilities among them they are magically inert in such a way that even the serial helms of the mind flayers have no effect on them. Lifejammers are considered to be a \"wizard's way to die\" (a giff insult). Giff trade their services for transport and for weapons especially smoke powder.",
					"Giff of both sexes serve in their platoons, and both fight equally well. Gill young are raised tenderly until they are old enough to survive an exploding arquebus, then are inducted fully into the platoon.",
					"Giff are fierce fighters, despite their somewhat comical appearance and mania for weapons. They will not, however, willingly fight other giff. If forced into such a situation on a battlefield, both groups will retire for at least a day of drinking and sorting out ranks. There is a 10% chance that one platoon will join another in this case, but most likely both will quit their current hirings and look for work elsewhere.",
					"生态学",
					"Like the dracon, the giff are surmises to have evolved from one world, which was not blessed with a wide variety of intelligent species such as elves, men, dwarves, and beholders. Sages point to the giff as an example of what happens when only one sentient species is found on a planet.",
					"The giff homeworld is the stuff of legend; as no living giff has seen it. Some tales say that the homeworld was destroyed by the giff, who were rescued by the arcane. Others say that the giff sold their planet and their lives to the arcane in exchange for spelljamming helms they could not use. Still others say that the giff homeworld is just beyond the range of one's ship, in a land where such warrior races are common, and the losers are exiled to the known worlds.",
					"Whatever the truth, the giff describe their homeworld in legendary terms a thick, verdant jungle, covered with swamps, mangrove trees, and fruit plants. The few mountains are rich in metals, caches of weapons. and smoke powder.",
					"The giff practice equality among the sexes in battle and in childrearing. They live about 70 years, but do not take aging gracefully. As a giff grows older and begins to slow down, he is possessed with the idea of proving himself still young and vital, usually in battle. As a result, there are very, very few old giff."

					"Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the githzerai.",
					"Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, beads, and precious metals and gems.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"History provides some information on the githyanki their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward them. For centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).",
					"These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has progressed beyond the 11th level of experience and very few progress beyond 9th. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obviously results in death. Githyanki that reach 12th level of experience are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess.",
					"Githyanki dwell in huge castles on the Astral plane. These ornately decorated castles are avoided by all other dwellers on the Astral plane for the githyanki are infamous for being inhospitable to strangers.",
					"A githyanki stronghold will be ruled by a supreme leader. This leader will be a fighter or mage of 10th. The supreme leader is the undisputed overlord of the castle with the power of life and death over all who dwell there. A typical leader will be equipped with 2d4 random magical items in addition to the weapons described above.",
					"All castles have a retinue of 20-80 knights of 9th level that serve as the supreme leader's elite shock troops. They are fanatically loyal. There will also be up to 1,000 githyanki of lesser status.",
					"Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel to the Prime Material plane. These treks across the planes often lead to the formation of underground lairs used to mount surface raids, though their hatred is more often directed against mind flayers. Outside the war with the githzerai, these raids are conducted largely for the perverse pleasure of the kill.",
					"A typical githyanki lair on the Prime Material plane will contain the following:",
					"One supreme leader 11th-level fighter or 7th mage",
					"Two captains 8th-level fighter and 7th mage",
					"One knight 8th level",
					"Two warlocks mages of 7th level",
					"Three sergeants fighters of 7th level",
					"Two 'gish' fighter/mages of 4th/4th level",
					"20-50 lower levels determined randomly using the table above, of 1st-3rd level",
					"On the Prime Material plane, githyanki have a pact with a group of red dragons. These proud creatures will act as mounts and companions to the githyanki. When encountered on the Prime Material plane and outside their lair, a githyanki group will typically consist of the following:",
					"One captain 8th-level fighter",
					"One warlock 7th-level mage",
					"Five lower githyankis fighters of 1st-3rd level",
					"Such a group will have two red dragons as steeds, transporting between four and six githyanki per dragon. The dragons will fight for the safety and well-being of the githyanki but will not directly risk their lives, fleeing when the battle is turned against them. Just what the githyanki offer the red dragons in return for these services is unknown.",
					"An interesting aspect of githyanki society is the apparent bond between military leaders and their subordinates. This bond allows a leader to give his men short, almost senseless commands (to human standards) and actually relay complex and exacting messages. Although this has no actual affect during the melee round, it often leads to more effective ambushes and attacks and allows complex military decisions to be relayed quickly.",
					"生态学",
					"Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of environments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups are much different. In a society where farmers and tradesmen are unnecessary, more unique, specialized groups have evolved.",
					"G''lathk: The g''lathk, (admittedly nearly unpronounceable in human tongues) are the equivalent of farmers. Due to the barrenness of the Astral plane, the githyanki are forced to grow food in vast, artificial chambers. They rely upon a variety of fungi and other plants that require no sunlight to grow. The g''lathk are also experts in aquatic plantlife, sometimes tending gigantic water-gardens.",
					"Mlar: Not all magic-using githyanki ever attain the power and self-discipline necessary to become wizards. Some use their magical talents in the field of architecture and construction. The mlar are such individuals, focusing their creative energies toward designing and constructing the buildings and structures used in day-to-day life in githyanki society. The mlar have developed their jobs into an art form.",
					"Hr'a'cknir: The Astral plane has many strange energies moving through it. Some of these energies are obvious to the senses, such as heat and light. Others are not so easily observed. There are many psychic and strange astral energies that humans generally are not aware of. Being a psychically aware race, however, the githyanki cannot only sense these energies, but harness them too. The hr'a'cknir are the collectors of those energies. They are similar to the mlar, in that they use innate magical powers to perform their crafts.",
					"More than humans, githyanki are hunters and predators. They will typically engage in raiding and plundering seemingly for the joy they derive from it. It is likely that the long centuries of enslavement of their race has caused the githyanki to bully those weaker than themselves.",
					"Unlike humans, though, the githyanki never war amongst themselves. The split of the githyanki and the githzerai is the closest thing the gith races have known to civil war. Githyanki never battles githyanki. It is the unwritten rule of gith society and is never broken. This, too, may be an effect of the race's enslavement."

					"描述",
					"Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the githzerai.",
					"Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, beads, and precious metals and gems.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"History provides some information on the githyanki their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward them. For centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).",
					"These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has progressed beyond the 11th level of experience and very few progress beyond 9th. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obviously results in death. Githyanki that reach 12th level of experience are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess.",
					"Githyanki dwell in huge castles on the Astral plane. These ornately decorated castles are avoided by all other dwellers on the Astral plane for the githyanki are infamous for being inhospitable to strangers.",
					"A githyanki stronghold will be ruled by a supreme leader. This leader will be a fighter or mage of 10th. The supreme leader is the undisputed overlord of the castle with the power of life and death over all who dwell there. A typical leader will be equipped with 2d4 random magical items in addition to the weapons described above.",
					"All castles have a retinue of 20-80 knights of 9th level that serve as the supreme leader's elite shock troops. They are fanatically loyal. There will also be up to 1,000 githyanki of lesser status.",
					"Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel to the Prime Material plane. These treks across the planes often lead to the formation of underground lairs used to mount surface raids, though their hatred is more often directed against mind flayers. Outside the war with the githzerai, these raids are conducted largely for the perverse pleasure of the kill.",
					"A typical githyanki lair on the Prime Material plane will contain the following:",
					"One supreme leader 11th-level fighter or 7th mage",
					"Two captains 8th-level fighter and 7th mage",
					"One knight 8th level",
					"Two warlocks mages of 7th level",
					"Three sergeants fighters of 7th level",
					"Two 'gish' fighter/mages of 4th/4th level",
					"20-50 lower levels determined randomly using the table above, of 1st-3rd level",
					"On the Prime Material plane, githyanki have a pact with a group of red dragons. These proud creatures will act as mounts and companions to the githyanki. When encountered on the Prime Material plane and outside their lair, a githyanki group will typically consist of the following:",
					"One captain 8th-level fighter",
					"One warlock 7th-level mage",
					"Five lower githyankis fighters of 1st-3rd level",

					"描述",
					"Githzerai are very similar in appearance to their githyanki cousins, although they tend to look much more human. Their features are for the most part unremarkable, with vaguely noble countenance. Their skin tone is that of human caucasian flesh. Githzerai dress simply, wearing functional clothing and favoring conservative tones.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The githzerai were originally offspring of a race of humans that were freed from slavery under mind flayers by a great female warrior named Gith. These men and women did not, however, choose to follow Gith's ways after they revolted against their slavers. Instead, they fell sway to the teachings of a powerful wizard who proclaimed himself king and later, god of the people. The githzerai then separated themselves from the githyanki, beginning a great racial war that has endured the long millennia without diminishing.",
					"The githzerai, who worship a powerful and ancient wizard as though he were a god (he is not), are destroyed before they have enough power to become a threat to their ruler.",
					"If encountered outside of their lair, githzerai will usually be in the following numbers:",
					"One supreme leader 9th-level fighter or 7th-level mage",
					"One captain 6th-level fighter or 4th-level mage",
					"Two warlocks mages of 5th level",
					"Three sergeants fighters of 5th level",
					"Three 'zerths' fighter/mages of 3rd/3rd level",
					"1d4+1 x 10 lesser githzerai evenly distributed between the three possible classes and of 1st to 3rd level",
					"A thief, if present (10% chance), will replace one of the lower level githzerai and will be of 10th level.",
					"The githzerai dwell primarily on the plane of Limbo. They have mighty fortresses in that plane of chaos and their position there is very strong. Typically, one of these fortresses contains approximately 3,000 githzerai led by a single supreme leader. This leader has absolute control over the githzerai, including the powers of life and death.",
					"The githzerai hold only a few fortresses on the Prime Material plane, but these are particularly strong holdings, with walls of adamantite rising as huge squat towers from dusty plains. Each houses approximately 500 githzerai, including a supreme leader.",
					"On Limbo, however, the githzerai presence is very strong. Living in cities typically of 100,000 or more, the githzerai enjoy total power over themselves on an otherwise chaotic and unpredictable plane. One notable example of this is the city Shra'kt'lor. This large githzerai capital is composed of some 2,000,000 githzerai living in great power. Shra'kt'lor serves as both a capital and as a headquarters for all githzerai military matters.

					"描述",
					"Githzerai are very similar in appearance to their githyanki cousins, although they tend to look much more human. Their features are for the most part unremarkable, with vaguely noble countenance. Their skin tone is that of human caucasian flesh. Githzerai dress simply, wearing functional clothing and favoring conservative tones.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"The githzerai were originally offspring of a race of humans that were freed from slavery under mind flayers by a great female warrior named Gith. These men and women did not, however, choose to follow Gith's ways after they revolted against their slavers. Instead, they fell sway to the teachings of a powerful wizard who proclaimed himself king and later, god of the people. The githzerai then separated themselves from the githyanki, beginning a great racial war that has endured the long millennia without diminishing.",
					"The githzerai, who worship a powerful and ancient wizard as though he were a god (he is not), are destroyed before they have enough power to become a threat to their ruler.",
					"If encountered outside of their lair, githzerai will usually be in the following numbers:",
					"One supreme leader 9th-level fighter or 7th-level mage",
					"One captain 6th-level fighter or 4th-level mage",
					"Two warlocks mages of 5th level",
					"Three sergeants fighters of 5th level",
					"Three 'zerths' fighter/mages of 3rd/3rd level",
					"1d4+1 x 10 lesser githzerai evenly distributed between the three possible classes and of 1st to 3rd level",
					"A thief, if present (10% chance), will replace one of the lower level githzerai and will be of 10th level.",
					"The githzerai dwell primarily on the plane of Limbo. They have mighty fortresses in that plane of chaos and their position there is very strong. Typically, one of these fortresses contains approximately 3,000 githzerai led by a single supreme leader. This leader has absolute control over the githzerai, including the powers of life and death.",
					"The githzerai hold only a few fortresses on the Prime Material plane, but these are particularly strong holdings, with walls of adamantite rising as huge squat towers from dusty plains. Each houses approximately 500 githzerai, including a supreme leader.",
					"On Limbo, however, the githzerai presence is very strong. Living in cities typically of 100,000 or more, the githzerai enjoy total power over themselves on an otherwise chaotic and unpredictable plane. One notable example of this is the city Shra'kt'lor. This large githzerai capital is composed of some 2,000,000 githzerai living in great power. Shra'kt'lor serves as both a capital and as a headquarters for all githzerai military matters. The greatest generals and nobles of the race meet here to plan githzerai strategy for battling both the githyanki and the mind flayers. There is likely no force on Limbo that could readily threaten the power of Shra'kt'lor or its many inhabitants.",

					"描述",
					"Gorgons are fierce, bull-like beasts who make their lairs in dreary caverns or the fastness of a wilderness. They are aggressive by nature and usually attack any creature or person they encounter.",
					"Monstrous black bulls, gorgons have hides of thick metal scales. Their breath is a noxious vapor that billows forth in great puffs from their wide, bull nostrils. Gorgons walk on two hooves, when necessary, but usually assume a four-hoofed stance. Despite their great size, they can move through even heavy forests with incredible speed, for they simply trample bushes and splinter smaller trees. Gorgons speak no languages but let out a roar of anger whenever they encounter other beings.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"It is believed that gorgons can actually devour the living statues they create with their breath weapon. Whether their flat iron teeth break up and pulverize the stone or their saliva returns the victim to flesh while they eat is a matter for conjecture.",
					"Their primary prey are deer and elk, but gorgons won't hesitate to add other meats to their diet when hungry. Their sense of smell is acute and once they get on the trail gorgons are 75% likely to track their victim successfully. Once their victim is in sight, gorgons let out a scream of rage and then charge. Unless somehow evaded, a gorgon will pursue tirelessly, for days if necessary, until the prey either drops from exhaustion or is caught in the gorgon's deadly breath.",
					"Gorgons have no use for treasure, hence gold and gems are often left petrified on the statue of the being that once wore them. Occasionally a gorgon in his haste will devour something of value; the items will later be left in the gorgon's droppings, somewhere near the entrance to its lair.",
					"Gorgons are usually encountered in groups of three or four one male bull with two or three females. Gorgon calves are raised by the females to the age of two, then the young bulls are turned out to make their own way. Females remain with the dominant bull.",
					"About 25% of the time only a single gorgon is encountered. Lone gorgons are always rogue males in search of females.",
					"The forest around a gorgon lair is usually a crisscrossing network of trails and paths they've made. Occasionally there are clearings where the grasses were trampled down in a battle and perhaps the shattered remains of a statue can be found.",
					"生态学",
					"Gorgons have no natural enemies other than themselves. Bull gorgons are often called upon to defend their positions against rogue gorgons. These battles are not usually fatal, but even a gorgon can be felled by a well-aimed horn gore. The only other creature known to hunt these fierce predators is man.",
					"Gorgon blood, properly prepared, can seal an area against ethereal or astral intrusion; their powdered scales are an ingredient in the ink used to create a {@spell Protection from Poison|PHB|protection from petrification} scroll.",
					"In addition, the hide of a gorgon can be fashioned, with considerable work and some magical enhancement, into a fine set of scale mail. This armor will provide the wearer with a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. petrification or flesh-to-stone spells."

					"描述",
					"Collectively known as goristroi, these huge tanar'ri can be found on nearly any plane of the Abyss, for they are adaptable and much desired by the rulers of the place to serve as engines of destruction.",
					"Abyssal lords and powers are able to command the goristroi and keep them serving as guardians, enforcers, siege engines, and so on. The hulking goristroi are too stupid and bestial to do more than carry out their orders, and thus their status never reaches that or the true tanar'ri.",
					"Gorislroi are vaguely reminiscent of giant bears, although their shoulder are broader, their visages a nightmarish cross between bison and human, and their hands and feet disproportionately large, splayed, and humanlike.",
					"Their arms are extremely long, like an ape's. Individual colors vary from dark brown through sickly greenish yellow to a peculiar purplish gray.",
					"From the third volume of \"Deception And Strategems\", by the pit fiend Mellagorus:",
					"Though the lumbering goristroi are excellent at climbing sheer stone faces and though these assaults can break our fortications, such strategies also present us with an opportunity to destroy the beasts.",
					"Their powerful clawed fingers can make handholds in sheer stone, but their enormous size makes them vulnerable to falls, and they suffer twice the damage a smaller creature might from a fall.",
					"The goristroi are especially afraid of Bigby's forceful hand, dig, fly, levitation, and other spells that can push them off the heights to be broken on the rocks below or, even more amusingly, onto the weapons of their fellow tanar'ri.",
					"Weak-minded goristroi are also vulnerable to spells such as cause fear, fear, symbol of fear, and repulsion, which drive them off walls.",
					"For all these reasons, arcanaloth are the best countermeasures to employ against goristroi assaults on an entrenched position on the height.",
					"Fools though they are, tanar'ri commanders rarely order a goristro over the walls unless the situation is desperate or a diversionary attack has drawn off most of the defenders.",
					"Take this as a sign of weakness and counterattack.",
					"Usually solitary, goristroi are only important among their kin because of their ability to absorb damage and to mete it out.",
					"They are stupid and otherwise limited in power, unable even to gate in other tanar'ri. The vast majority of goristroi encountered are in the service of some Abyssal ruler, blindly carrying out the duties assigned to them with complete fanaticism.",
					"There is never a question of retreat or morale when dealing with these brutes, though the threat of long falls can induce paralysis on the field of action. In all other respects, they always continue to follow their given commands until completion or death occurs.",
					"In the Blood War the goristroi serve as siege engines and rallying points for lesser tanar'ri, much as elephants do among some prime-material worlds.",
					"A goristroi citadel is a platform strapped to the creature's head and shoulders like a helmet. The tanar'ri carries this citadel as a lesser creature might carry a knapsack; it hardly seems aware of it.",
					"Again from Mellagorus' \"Deception And Strategems\"",
					"Goristroi citadels are dangerous and best kept busy with cannon fodder and inferior troops, but if they can be broken the lesser troops surrounding them are usually routed. The best way to accomplish this is to harry a goristro from two directions.",
					"The retarded behemoth will turn from one attack to the other, unconscious of the fact that its rapid movements are shaking and battering the creatures within the citadel to death. At this point flying troops such as abishai can take the citadel and slay the goristro by a surgical strike to the neck with axes, polearms, and cleavers.",
					"Goristroi ruled by an Abyssal lord or power always wear some symbol of servitude, such as a collar, an arm or wrist band, or an implanted symbol. Such devices zypically have the power to conves telepathic commands to the wearer as well as serve as tracking devices should the masters wish to know the whereabouts of their servants.",
					"Without direct command or supervision, goristroi tend to wander off on destructive rampages of their own direction and desire.",
					"Goristroi do not breed naturally. They are carefully mated by their owners after extensive negotiations, eventually resulting in a single young. The goristroi are carefully watched throughout the entire process, for fear of foul play by the other side, such as an attempt to slay these valuable beasts.",
					"Generally, the terms are that the owner of the male goristroi gains the female young, and the owner of the mother is entitled to the male young produced. The young grow to maturity within five voracious, screaming years.",
					"This allows the lucky owner to breed further young on his own, albeit inbred ones. However, abductions, infanticide (if the young is the wrong gender), and even outright purchases of the live young are fairy common. Under no circumstances are the parents allowed to have any influence on the young goristro.",
					"生态学",
					"Goristroi are predators that make no distinction between various types of prey. They eat anything that moves, even among their own kind, devouring lesser tanar'ri when their dim minds believe no one is watching.",
					"They are exclusively carnivorous, unable to eat vegetable matter even if no other food is available. If forced to go without living or recently slain meat, goristroi wither and die within two weeks, so tanar'ri commanders usually sacrifice lesser troops for the sake of keeping their citadels going.",
					"Goristroi flesh is itself poisonous if ingested, so not even powerful planar creatures or pack hunters like trolls and armanites attack them."

					"A hatchling green dragon's scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and become lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings. A green dragon's scales never become as thick as other dragons', remaining smooth and flexible.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Green dragons are found in sub-tropical and temperate forests, the older the forest and bigger the trees, the better. The sights and smells of the woods are pleasing to the dragon, and it considers the entire forest or woods its territory. Sometimes the dragon will enter into a relationship with other evil forest-dwelling creatures, which keep the dragon informed about what is going on in the forest and surrounding area in exchange for their lives. If a green dragon lives in a forest on a hillside, it will seek to enslave hill giants, which the dragon considers its greatest enemy. A green dragon makes its lair in underground chambers far beneath its forest.",
					"The majority of green dragons encountered will be alone. However, when a mated pair of dragons and their young are encountered, the female will leap to the attack. The male will take the young to a place of safety before joining the fight. The parents are extremely protective of their young, despite their evil nature, and will sacrifice their own lives to save their offspring.",
					"生态学",
					"Although green dragons have been known to eat practically anything, including shrubs and small trees when they are hungry enough, they especially prize elves. If the forest is on a hillside, hill giants will hunt the younger dragons, which they consider a delicacy."

					"描述",
					"Half-lion, half-eagle, griffons are ferocious avian carnivores that prey upon horses and their kin (hippogriffs, pegasi, and unicorns). This hunger for horseflesh often brings griffons into direct conflict with humans and demihumans. Adult griffons stand five feet at the shoulder and weigh over half a ton. Their head, upper torso, and forelegs are like those of a giant eagle.",
					"This eagle half is covered in golden feathers from its wing tips to its razor-sharp beak. Their powerful forelimbs end in long, hooked talons. Wings, with a span of 25 feet or more, rise out of their backs. The lower half of a griffon is that of a lion. Dusky yellow fur covers the lion half's muscular rear legs and clawed feet.",
					"A lion's tail hangs down from the griffon's powerful rear haunches. Griffons speak no languages, but emit an eagle-like screech when angered or excited (usually by the smell of horse).",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Griffons prefer rocky habitats, near open plains. Once griffons establish their territory, they remain until the food supply has been exhausted. Griffons, like lions, live in prides, with each pride comprising several mated pairs, their young, and one dominant male.",
					"The dominant male is responsible for settling territorial disputes with other prides and choosing the direction the hunt will take. Each pair of mated griffons in the pride has its own nest, located near the pride's other lairs. Griffon nests are usually situated in shallow caves, high along a cliff face.",
					"The nests are made of sticks and leaves, as well as an occasional bone. Griffons collect no treasure, but their caves frequently contain the remains of unfortunate travelers who tried to protect their horses from the griffons. During spring, female griffons lay one or two eggs that hatch in the late summer.",
					"For the first three months griffon young are known as hatchlings; thereafter, until they mature the young are called fledglings. Griffon young grow rapidly for three years until they are large enough to hunt with the pride. Adult griffons are extremely protective of their young and attack without mercy any creature that approaches within 100 feet of the nest.",
					"生态学",
					"If trained from a very early age (three years or less), griffons will serve as mounts. The training, however, is both time-consuming and expensive, requiring the expertise of an animal trainer for two years.",
					"Once trained, though, griffons make fierce and loyal steeds, bonding with one master for life, and protecting him even unto death. A griffon mount knows no fear in battle, but attacks any horse or horse-kin in preference to other opponents.",
					"Acquiring a griffon fledgling is a very dangerous venture as the adults never stray far from the nest and fight to the death to defend eggs or young. Any given griffon nest is 75% likely to contain one or two fledglings or eggs. Fledgling griffons sell for 5,000 gold pieces on the open market; eggs sell for 2,000 gold pieces each.",
					"Griffon is employed as component to empower the following spells: {@spell Feather Fall}"

					"Grimlocks will nearly always attack in darkness if possible. While not adversely affected by light, they are intelligent enough to realize that in total darkness, their unique form of perception gives them a distinct advantage.",

Grimlock leaders and champions do wield some control over these communities. However, this control is usually effective only as long as the leader who gave the order is around to enforce his will.",
					"It is nearly impossible for those of other races to tell one grimlock from another although leader types may appear slightly larger but they easily tell each other apart by subtle differences in scent and movement.",
					"Extremely xenophobic, grimlocks rarely consort with other races. However, there is a small (10%) chance that they will allow medusae to share their lairs, and a 2% chance that any wandering group will be accompanied by 1-2 mind flayers.",
					"生态学",
					"Grimlocks will only eat the raw flesh of humanoid creatures, vastly preferring that of humans to all others. Foraging parties often raid the homes of other subterranean races, especially those who keep large slave populations (such as drow). They are often on good terms with mind flayers since illithids have a large supply of humanoid bodies discarded after they have devoured the brains. Grimlocks are particularly hated by githyanki for this reason. Since the slave flesh the grimlocks often consume (raw) is frequently unwholesome, whole communities are often decimated by disease.",

Their upper bodies, however, are more developed, with muscular forelimbs, opposable thumbs, and smaller, more humanoid looking heads. They stand upright and move in rapid, short hops. They are incapable of the prodigious leaps and jumps of frogs, toads, or bullywugs.",

In its place, the grung's wide mouths are full of the sharp teeth needed by carnivores Grung have the slick, wet skin of other amphibians. Since they breathe through their skin, they must keep it moist. Their coloration is like that of bullfrogs dappled green and brown on their backs, shading to white or yellow on their bellies. Their eyes smaller than those of frogs and toads and protected by bony ridges are red with black pupils. Males are slightly smaller than females.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Grung are war-like, territorial creatures. They typically claim all territory within at least a mile of their tribal settlements. Anyone unwise enough to enter this territory is a target for immediate attack. Grung from other tribes are also fair game; nasty little border wars between neighboring tribes are the rule, not the exception. Most encounters with grung are with wandering war bands looking for trespassers. Grung are always hostile and cannot be negotiated with.",
					"Grung settlements are untidy collections of crude shelters, sometimes concealed inside large dead trees. tribes number 10d6+40 individuals, with young comprising 25% of that number (AC 10, Sw 12, HD ½, #AT 1, Dmg 1 [no poison], SA nil). Grung lay eggs, and their offspring go through a tadpole stage. For this reason, grung settlements are always next to open water. Within three months of hatching, the tadpoles absorb their tails, develop limbs, and climb out of the water and join the tribe as immature grung. These young grungs have 1-1 Hit Dice but otherwise have the same abilities as adults. They reach full maturity in another six months.",
					"Grung tribes are matriarchal. War chiefs are all female, and the tribal chieftain is the strongest fighter among the war chiefs. Rising through the ranks is by duels to the death, with the victor getting the title. Each tribe also has a single female shaman of up to 3rd level. Her spheres are All, Animal, Combat, Healing (reversed spells only), and Plant.",

Any non-grung drinking the water must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison (with a +3 bonus) or become nauseated for 2d4 rounds. Nauseated creatures fight with penalties of -1 to their attack rolls and +1 to their Armor Class.",

					"描述",
					"Grung are highly territorial, toad-like humanoids that dwell in swamps and marshes.",
					"Standing about three feet tall, grung have lower bodies that strongly resemble those of giant frogs or toads, with powerful legs and large webbed feet. Their upper bodies, however, are more developed, with muscular forelimbs, opposable thumbs, and smaller, more humanoid looking heads. They stand upright and move in rapid, short hops. They are incapable of the prodigious leaps and jumps of frogs, toads, or {@creature bullywug|AGGMM}s.",
					"While evolution has given them intelligence and forelimbs capable of using tools, it has taken away the prehensile tongues of frogs. In its place, the grung's wide mouths are full of the sharp teeth needed by carnivores Grung have the slick, wet skin of other amphibians. Since they breathe through their skin, they must keep it moist. Their coloration is like that of {@creature bullfrog|AGGMM}s dappled green and brown on their backs, shading to white or yellow on their bellies. Their eyes smaller than those of frogs and toads and protected by bony ridges are red with black pupils. Males are slightly smaller than females.",
					"人居环境/社会",
					"Grung are war-like, territorial creatures. They typically claim all territory within at least a mile of their tribal settlements. Anyone unwise enough to enter this territory is a target for immediate attack. Grung from other tribes are also fair game; nasty little border wars between neighboring tribes are the rule, not the exception. Most encounters with grung are with wandering war bands looking for trespassers. Grung are always hostile and cannot be negotiated with.",
					"Grung settlements are untidy collections of crude shelters, sometimes concealed inside large dead trees. tribes number 10d6+40 individuals, with young comprising 25% of that number (AC 10, Sw 12, HD ½, #AT 1, Dmg 1 [no poison], SA nil). Grung lay eggs, and their offspring go through a tadpole stage. For this reason, grung settlements are always next to open water. Within three months of hatching, the tadpoles absorb their tails, develop limbs, and climb out of the water and join the tribe as immature grung. These young grungs have 1-1 Hit Dice but otherwise have the same abilities as adults. They reach full maturity in another six months.",
					"Grung tribes are matriarchal. War chiefs are all female, and the tribal chieftain is the strongest fighter among the war chiefs. Rising through the ranks is by duels to the death, with the victor getting the title. Each tribe also has a single female shaman of up to 3rd level. Her spheres are All, Animal, Combat, Healing (reversed spells only), and Plant.",
					"生态学",
					"Grung eat swamp-dwelling mammals, such as rats, unwary travelers, even other grung. They have few natural predators due to the toxicity of their flesh. Giant poisonous snakes are usually immune to grung poison and actively hunt grung.",
					"The water around grung settlements is tainted by their poisonous secretions. Any non-grung drinking the water must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison (with a +3 bonus) or become nauseated for 2d4 rounds. Nauseated creatures fight with penalties of -1 to their attack rolls and +1 to their Armor Class.",
					"Grung poison is almost impossible to bottle (as any exposure to air causes it to decompose in ten rounds)."

Using their many spells to learn as much as possible about the setting, they then wait for the next group of travelers, pilgrims, or adventurers to come by and hope that they've encountered an androsphinx in their travels or have spells or magical items that might be usable for just such a purpose.",

A gynosphinx mated with a criosphinx only produces another male criosphinx, while mating with a hieracosphinx produces similarly displeasing results.",

Unfortunately, they are among the slowest of the sphinxes when flying or running, and the lustful criosphinx and vicious hieracosphinx rarely give up the chase once a gynosphinx has been located."
