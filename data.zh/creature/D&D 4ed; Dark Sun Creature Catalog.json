					"大多数生物认为伏地魔是智力有限的致命龙人猎手。然而，他们在自己的同类中是社会性的生物。埋伏德拉克与经典的龙族心态一样，喜欢囤积财宝，但一个群体不相信个人所有权。虽然一只埋伏的龙在任何时候都可能使用一件物品，但这个群体拥有宝物，明天另一只埋伏的龙可能会使用它。",
					"埋伏的公鸭喜欢用四肢移动，利用地形做掩护，直到它们足够接近猎物时才冲上去。一只伏击龙通常重达200磅，有一个5英尺长的身体。它的鳞片呈现出红色或棕色的暗色调，使它能够在阿萨斯的山区或岩石坏境中不被发现。伏击龙生活在岩石地区，喜欢在夜晚最冷的时候躲在山洞里。它们通常在白天狩猎，日出时离开，日落时返回巢穴。",
					"伏地魔可以说普通话和Draconic语，但很少选择这样做。相反，它们会用心灵感应与它们的同类进行交流。埋伏德拉克共享一种公共意识，使它们能够与其他埋伏德拉克进行心灵感应。",
					"邂逅",
					"伏击龙一般是作为一个协调的群体跟踪它们的猎物。它们一开始就使用它们的呼吸武器，集中攻击受影响的生物，无视快速逃窜的猎物。"

					"在移动过程中，阿纳科人以根为生，包括帮助生产阿纳科麻痹剂的有毒标本。最近Anakore移动的一个明显标志是一个充满了倒下的无根植物的区域。偶尔，一个特别狡猾的沙丘之王会把这些叶子处理掉，以免泄露族群的存在，但这种程度的狡猾是罕见的。关于Anakores的起源，人们知之甚少。根据一个古老的传说，来自天外的恐怖触动了作为这些生物祖先的人形动物。之后，这些祖先从灼热的太阳中退缩，钻入荒野之下，寻找凉爽、包容的黑暗。在沙子下面，这些生物做着黑暗的梦，成为沙漠的噩梦。没有明显的特征来区分Anakores是男是女。据传，这些生物不生孩子，而是把选定的受害者拖到沙子下面的奇怪空地上。在这些子宫里，被俘虏的人成为新的Anakores而不是食物。Anakores如何以及为什么选择特定的人作为他们的新亲属，尚不清楚。",
					"邂逅",
					"Anakores避免在它们无法钻入的地形上作战。它们与其他同类或其他穴居生物一起出现，如bulettes、hejkins、galeb duhrs和kruthiks。荒原突袭者通过向这些生物支付食物和闪亮的饰物来说服一群Anakores为他们工作。梦境和幻觉也诱使阿纳科里人去探索其他反常生物居住的古代遗迹，其中一些甚至比沙丘之王更强大和更聪明。在这些地方，Anakores为这些生物服务，并加入他们难以理解的仪式。Anakores在上升到攻击之前，先在猎物下面钻洞。猎人出现，抓住目标，并使用拖拽来减少他们必须面对的敌人的数量。撕裂者从沙地上冲出来，留在猎物的上方，将目标压低，使其更容易受到联盟的攻击。沙丘之王以沙子喷发的方式投入战斗，用它的毒爪来阻止猎物逃跑。当陷入糟糕的战术局面时，沙丘王会逃跑或与敌人和平相处（但很勉强）。",

					"布罗格人是简单的巨人，有着古老的方式。当他们以小队形式游荡或居住在悬崖或峡谷间的隐蔽住所时，他们会聆听原始精神和世界元素的低语。除了寻找食物和水，他们很少使用这些实体赋予的原始魔法。相反，布罗格人过着温和的生活，只从土地上获取他们需要的东西，偶尔与其他布罗格人会面，进行交配和交换故事。尽管智力低下，典型的布罗格人是一个有能力的生存者，并且天生具有战斗天赋。",
					"一个专注于战斗艺术的布洛克，就像自由布洛克中的精英猎手那样，成为一个熟练的战士。这种天赋使布洛赫成为寻找角斗士和士兵奴隶的奴隶主的目标。了解到自己能力的价值的布罗格人逃离奴隶主，转而成为雇佣兵。",
					"每个brohg都对奥术有一种天然的感觉，这些四臂生物认为奥术是邪灵带给Athas的灾祸。他们认为，奥术师与肮脏的、看不见的生物打交道，所以布洛赫人不信任所有的奥术师，憎恨所有的破坏者。很久以前，一些巨大的伤害可能是通过滥用奥术力量而降临到布洛赫人身上的，或者布洛赫人是通过操纵这种能量而产生的。",
					"每隔一两代，就会有一个布罗格人天生具有奥秘的力量，并在青少年时期表现出来。由于害怕释放邪灵而不敢杀死这个被诅咒的人，部落将这个叛徒放逐到荒野，在那里独自旅行，过着隐士般的生活。很少有这样的叛徒有能力去学习比污秽巫术更难的东西。使用污秽魔法最终会玷污这些叛逆者，而他们认为自己被邪灵附身的信念则加速了他们的堕落。",
					"邂逅",
					"布罗格人饲养坚韧的野兽作为宠物。他们也与大地生物结盟，如加勒布-杜赫、其他巨人和一些人形生物。一个布罗格人可能会在文明人中或在竞技场上被发现为雇佣兵或奴隶兵。邪恶的生物与邪恶的布洛克叛徒联合起来，在少数情况下，这种叛徒把自己设定为其他堕落的布洛克的主人。",
					"Info",
					"布洛赫人不喜欢施法者，并对诽谤者和滥用奥术的人感到愤怒。这种才能在布罗格人的部落中是禁忌。当一个布罗格人出生后能够使用魔法时，它就被打上了同类中的叛逆者的烙印。"

					"圣人认为，僵尸仙人掌是由使用幻术的奴隶主创造的陷阱，并得到破坏者的帮助，但他们的创造物最终无法控制。那些没有被摧毁的仙人掌找到了它们进入沙漠的方式。猎人仙人掌是机会主义的猎手，它们在猎物丰富的地方生长和停留，从贫瘠的狩猎场转移。它们依靠自己的伪装，等待分心的或不注意的生物靠近。仙人掌可能会偶尔留下一具尸体而不吃掉，希望能吸引食腐动物来做一顿更好的饭。猎手仙人掌的肉是多汁的、有营养的，是对那些翻脸的人的美味回报。",
					"邂逅",
					"僵尸仙人掌单独存在，或在一小块地方存在于一些鲛人之中。有时僵尸仙人掌会成对出现。 虽然简单而自利，但僵尸仙人掌的狡猾程度很低。它们可能与引诱猎物的生物形成短期联盟。少数人被迫为更强大的生物服务，并不断寻找机会逃跑。",
					"人类可以通过喂养捕食性植物来训练猎手仙人掌与他们共存。这样的仙人掌学会了攻击除其通常的喂食者之外的入侵者，成为容易被忽视的守护者。",
					"Info",
					"猎人仙人掌长着毒针和长长的进食刺，就像一个普通的沙漠植物，直到毫无戒心的猎物走得太近。猎人仙人掌与周围的普通仙人掌融为一体。等待生物停下来，从植物中获取养料。它发射毒刺，然后用它的进食刺注射（%0%）和迷失方向的猎物。仙人掌感兴趣的是食物而不是战斗。一旦它抓到了猎物，它就会试图阻止其他攻击者，这样它就可以逃跑去觅食。"

					"探险家在一堆松散的泥土中筛选，寻找珍贵的水。眨眼间，她摔倒在地，被一个跃起的、覆盖着岩石板的恐怖东西压倒。她的同伴们转身要跑，但随着一声响亮的轰鸣，一团土壤和石头凝聚在他们周围，将他们吞没。这些野兽喜欢玩弄它们的食物，更喜欢在杀戮之前进行战斗的食物--它们可能会挑起攻击，只是为了有机会向攻击者发泄。德雷克会用它的土元素球体尽可能多地攻击目标，长到巨大的尺寸来恐吓和折磨无法动弹的猎物。"

					"新朱斯特纳尔",
					"在他复活之后，德雷戈斯逃到了朱斯特纳尔的废墟之下，为自己组建另一支军队。这个地下城市充满了新的德雷，由他们的恐惧之王创造。这些新吉斯坦纳尔德雷是为了向那些阻止他们的创造者获得神性和龙性的人复仇而饲养的。"

					"尖叫声和夜风中令人作呕的甜味警告旅行者，沙丘收割者群体正在附近狩猎。当发光的眼睛像漂浮的灯笼一样在黑暗的沙丘上闪闪发光时，逃跑已经不可能了。",
					"Lore",
					"这些领地掠夺者是通过玷污魔法而存在的。沙丘收割者吞噬它们发现的一切。它们吞噬人类和野兽，吃植物，甚至咀嚼马车和建筑物。它们有时会吃石头来帮助消化更坚硬的材料。长时间没有食物的死神会采用食人的方式。被称为 \"骄傲 \"的家族式群体会分成几群，在荒原上捕猎。一个王族在水源附近安家，形成一个蜂巢，成为王族领土的中心。蜂巢是由沙子、泥土和岩石组成的土堆，用无人机的分泌物密封起来。巢穴内有隧道和密室，可能与现有的地下空间或结构相连，特别是那些含有水源的地方。只有当收割者有另一个丰富的食物来源时，人类才能在靠近蜂巢的地方生存。",
					"沙丘收割者战士总是雌性的，统治着较小的无人机和嘶吼者，这些人都是雄性。每个战士与多个无人机和嘶吼者组成一个狩猎群，作为伴侣；如果她被杀，其他收割者会变得不稳定。一个战士的配偶在力量上与她密切相关，以确保只有最强壮的收割者才会繁殖。蜂群中占主导地位的雌性，被称为母皇，做出所有决定，引导蜂群进入新的领域，并指导追随者创建蜂巢。只有在生死决斗中打败她的另一只雌性，才能解除母皇的地位。",
					"沙丘收割者在每年的交配季节是非常危险的，他们会猎取猎物来喂养成长中的孩子。群体的母体将卵产在生物的体内。当蛋孵化时，年轻的收割者会吞噬无助的俘虏。更强壮的幼崽会向它们的兄弟姐妹下手，杀死并吃掉弱小者。活下来的年轻收割者在大约两个月后被赶出蜂巢，必须加入另一个蜂群或组建一个新的蜂群。这些幼虫和成年虫一样致命。",
					"邂逅",
					"沙丘收割者成群结队地捕猎，其数量从五人到十几人不等。沙丘收割者是一个有耐心和计算能力的猎手，它了解猎物的旅行模式，并能在一个隐蔽的位置保持其背包数天。",
					"沙丘收割者在与它的族群隔离的情况下非常具有攻击性，这使得它很难被驯服。尽管如此，阿塔斯人还是很重视这些野兽，将其作为竞技场上的战斗人员，以及皮革、盔甲板和骨刀的来源。罕见的是，一窝收割者幼崽在孵化过程中会在人类身上留下印记。",
					"Info",
					"沙丘收割者族长领导着狩猎群。这些巨大的恐怖动物挥舞着巨大的臂刃，用强大的下颚咬住它们的猎物。当收割者探测到猎物时，它就会和它的盟友一起冲上前去，快速杀戮。它的信息素和战术领导力使其他族群成员在战斗中更加危险。当战斗进行得不顺利时，母兽会撤退以寻求增援，并让嘶吼者牺牲自己来阻碍追击。"

					"Lore",
					"沙丘潜行者看起来像人一样。它大约有7英尺高，但如果伸展开来或被迫直立，会更高。它的头是三角形的，颈部连接在头顶附近，导致它那张淫荡的、有牙齿的脸和尖尖的下巴挂在肩膀下面。沙丘潜行者笨重的身体没有毛发，其红色的、布满灰尘的、磨损的皮肤没有毛孔。短腿、长臂和弯腰的姿势相结合，使它的手在地上拖动。它的手指和脚趾（每个肢体上有四个）长而有骨。这种生物有巨大的肩膀和一个巨大的胸部，然后逐渐缩小到一个狭窄的腰部和臀部。沙丘潜行者被其召唤者指派了一项任务，它追求字面意义上的履行其指示，而不顾其他一切。它憎恨自己在物质世界的时间，并希望在那里的停留时间越短越好。偶尔，召唤者的指示被表述为沙丘潜行者无法真正执行它们。在这种情况下，它被困于物质界，在那里它通过杀死所有它发现的生物来发泄它的挫折感。尽管沙丘潜行者有声波能力，但它们不会说话，不过它们能听懂普通话和泰兰德语。",
					"邂逅",
					"沙丘潜行者的首选战术是躲在岩石区，从埋伏处发动攻击。在可能的情况下，它试图通过爬上岩石或结构来隐藏自己，从而获得对手的高位。它通常在攻击开始时使用它的喊叫能力使一群对手迷失方向，然后跃入战斗，发出它的死亡之吻。对付触手可及的敌人，沙丘潜行者通常倾向于只对一个目标施以死亡之吻，而不是对整个群体施以呼喊。首选的目标是它想要杀死的人，或者是带来最大危险的人，或者是看起来有最强的善的结盟的人。(鉴于沙丘潜行者的疯狂心理，最后一个目标几乎可以是任何人，但圣骑士通常都很突出）。"

					"Lore",
					"伟大的Eladrin王国曾经横跨风中之地，但几个世纪以来，精灵的另一个世界已经慢慢消退，被蹂躏阿萨斯的污秽魔法所吞噬。随着他们的世界的消亡，翡冷翠王国也陷入了废墟。埃拉德林人现在居住在少数几个宫殿和城堡里，是他们以前人数的一小部分残余。他们用幻觉和幻术的迷宫守卫着通往他们衰落的境界的隐秘之门。",
					"少数的艾拉德林人被他们领域的缓慢死亡所扭曲，变得如此充满仇恨，以至于他们牺牲自己来猎杀那些被他们指责为家园毁灭的人。这些风行者让他们的精气神慢慢渗入风中之地，以换取该平面的能量注入。他们在艾拉德林土地附近的贸易通道上出没，杀死每一个他们能抓到的没有保护的人类。在他们存在的最后几年里，风行者会消退成鬼魂般的半固体化身，充满了谋杀的仇恨。",
					"邂逅",
					"艾拉德林与他们的精灵表亲没有什么共同之处，但两个种族都承认他们古老的亲属关系并尊重它。艾拉德林的使者可能会和精灵部落一起旅行一段时间，以监视阿萨斯的沙漠和城市。更加凶恶的艾拉德林人，尤其是风行者，偶尔会与居住在他们领地边缘的强盗或其他暴力的人族混在一起。",
					"Info",
					"这些神秘而强大的通灵者是唯一的女性Eladrin。她们指导着艾拉德林人，在艾拉德林人的社会中充当圣人、神谕和精神领袖。她们很少在阿萨斯世界出现，大部分人都呆在濒临死亡的风中之地，但有时也会有一些人跨越面纱，在荒原上采取行动。一位白衣女子用她的幻觉塑造了战场，用她纯粹的意志改变了世界。她从远处支持戴着面纱的艾拉德林战士和风行者，如果她的生命受到威胁，就会退回到虚无缥缈的地方。"

					"Lore",
					"鸟类是具有元素力量的神秘生物，在占卜艺术方面具有强大的力量。他们是神谕者、占卜者，以及过去、现在和未来知识的预言家。每个怪人都是由四种元素（气、土、火或水）之一的材料组成，并对其元素所关联的命运的特定方面有特殊的了解（见下文）。这些生物居住在物质世界的偏远或隐蔽的地方，这一事实使寻求他们咨询的人难以前往。怪人的上半身总是类似于一个美丽的女性人形。下半身可能是人形或蛇形的柱子。一个怪人从相应的元素池中升起，它永远不会离开。",
					"诡异的人可以占卜可能改变历史进程的信息。它掌握着命运的脉搏，清楚地知道可能的行动路线会指向哪里。像大多数预言家一样，一个元素怪人从来没有提供一个清晰、简洁的预言。有些信息可能看起来很直率，但有些总是令人困惑，或者只是难以破译，因为听众没有足够的信息来理解怪人的意思。虽然它的信息可能被误解，但怪人的警告和建议永远不会错。然而，它的建议很少是免费的，所以任何向怪人求教的人最好带着祭品，或者准备进行对该生物至关重要的探索。",
					"邂逅",
					"所有鸟类，无论它们的元素亚型如何，都以基本的方式相互联系。他们共享一种独特的、秘密的纽带，这种纽带在他们的合作程度上得到了证明。一个不能向祈求者提供所需知识的怪兽通常会引导他或她去找另一个怪兽以获得更好的建议。不同元素的怪人常常把他们的池子放在彼此附近，以扩大一个地区的祈求者可获得的占卜服务范围。鸟人与物质世界有着密切的联系。他们都选择离开自己的本土位面，为人形种族担任占卜师。虽然他们被束缚在他们的池子里，但鸟人可以通过专门从事占卜魔法的凡人代理人与其他种族互动。",
					"如果可以避免，元素鸟不会战斗。如果它们必须战斗，它们首先会召唤元素体来保护自己。如果有任何其他元素体存在（无论哪种类型），该怪兽就会试图获得对它们的控制权，并让它们对抗它的敌人。同时，怪人留在水池中央，使用占卜魔法预见战斗的可能后果并采取相应行动。如果被迫进入近战，怪兽会利用它的伸手向附近的敌人猛攻。如果受到严重威胁，怪兽就会退回到它的原点。",
					"元素池",
					"每个怪人都住在一个大池子里（至少20英尺宽，40英尺深），里面充满了最纯粹的元素。池子总是被固定在一个平面上（地板、墙壁或天花板；可能的方向见个别条目），这样它的深度在该表面上形成一个空洞。该表面必须有足够的深度来容纳水池。一个元素池也可以作为同一元素的更大体积内的一个独立区域存在；例如，一个水怪的池子可能位于海洋或湖泊的底部。池子的底部有一个通往该怪人的本位面的入口。被怪人准许进入池子的生物必须提供自己的保护，使其不受元素物质的影响，并提供在该环境中呼吸和移动的方法。否则，他们就会受到个别条目中给出的影响。一个怪人在身体上被束缚在它的池子里，除了通过传送门回到它的本位面外，不能离开。怪人可以上升到离水池表面10英尺的高度，但其身体的下半部分必须始终与元素物质保持接触。一旦怪人离开池子回到它的本位面，传送门就会关闭，池子就会失去它的特殊效果。空气池。一个空气怪兽的池子里充满了波涛汹涌的、可呼吸的空气和雾气的蒸汽。没有飞行能力的生物无法在其中移动，除非是坠落。空气怪人的池子可以贴在任何垂直或水平的表面上，它可以朝上或朝下（例如，如果贴在天花板上）。火池。这个池子里有一股跳舞的火焰，不断地燃烧和冒烟。在火池中没有保护的易燃物会立即着火，在火池中的任何生物每回合都会受到3d10的火焰伤害。没有飞行能力的生物不能在这个池子里移动，除非是坠落。一个火怪的池子可以贴在任何垂直或水平的表面上，而且它只能以右面朝上的姿势出现（比如在洞穴的地板上）。土池。这个池子里充满了搅动的泥浆、岩石和土。每个在其中的生物（除了土怪和土元素）每回合都会从不断碾压的泥土中受到4d8的打击伤害。此外，进入池子的生物如果没有办法呼吸就会窒息，如果不能钻洞就会被禁锢（限制）。土怪的池子只能贴在水平面上，而且只能出现在右侧的位置（例如在洞穴的地板上）。水池。这个水池充满了冒泡的、旋转的水。任何在其中不能呼吸水的生物都会立即开始淹死。任何没有游泳能力的生物都无法在水潭中移动，除非是掉下去。一个水怪的池子只能贴在一个水平的表面上，而且它只能出现在一个右侧的位置上（比如在洞穴的地板上）。",

					"孤独的野猪总是试图伏击它的猎物。当它出击时，它以恐惧的吼声开始战斗，希望能分散敌人的注意力并削弱其力量。然后，野牦牛会冲入战斗，依靠快速的攻击来迅速击倒猎物。"

Today, the descendants of the first githyanki survive as shadows of their former selves, decayed in both mind and body. They have not forgotten their origins however. A few tribes are dedicated to gathering shards of their long-lost ship, hoping to return home. Gith tribes wander the mountains and the Tablelands living as nomadic hunters. Like thri-kreen tribes, gith grant humanoids no special status hunting them as avidly as any other prey.",
					"邂逅",
					"Gith travel in small packs though sometimes an individual can be found with other creatures, working as a mercenary or as a slave. Gith also keep pets such as baazrags. Although most gith attack foulspawn on Sight a few tribes have begun to collaborate with these aberrations toward some shared ambition.",
					"Info",
					"Gith are a lanky race of reptilian humanoids that, when erect, stand close to seven feet tall, but who spend most of their time, bent‐over in a crouch that makes them appear to be only five feet tall. Their powerful legs allow them to make great leaps, which they use to move about, walking in an awkward waddle only when they cannot jump or when sneaking up on prey."

					"Lore",
					"A grisgol is a horrifying construct composed of broken and worn-out magic items, animated by a powerful spellcaster who has harnessed the spirit of a lich. Its skeleton is fabricated from old staffs and wands and its skin from expended scrolls wrapped about it like a mummy's burial cloth. Woven into this are rings, bracers, fragments of leather or chainmail, and the like. Inside the creature are scores of half-empty vials of potions, unguents, and oils, vaguely resembling sets of internal organs. It typically wears a rune-scribed cloak or robe. Pinpoints of red light glare from underneath a hood or old helmet. Nestled inside the construct, among miscellaneous junk, is the original lich's phylactery. Unless one knows what animates a grisgol, the phylactery appears as another piece of spent magic trash tossed loosely and randomly into the insides of the construct. From a distance, a grisgol appears to be a mummy, even moving with a similar stiff gait. When it walks, one can hear the tinkling of glass touching glass, the sloshing of half-filled vials and bottles, the squeaking of leather, the rubbing of wood and bone against each other, and, most prominently, the shuffl ing of paper as if pages of a tome were caught in a slight breeze. Thin tendrils of black smoke escape from cracks in its body. A grisgol leaves a sooty, oily residue upon whatever it touches. A grisgol is in every way a magic construct, possessing all traits native to golems in addition to the abilities of the lich that powers it. A grisgol's damaging and paralyzing touch attacks are the same as a lich and the construct retains a fraction of the original lich's spell-casting ability. A grisgol only casts the spells scribed by its creator on the scrolls and tome pages that make up its outer skin.",
					"The spells a grisgol can cast are, however, restricted to the spell levels, domains, and specializations the lich (a 20th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard) could have cast. Destroying a grisgol does not destroy the lich that powers it. To kill the lich, its phylactery must be destroyed after the grisgol is destroyed. Otherwise, the lich is free to return in a physical form in 1d10 days. The escaped lich retains all the powers and abilities it had previous to its entrapment. The lich seeks vengeance upon whoever possesses its phylactery and the wizard, sorcerer, or cleric who originally entrapped it in the body of a grisgol. A grisgol stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds. It knows all the languages known by the lich whose phylactery animates it.",
					"邂逅",
					"Grisgol are rare, even by golem standards. They are solitary construct that exist solely to serve the will of their master. Once this master has died it continues to fulfil his duty, oblivious of the pointless reason behind it. In the region of Raam, particularly ancient tombs are rumored to hold mysterious string of parchment, driving those reading them to madness and death. Other reports from adventurers tell the stories of strange mummies invulnerable to most of their known weaknesses.",
					"Lich sometimes create grisgol as punishment for their rivals, hiding their phylactery in the construct and sending them to impossible and pointless mission. They are reveling in the knowledge that their enemy can do nothing but rage silently while his immortality is wasted away."

The victim always thinks, and tries to convince others, that he is on the brink of a revelation.

The victim of the curse loses {@dice 1d4} point of Intelligence per day. Once it reach 0, the creature dies. The Intelligence cannot be restored while the curse is lasting.

Halfling tribes on Athas openly practice cannibalism, though usually as a ritualistic matter. Though they rarely deal with outsiders, halflings have been known to work with others for mutual gain. However, anyone who breaks an oath to a halfling tribe will find himself or herself quickly pursued by a band of head hunters. These marauders pose a threat to any traveler who wanders into their hunting grounds.",

They wield great influence among their kind, repaying that respect by preserving halfling traditions and lore and by shielding the tribe from harm. Forest keepers prefer to remain at range.

It takes {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the {@condition restrained} target can make a Strength check against your power's save {@dc 13}. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer {@condition restrained} by the hand."

The skin color of hej-kin varies greatly, from deep red to a dark mossy green. Most hejkin clans will usually be all of the same color skin, and most tend to be reddish and orange colored. The skin of a hej-kin is thick and very tough, similar in texture to softened leather hide.",

					"Most clans make their homes in caverns adjacent to underground streams providing the clan with an adequate supply of water. Unlike many other types of subterranean dwellers, hej-kin do not dig tunnels or caves, for doing so would disturb the earth, which they consider sacred.",
					"The average hej-kin clan contains four to five families, each consisting of three to six members. A family's living area is usually a smaller cave connected by tunnel to the cavern occupied by the rest of the clan. Hej-kin mark their dwellings by runes on the outer cave walls.",
					"Hej-kin are omnivores, relying on both meat and vegetables as sources of food. Most of their food comes from subterranean plants and small underground creatures."

Unknown, perhaps unknowable, dangers lie in wait on all sides: Boulders conceal vicious predators, a gloomy cave harbors cruel slave hunters, and forest canopies shadow far more than shrubs. The id fiend revels in these doubts, using them against its prey, magnifying anxieties until the line between fantasy and reality is shattered.",

					"Kanks are large docile insects often used as mounts by the people of the Tablelands. A black exoskeleton of chitin covers their segmented bodies.

Around their mouths, they have multi-jointed pincers that they can use to carry objects, feed themselves, or fight. Six lanky legs descend from their thoraxes. Each ends in a single flexible claw that allows them to grip the surfaces they walk upon.",

As the kirre grows hungry and its prey grows fatigued, the beast draws closer. The kirre attacks only when the quarry is weakened or distracted, or when it appears the prey might escape. The kirre leaps at its prey, raking with its claws before springing away. When it closes for good, the beast viciously rips its victim apart."

The kirre is eight feet in length and has eight legs, each ending in paws that sport very sharp claws. The kirre also has large horns on either sides of its head and a sharp barbed tail spike often used as a weapon. The mouth of the kirre is large and has sharp, canine teeth, which are used mostly for tearing food that has been killed. The kirre is a fur-covered animal with coloration similar to a tiger (both are striped). However, where a tiger are is striped in black and orange, the kirre is striped in brown and grey. This coloration is consistent all over the kirre's body, with the exception of its face, which is all grey.",
					"Kirres are normally solitary creatures, until the approach of their mating season, at which time a male and female will join and produce offspring. Kirre litters number from three to five young. Kirres are mammals, and females produce milk for their young. Young kirres survive on milk for the first five months, at which point they begin to eat solid food such as small forest animals and other mammals.",
					"Kirre are a favorite game of many hunting tribes of races who live in the forests of Athas. The meat from kirres is some of the finest on all of Athas, and many seek after it. Aside from a source of food, the kirre also has other uses when killed. The creature's horns can be cut off and used as spearheads; in some cases, they can be carved into ornate daggers. In addition, the tail of a kirre has a sharp, bone spike at its end that can be fashioned into either an arrowhead or a dart."

At birth, a megapede is 20 to 30 feet long, growing to its full size within three months after birth.

					"Lore",
					"Long before luckless travelers in more remote and foreboding marshes see the harrowing sight of a lone night twist, they hear its haunting and melancholy song. The ghostly moaning sounds of its song seem slightly different to every traveler. For some, the song of the night twist sounds like a women weeping. To others, it is more akin to a wind blowing over a desolate graveyard. Most likely, the despair song of a night twist is the most sorrowful sound each traveler can conjurer within his or her own mind. Night twists subsist in the most inhospitable marshes, mudflats and ruins feeding on the rotting carcasses of creatures and travelers attracted by its despair song.",
					"Night Twist grow on cursed ground, defiled lands and battlefield, feeding of the lasting negative energies running throught the land. They feed on necrotic energies, and as such are often mistaken for Trees of Death. This mistake is often the last one made.",
					"邂逅",
					"Rangers of the tablelands have heard and felt the despair song of night twists coming from the Black Sands region. These night twists watch over the unplundered tombs, buried deep in the land in ancient times. Much older night twists can be found throughout the Dry Marsh and the Crescent Forest, taking root in and around the cyclopean ruins of fallen giant cities, their songs of despair luring explorers to a swift doom.",
					"A night twist, when actively seeking victims, sends out its despair song in order to bring prey to it. When those lured by the song are within range, a night twist uses its phantasmal killer spell-like ability. A night twist employs its powerful slam attack only if opponents first survive the illusion. The creature uses its entangle and darkness spell-like abilities to keep opponents from escaping. When a night twist feels threatened, it uses its wind attack and fear spelllike ability."

The nightmares and resulting damage affect the subject every night until the curse is removed or the victim dies. If the curse is removed, the victim remains fatigued for 24 hours thereafter. A heal spell or more powerful magic cast while the subject is in the throes of a nightmare is the only way to remove a night twist's death curse. If the victim of a night twist victim dies and is interred, a new night twist springs from where the corpse was laid one month later.

These horrors are a cancer on the world, their noxious presence poisoning land and contaminating water.

Each nightmare beast was once another, more mundane predator of the wastelands. In rare instances, as an animal consumes prey within areas connected to the Gray or imbued with substantial defiling magic, the creature slowly begins to change. Energy courses through it, causing it to grow and to develop a limitless hatred for all living things. Once the tainted creature begins to seek and consume sentient beings, it mutates into a nightmare beast.",
					"Nightmare beast spawn aren't progeny - they are a stage of mutation that some creatures reach before full metamorphosis is achieved.",
					"This, of course, leads to other questions: Why do these creatures all mutate into the same form? Do other, related mutations haunt the farthest reaches of the wastes?",
					"Info",
					"A maw of gladius-sized teeth splits a hulking form covered in armored scales. Tusks as sharp and numerous as the spears of a phalanx sprout from this opening. A nightmare beast stands at least 20 feet tall on its four legs. Each of its digits is tipped with a 3-foot-long claw. Its jaws are filled with 1-foot-long teeth and flanked by curved tusks the size of cavalry lances. A nightmare beast's thick, tough hide is typically dark gray with dark blue, purple, or brown splotches in between patches of bony material. Its red eyes, each the size of a man's head, glow in the dark. The nightmare beast prefers to lair in a remote cave. It spends most of its time in search of food, and it tends to hunt in one area until the food supply is exhausted. At that point, it usually hibernates for up to one year, then awakens again in a ravenous state. Surely nothing so nightmarish could be a living being-and yet it is. The nightmare beast is always ravenous, a mobile source of carnage. The more the beast's hunger is frustrated, the greater the frenzy of its attacks.",
					"Hatred consumes a nightmare beast - only through supreme willpower does it resist its brutish impulses. When possessed of its full faculties, the beast torments its enemies, sending them into nightmare-filled slumber. While its victim thrashes, the beast appears at its side where it can sample the horror firsthand. If a nightmare beast becomes injured, all thought of toying with its enemies vanishes. Its barely contained monstrous nature surges to the fore. Roaring with rage, it rises up on its hind legs, savagely slashing, impaling, and destroying its enemies. The putrid essence of a nightmare beast taints everything around it when the beast dies. At the Dungeon Master's option, the area within 30ft of a slain nightmare beast becomes defiled terrain."

No matter where they make their lairs, nightmare beasts do so in a consistent manner. All beast lairs are very defensible and well protected.

					"Fallen Sphinxes, whether through the weariness of the ages, corrupted by the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, protosphinxes broke free of their divine command. Once freed of their servitude to the forgotten gods of Athas many sphinxs became protosphinx, abandoning their divine mission to become above all else, aggressive and animalistic creatures who lives up to the vicious reputation of their patron animal, the large and violent crocodile.",
					"However, even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it deem's worthy. Despite their feral appearances and their obvious cruelty protosphinxes are clever manipulators that still obey to old divine laws. They follow the tradition of magical tests, expecting the failure of the contestant and an easy meal. However, they always make sure that one of them escape alive so the tell of their buried treasure keeps spreading and food keeps coming.",
					"In some reagions of the desert they are seen as cruel but benevolent patron, protecting a community and helping it prosper with its magic in exchange of frequent and bloody sacrifices.",
					"Some protosphinx are plainly mad, vicious creatures that do not obey any of their specie's dogma. These sphinxes are the ones that have been played by explorers and adventurers, cheated of their treasure or secrets in a deceitful way. They succumb to madness without the support of their deity and quickly after transform into a protosphinx, only driven by vengeance. The only way to appease the monster is to retrieve its treasure or to make sure its secret is safe once again.",
					"邂逅",
					"Protosphinxes can be found all over Athas, guarding forgotten temples where no worship has been uttered in millenias, watching over treasure rooms in lost cities. The Tablelands are famous for the high number of ruins that can be found there, and therefor protosphinxes are more common in this region. The south of the Great Alluvial Sand Wastes, getween the Giant's Ribs Mountains and the Screaming Ravine is known to be the home of at least two of this monstrosity, but none has been brave enough to follow the creatures to their lair and discover what could have spawn two of them.",
					"The most famous of the protosphinx is certainly Munakhtmou, lurking in the ruins of Balshara, at the foot of the Black Spine Mountains. Munakhtmou is known to keep no treasure or secret, but instead receive the worship of a growing community of escaped slaves, nomads and sheperds. The sphinx receives the sacrifices of intelligent humanoid and in exchange uses his magic to fertilise the land and defend the community against raiders and slavers."

					"The rakshasa employs delicacy and misdirection in its pursuit of dominion over others. Few creatures ever see the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it wants, although it prefers to masquerade as someone powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich merchant, for example. A rakshasa's true form combines the features of a human and a tiger, with one noteworthy deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.",
					"Rakshasas originated long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret.",
					"For a rakshasa, death on the Material Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its body reforms - a process that cart take months or years. When the rakshasa is reborn, it has all the memories and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution against the one who slew it. If the target has somehow slipped through its grasp, the rakshasa might punish its killer's family, friends, or descendants. Like devils, rakshasas killed in the Nine Hells are forever destroyed.",
					"邂逅",
					"Mountains of the Teeth: A low range of dry, knife-edged peaks, the Mountains of the Teeth are home to hostile tribes of tareks and minotaurs. The mountains also hide several mysterious, ancient monasteries the strongholds of rakshasa princes. Ranging out from these isolated retreats, rakshasa spies roam the Tyr Region, secretly plotting to turn the sorcerer-kings against one another and enslave the city-states.",
					"Rising out of the dust like the shattered fang of an enormous beast, Roqom appears only at the peak of midday on the hottest days of the year. This sharp, jagged spire of basalt lies in the wilderness beyond the Beastbarrens, but according to legend, it appears wherever its master can work the greatest mischief. The master of Roqom is Fajjayad, a great rakshasa prince, and he occasionally uses magical sendings tolure silt sailors and travelers to his black palace especiallytravelers who have a desperate need of some sort. Fajjayad claims to be able to provide for any such needs in exchange for services to be rendered within 1,001 days. The rakshasa is unfailingly polite and candid. If asked, he freely admits that the task he sets is likely to be difficult, even deadly, and that his \"clients\" might die while attempting it. However, Fajjayad assures them that \"the laws\" (a term he does not define) forbid him from setting a task that is impossible or whose outcome is certain death. For his magic to work, the task must have an element of chance and uncertainty. Still, if any group has ever profited from Fajjayad's bargain, its tale is not known.",
					"Info",
					"Rakshasa ruhk, or knights, are the warrior of their people, protecting rajah nobles and hunting heroes and good hearted individuals opposing the plots of rakshasa princes. They like to play with their prey before giving them the final blow and are cruel creatures, though not as manipulative as the rest of their kind, they are clever tacticians and are not above using ruse to trick their quarry into a disadvantageous situation. Ruhks are very confident warriors, sure of their abilities and certain that their natural immunities give them domination over any mortal warrior."

					"Rakshasa society is bound by rigid castes. Each rakshasa is born into a particular role in life and cannot advance. Females (known as rakshasi) are fit to be consorts, honored only by their faithfulness and the fighting ability of their children. There are 2 to 3 females per male. Rakshasa society is led by a rajah or maharajah, whose commands are to be obeyed without question. Rakshasas wage war on humanity constantly, not only to feed themselves but because they believe that battle is the only way to gain honor. If confronted by humans who recognize their true appearance, they are insufferably arrogant. A rakshasa's life varies in cycles of wild self-indulgence in times of prosperity and strict fasting and sacrifice in times of trouble or before battle. They are honorable creatures but will twist the wording of an agreement to suit their purposes. They prefer to deal with humanity by using their illusion powers to deceive and manipulate them, but are brave and forthright in battle."

					"Ak'chazar rakshasas wander the planes seeking new lands to subjugate and new undead minions to enslave. These rakshasas are masters of necromantic magic, although they are powerful in the other schools of magic as well. Ak'chazar rakshasas typically work behind the scenes, manipulating events to suit their dark whims and relying on their web of spies, assassins, and intelligent undead to carry out their nefarious plots. Ak'chazar rakshasas do associate with other rakshasas, often as leaders or manipulators. Other types of rakshasas value an ak'chazar's intelligence even as they fear its abilities. It is not uncommon for weaker rakshasas to follow the complex plans of an ak'chazar even as they go about their own missions. All rakshasas tend toward solitary existences, but communication and coordination between the various kinds is not unheard of.",
					"An ak'chazar rakshasa typically establishes a power base at the site of a great battle, a city of the dead, or some other place where a large number of corpses might be interred. It uses its power over undead to create several intelligent undead minions. Thereafter, it might make contact with a local underworld organization (almost always through intermediaries) or even a corrupt or power-hungry political official.",
					"It will play with these leaders, offering them advice, power, or riches as it learns their habits and defining characteristics. Then the ak'chazar uses its magic jar spell-like ability to replace one of these leaders for a time, using the borrowed body to solidify its hold on the region.",
					"Several of the House Tsalaxa high officials are actually ak'chazar rakshasas. They sequester themselves in foreboding strongholds or warehouses hidden in the waste, although some have made lairs closer to the heart of civilization in the city states. At least one ak'chazar rakshasa operates from within Balic, lending his services and undead minions in exchange for special favors too terrible to ponder."

These naztharune rakshasas have already compromised several local guilds and eliminated key politicians and merchants in an attempt to turn the cities' hatred of one another into open war.

A salt mummy is usually encountered by miners working a new deposit. It appears at first to be nothing more than an old, salt-rimed corpse.

The shuddering crack as a salt mummy breaks away from a salt vein is a dreadful thing to hear.",

					"Scrabs are small, three-sectioned, insect-like men who live in nests in the desert. They are highly intelligent, and some of them are even able to cast spells. No small group of travellers is safe in the vicinity of a scrab nest.",
					"Scrabs live in the sandy wastes, or in the sandy areas of the rocky barrens. They need little water, perhaps 1/20th of what a human needs. Scrabs also seem to get all of the liquid they need from the blood of their victims. A scrab's niche in the environment is strictly that of a predator, although scrabs are also preyed upon by the larger creatures that inhabit the wastes.",
					"Scrabs live in large nests tunnelled under the sand. They produce a spittle that solidifies the sand. Because of the ever-present sandstorms, the scrab nest is usually located 15 feet under the surface. If available, a rocky outcropping is used to hide and protect the entrance. Scrabs are excellent tunnellers, and if the nest collapses on them they just dig it out again. A scrab can hold its breath for up to an hour under sand and even gets a bit of air from the surrounding sand. This is due to the long gills through which scrabs breath. These gills are located all along the grooves in their shells."

A darter tips its darts with a fast-acting, immobilizing poison, which it produces from glands in its mouth.

At night it reflects any ambient light, retaining its colors but not as radiant as during the day. When the spider has fed, it takes on a reddish tinge but this fades over a few days. A crystal spider is incapable of making sounds, but can communicate with others of its kind by means of controlled light. Crystal spiders get most of their nutrients from sunlight but do require liquids to survive, preferring human blood. They are hunted for their webs, which make excellent weapons, and for the gems which they instinctively weave into these webs (although the spiders are themselves unaware of their value).",
					"A typical crystal spider is eight feet long and can live up to 150 years. Before death, a crystal spider will lay a single huge cluster of eggs (as many as 200) in a specially crafted web.",
					"A crystal spider is patient and agile. Its glass webs can slice through bone, and the spider spins them in dim light along the travel route through its lair. The arachnid creeps behind prey, attacking with teeth and razor-sharp legs the moment a creature stumbles into a web. A crystal spider quickly withdraws, only to appear elsewhere in a blinding blaze of light."

Ruled over by their priests, ssurrans hold ancient beliefs in strange gods and have a reputation for barbarism that is perhaps a little undeserved.",
					"When it comes to battle, ssurrans are vicious, disorganized and somewhat cowardly. They prefer to maneuver their opponents into positions of disadvantage and will strike from ambush whenever possible. Ssurrans would rather attack with superior numbers and have been known to flee from battles that they might have won simply because they have believed themselves to be outnumbered. For the ssurrans, the ideal battle is one where you and a large amount of your fellows strike from ambush, surprise the foe and over-run him with sheer numbers. Victorious ssurrans have been known to strip the corpses of the fallen, scarring or otherwise marking the dead as food, for later consumption. Ssurrans strike with dreadfully sharp claws and a savage, snapping bite. Those of a more civilized bent arm themselves with whatever weapons they can find and deal solid, brutal blows with these. Impalers, macahuitl and spears are all popular arms with the ssurrans.",
					"Ssurrans Blackscale",
					"Like their smaller cousins, blackscale ssurran are primitive reptilian humanoids that can be very dangerous if provoked. A blackscale lizardfolk is usually 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 feet tall, and weighs about 600 pounds. Its tail is 4 to 5 feet long.",
					"Blackscale ssurran are proud and fierce fighters, concerned with heroic action and personal glory. Left on their own, they will fight as disorganized individuals, but their leaders can force them to work together for short periods of time. The blackscales have little patience for tricks and traps, considering such tools to be the trade of lesser ssurran. They are proud and arrogant, and are usually extremely hostile toward humans who trespass into the deep deserts where they live. While their culture is quite primitive, the black scales have access to the vaults and arsenals of ancient cities. High-ranking warriors or priests wear glittering bone and primitive ornaments, and the weapons of the blackscales are often elaborately carved and decorated.",
					"The blackscales typically live off the \"tribute\" they extract from the other tribes and merchant house offerings made to prevent them from raiding trade routes. The war priests hold the ultimate authority within society but rarely use this power; in the absence of interference from a priest, the most powerful warrior rules the tribe. Any of the three species of ssurran can be called to serve as a priests; the blackscales consider the priests to be chosen ones, and thus see no shame in following their commands.",
					"Info",
					"Once in a generation a blackscale is born with tremendous strength, ferocity and evil in its heart. These fearsome creatures are touched by the demon lord Sess'inek's and gifted with demonic might. They soon take control of their tribe and quickly conquer other lesser ssurran tribe. Once they have gathered enough members they begin a campaign of slaughter and terror against other intelligent races. If left uncheck these tribe of ssurran can grow in numbers and even pose a threat to the city-states. In combat the blackscale warlord is rushing in the melee, killing everything that crosses his path."

The town of Gerot, nestled beneath a mountain range northeast of Raam, met with a particularly unpalatable end. According to legend, Gerot's people were great warriors, haughty and proud. They impressed Grand Vizier Abalach-Re, who offered the mountain community an alliance if its fighters would join Raam's legions. In their arrogance, the Gerotians declined, and they killed Abalach-Re's envoys. Enraged, the sorcerer-queen unleashed a vicious curse against Gerot's populace. The townsfolk were struck with an unquenchable thirst. The twisted brilliance behind her curse was that life-sustaining, pure water would bring death to any Gerotian. Within days, the entire town had died. What Abalach-Re hadn't expected was that every cursed Gerotian would rise in undeath, becoming the first thraxes.",

It loathes the monster it has become, but it cannot stop; its thirst is unbearable. Some thraxes seek revenge on Abalach-Re, and they haunt Raam and drink the sorcerer-queen's supporters dry. Because the corpse of a thrax victim is so easily recognized, few thrax live in cities or villages. Instead, they haunt the wastelands, oasis, and trade routes.",

Its facial features develop a gaunt, angular cast and its eyes become a deep blue. The most striking change is in its hands.

Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible.

However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him.

He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated.

Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies.

Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible. The means by which a templar might gain power and position are wide open, including bribery, theft, and even assassination of others within their ranks.

However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",

He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated.

Lalali-Puy's most trusted advisor, and second in command, wears ten necklaces. The lowliest templars wear only one.",
					"Info",
					"The elite warriors of Gulg are known as judaga. They are half-hunter and half-fighter, depending upon stealth to ambush their enemies and bows and arrows or {@condition poisoned} darts to slay them. Gulg does not have a landed nobility in the same manner as other city-states; agriculture is not prevalent, so owning property is not a sign of wealth. Instead, the noble class of Gulg is a meritocracy of hunters. The judagas warriors also serve as the heart of the army, although Gulg rarely goes to war openly. The term \"judaga\" means \"headhunter\" and refers to the hunters' practice of taking the heads of their enemies as trophies. They know a ritual that can trap the soul of a deceased warrior in its own skull, and the dagadas of the greatest hunters are adorned with such undead guardians. Judagas have no land or titles to pass on to their descendants, but they compete fiercely for trophies and rich spoils to buy wives, slaves, livestock, and houses full of luxuries that their families can enjoy for generations. A prominent judaga's family remains wealthy and influential long after the individual's death, and young hunters descended from renowned judagas are likely to become judagas themselves."

This bureaucracy is divided into five temples, each overseeing one aspect of governance. A high consort who reports directly to the Shadow King oversees each temple. Only the templars are permitted to enter and leave the sub-city in which his palace is located. Otherwise, the rest of the city is composed entirely of slaves dedicated to making the lives of Nibenay and his templars comfortable and secure.",

When she has need of new ones, she performs divinations to discover young citizens who might be suited for wielding magic. Then she removes the candidates from their families, regardless of caste, and trains them to serve her. The templars take new names and exist outside the caste system, like their mistress. Raam's templars are not bureaucrats; the city-state has many ranks of officials that oversee civil administration. Instead, the templars serve as the eyes and ears of Abalach-Re, representing the Grand Vizier's interests and instructing officials and functionaries in her will. The current disorder and strife in Raam has made it dangerous for templars to walk the streets without armed escorts. Many barricade themselves in their estates, ignoring their duties to their queen.",
					"Info",
					"Rather than quelling the mansabdars' duplicity, Abalach·Re formed the force of high kuotaghas, her secret police. Like the mansabdars, they are an arm of the civic government, loosely overseen by the templars. Little better than assassins, the kuotagha hide among the populace, striking without warning to eliminate undesirables. The high kuotaghas are the sorcerer-queen's most trusted and deadly servants. Like Abalach·Re, a high kuotagha looks weak, decadent, and unarmed. Once an enemy draws near, the assassin's body hardens, its claws extend, and its arm tendons detach from its biceps to form flexible bands. Given the malfeasance of the mansabdars and the breakdown of templar authority, Abalach-Re relies more and more on the kuotagh to enforce her will."

Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible. The means by which a templar might gain power and position are wide open, including bribery, theft, and even assassination of others within their ranks. Every templar NPC can be counted on to accept underhanded schemes that will help him rise to power among his fellows.",
					"In the administration of the city states, templar NPCs occupy all positions from waste removal to the mayorship. Lower-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are given the dirtier jobs tkat require hands-on work, having a few guards at their disposal and fewer slave laborers than tkey need to perform their tasks effectively. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) gain greater responsibilities and may have several lower- ranked templars beneath them. High- Ranked templars (levels 9 and higher) move into management of the city state such templars are difficult to unseat, since they can blame nearly any shortcomings on their underlings.",

Technically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his own city and the templars assure him of worship and obedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god or a demigod, though he is generally an extremely powerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",
					"The DM must keep two things in mind when dealing with any particular templar NPC. First, how will the templar attempt to use the player characters to gain advantage? He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated. Beware, though higher-ranked templars have played these games of treachery before and, by their very existence, they've proven pretty good at them.",

Low-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are common soldiers, guards within the cities around the slave areas practiced and drilled in formations around the city walls. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) are officers in charge of small (10-100 man) units of guards, slave soldiers, or undead soldiers (in times of war). High-Ranked templars (levels 9 +) are usually generals or administrators, keeping the army equipped and fed.",
					"Tyr",
					"The Royal Guard consists of two thousand mercenaries led by five hundred half-giants and Kalak's loyal templars. In fact, the latter are all armed with steel swords. Tyr military strength is renowned, if not as impressive as her rival of Urik, for the city can muster impressive armies in case of open conflict. The city walls are defended by the Jy'Ahlkar, lightly armored mercenaries using fast shooting crossbows and wood tower shield to fight in packed units. The finest of Tyr are the Iron Guard, an elite corp claded in iron armors, commanded by the most trusted advisors of King Kalak's himself. Tyr's Templars rule the city with an iron fist, crushing any sign of rebellion in blood and sending the survivors to the slave pits where they are worked to death in quarries, completing the last pieces of the stone work for Kalak's ziggourat. Kalak also rely on a network of spies and assassasins known to use alchemical bombs and poisons to eliminate the enemies of the state, this feared killers are known as the Alkatesh.",
					"Info",
					"Assassins, alchemist, spies, there are many labels that can be put on the feared akatesh but only one thing that really matters to Tyr's denizen : once you see once, death follow soon after. When an influencial noble displeases King Kalak, when a powerful Templar fall out of the king's grace, the sorcerer-king send one or several alkatesh to take care of the problem. The rumor is that the alkatesh pale complexion come from the fact that they spend most of their time in the Under-Tyr or even lower in the belly of the earth. They are able to see without light and their eyes are colorless and veiled. They live their lives in toxic caves, forgotten temples or endless underground maze, walking them silently until they hear the summoning of the king. Few know how Kalak's gained the loyalty of this corrupted beings, but many connect their first appearance with the beginning of the construction of Kalak's Ziggurat. Alkatesh live out of the templar's structure, they do not hold real political power in Tyr and are unfit to take any official position."

					"Templars",
					"Templars are the most feared people in the city states. Their power to accuse and imprison nearly anyone for any reason keeps the city dwellers in terror. Not surprisingly, templars tend to abuse the powers they have for their own personal gain which, so long as the city is administered and kept in order, does not bother the sorcerer-king. Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible. The means by which a templar might gain power and position are wide open, including bribery, theft, and even assassination of others within their ranks. Every templar NPC can be counted on to accept underhanded schemes that will help him rise to power among his fellows.",
					"In the administration of the city states, templar NPCs occupy all positions from waste removal to the mayorship. Lower-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are given the dirtier jobs tkat require hands-on work, having a few guards at their disposal and fewer slave laborers than tkey need to perform their tasks effectively. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) gain greater responsibilities and may have several lower- ranked templars beneath them. High- Ranked templars (levels 9 and higher) move into management of the city state such templars are difficult to unseat, since they can blame nearly any shortcomings on their underlings.",
					"These are only a sampling of the many levels of templar bureaucracy. Advancement through the ranks has little to do with ability or experience. Technically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his own city and the templars assure him of worship and obedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god or a demigod, though he is generally an extremely powerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",
					"The DM must keep two things in mind when dealing with any particular templar NPC. First, how will the templar attempt to use the player characters to gain advantage? He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated. Beware, though higher-ranked templars have played these games of treachery before and, by their very existence, they've proven pretty good at them.",
					"Duties and Auhtority",
					"Templar soldiers are the enforcement arm of their service to the sorcerer-king. Low-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are common soldiers, guards within the cities around the slave areas practiced and drilled in formations around the city walls. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) are officers in charge of small (10-100 man) units of guards, slave soldiers, or undead soldiers (in times of war). High-Ranked templars (levels 9 +) are usually generals or administrators, keeping the army equipped and fed.",
					"Urich",
					"The sorcerer-king Hamanu boasts about the power of his armies with good reason. Urik is a powerful city-state with teeming armies, enormous walls, bustling commerce, and wise sages, governed in an orderly framework established by the self-styled King of the World. Urik's legions have never met defeat, and Hamanu has never run from battle. Urik's armies are without peer. Not counting the Imperial Guard, which consists of a thousand half-giants, Hamanu can field an army of ten thousand slave warriors and professional soldiers. He is also served by a company of two hundred halfling scouts and slavecatchers sent as a gift from Urga-Zoltapl, chieftain of the Forest Ridge town of Ogo.",
					"Any decision of importance made in the Tyr Region must consider the wishes of Urik's sorcerer-king. The templars insist that Hamanu's Code is a divine gift, a blessing that the sorcerer-king bestowed upon his people so they could prosper and grow. In truth, the laws are oppressive and jealously guard the prerogatives of the king, his templars, and the noble classes. Common Urikite citizens understand that the Code exists to protect the powerful, but they dare not grumble. The only good thing that can be said of the draconian laws is that they discourage street crime.",
					"Hamanu sees the templars as extensions of his will and presence. It is nothing to him to sacrifice a templar, and he discards them as he would slaves. Templars fulfill many functions in the city-state: enforcing laws, collecting taxes, overseeing slaves, leading warriors in battle, and ferreting out enemies of the state. They wear yellow cloaks or capes as their badge of office; no one else is permitted to wear similar garments. Although low-ranking templars live under military discipline, high-ranking templars are awarded noble titles and rich estates as signs of Hamanu's favor.",
					"Info",
					"Few know that at the heart of Destiny's Kingdom, the fortress of king Hamanu, is located the King's Academy, one of the most prestigious monastic school of the Way. Those entering the school are taken as children, stolen from their family and indoctrinated by the priest of the Lion God to the worship of the sorcerer-king Hamanu. Masters of the Way teach this children how to harnest their psionic powers and use them as a weapon for the glory of their king. Most of this children become fanaticaly devoted Templars when they reach adulthood. The monks of Urich follow a harsh martial training and live in stern conditions, they preach above all the worship of the Lion God and serve at his temple. In combat, the cenobites put their training to good use, stricking with a flurry of blows empowered by the psychic powers. If needed they can fight from a distance with psionic assaults but prefer to close in with their blurring speed if they can.",

					"The itinerant thri-kheen are fierce warriors",
					"and pragmatic hunters. They form deep bonds to their birth clutch and caregivers. Each thri-kreen accepts its place among its clutch mates and the greater pack. The primal instinct runs deep, linking the race to its ancestral history and the spirit world.",
					"Lore",
					"The thri-kreen wander the deserts and savannas of the Athas, avoiding all other races. Thri-kreen employ a language without words. To show emotion and reaction, a thri-kreen clacks its mandibles and waves its antennae, giving other thri-kreen a sense of what it is thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this manner of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. When forced to interact with creatures of other intelligent species, thri-kreen employ alternative methods of communication, such as drawing pictures in sand or making pictures out of twigs or blades of grass.",
					"Thri-kreen experience the full range of emotions but aren't as prone to emotional outbursts as humans. Thri-kreen with psionic ability often demonstrate a wider range of emotions, particularly if they live near or interact with humans or other highly emotional creatures.",
					"Thri-kreen consider all other living creatures as potential nourishment, and they love the taste of elf flesh in particular. If a creature might be useful for something other than food, the thrikreen aren't likely to attack it on sight. Thri-kreen kill to survive, never for sport.",
					"Thri-kreen don't require sleep and can rest while remaining alert and performing light tasks. Their inability to sleep is thought to be the reason why thrikreen have such short lifespans, the average thri-kreen life expectancy being only thirty years.",
					"Thri-kreen bond with their clutch mates and greater pack. This cohesion amplifies their hunting and fighting prowess. Thri-kreen prefer to hunt nonsentient creatures, but they make exceptions in desperate times. They do not fight for vengeance; rather, they safeguard their freedom and attack only when threatened. Thri-kreen who stray from this norm are often under the influence of malevolent creatures or spirits.",
					"Shamanistic desert talkers lead the thri-kreen in rituals to connect with ancestral spirits. Each thri-kreen taps into the race's memory. Some ancient memories reveal that the thri-kreen once held a powerful empire of their own.",
					"邂逅",
					"Thri-kreen packs roam the wilds. For centuries, slavers have trailed thri-kreen and stolen eggs. Newborn thri-kreen fetch a high price because they'll bond with their primary caregiver and clutch mates, regardless of race. Generations of thri-kreen have been integrated into city-states in this way.",
					"Info",
					"The thri-kreen religious life is centered on the harmony of the clutch with its environment. As such they respect life and never hunt or sport or considerer a life worthless. Spirit Guide will often lead a tribe of thri-kreen or become the keeper of places they consider sacred, such as oasis, mudflat or a portion of the desert. As most druid they will send warning sign of their presence to those crossing their territory, informing them that this land is under their protection and that every abuse will be severely punished. When facing danger the spirit guide will use his animal allies to protect his brethren and buff himself before changing into the most appropriate elemental form."

Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them. Wights are unscrupulous about allies, although a habit of the creature's living existence might influence its associations.

					"The red zezir is a ruthless desert predator that loves the sight of an open, uncontrolled flame. Red zezirs live to start and spread fires, reveling in the crackle and play of something, anything, as it burns. Red zezir packs have been known to attack merchant caravans and set them alight, retreating beyond the range of retaliation to cavort in joy as the entire caravan goes up in smoke. The creatures feed on ash, and their seeming infatuation with fi re provides them with sustenance. However, their love of fire also stems from their chaotic nature and an innate love of destruction.",
					"Male and female zezirs participate in hunts equally, and packs share the responsibility of raising the young. Red zezirs can communicate by means of a sequence of yips, growls, and whines. Zezirs are not reptilian, although they have some reptilian traits. They are more closely related to avians. A typical zezir stands between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs around 150 pounds.",
					"邂逅",
					"Zezirs are fast and agile, but not particularly stealthy. A pack typically posts a lookout near the site of a possible ambush, while the rest of the creatures lie in wait several hundred feet away. Once possible prey is spotted, the zezir scout returns to report the size and direction of the target. The pack then heads off at a run to intercept. Once they reach their objective, the zezirs run through and by their targets. The first zezirs of the pack spray their opponents with their sticky flammable spray, and the following zezirs use their spark stream attack to set the very air on fire. The zezirs often retreat to a safe distance to watch the burning, repeating the tactics if necessary."

Once they reach their objective, the zezirs run through and by their targets.

					"Blue zezir are larger cousins of the red zezir. They live mostly in mountainous areas where they hunt smaller preys and compete for food with wyverns. Their favorite meal include tarek, aarakocra or baazrag. Blue zezir usually hunt in duo, choosing a mate for life. Every few month the couple of zezir is migrating to new hunting ground when food is getting scare. They are direct hunter once the hunt is on, but make clever use of their natural hunting abilities. They wait in ambush, adopting the tone of the general surrounding to hide their presence and use their capacity to imitate sounds to lure preys. Once they have designated a target, they stick to it, ganging up on it and ignoring other distractions."

Still, they can be quite patient and wait in high grass where they can easily hide with their chameleon carapace.
