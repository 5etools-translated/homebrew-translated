									"正如他们秃鹫般的外表所暗示的那样，新魔王被发现在沙漠和平原上的可怕的黑暗仪式中吞噬腐肉和血祭。他们创造亡灵的能力使他们特别受到吸血鬼、食尸鬼和其他智能亡灵的欢迎，而他们的飞行和变形能力使他们成为邪恶军队的常见侦察兵。下面的例子取自米德加德的设定（尽管也适用于其他地方）。",
									"{@b For the Blood Goddess.}红色女神玛瑞娜似乎很喜欢新人类，虽然主要是作为寺庙的仆人和瘟疫的携带者。众所周知，这些恶魔住在她的大教堂的钟楼里，创造出类似于鹳鸟巢的骨巢（从远处看）。作为恶魔，骨巢里从来没有蛋，但却有大量的圆形、蛋状的头骨。在某些情况下，一对neophron恶魔可能会带着一个女祭司在天空中迅速地从一个地方到另一个地方，以达到某些不神圣的目的。",
									"{@b The Twelve Horse Bargain.}虽然马匹会觉得neophron的存在令人不安，但Khazzaki国王和半人马首领长期以来一直与恶魔进行交易，以换取12匹马或一整群其他动物的血祭。这是一笔不小的血肉之躯，但新人马在黑暗中侦察的能力使那些雇用它们的人在突袭、奇袭，甚至是军队的全面冲突中占据了上风。这种仪式被称为邪恶的仪式，游牧民族尽可能避免召唤。那些采用这种仪式的领导人总是有些可疑。",
									"{@b In the Ghoul Empire.}令人惊讶的是，尼奥龙恶魔在食尸鬼的地下茁壮成长，他们经常在那里为达拉库尔贵族、邪恶的大祭司和其他知名人士充当保镖。他们的黑暗视觉使他们能够以极快的速度沿着地下通道飞行，追踪并经常超越小股的德鲁突击队、哥布林商人或其他地下世界的旅行者。",
									"{@b In Desert Oases.}Neophron与{@creature Gypsosphinx|ToB|gypsosphinxes}({@loader Tome of Beasts|creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json})在沙漠地区工作，充当生物的侦察员和间谍。他们作为塞特和阿努-阿克玛（Anu Akma）的寺庙和宗教场所的守护者，在地下世界的神灵中活动。当一个{@creature Herald of Undeath|CCodex|herald of undeath}接近的时候，neophron的叫声会很响亮，这往往是附近的人对预言家接近的唯一警告。",
									"{@b The Throne of Bone.}在一个致力于肉体、骨骼和痛苦的外太空，新人类正在建造一个由骨头和软骨组成的巨大王座，被血染红，周围是由活人和不死生物组成的大教堂。据说，一个与新人类有关的生物将登上王座，俯瞰整个宇宙，并承担起神的衣钵。"

									"While yek demons usually choose their own masters, they are among the most mercenary of demons and can be bargained with to a greater degree than most. An evil spellcaster can perform a yek summoning ritual (its details shared among malign warlords and wizards) offering \"blood and bone and a stream of rich and constant plunder\" to the demons' pack leader, in exchange for service against a particular foe. If the plunder and cartloads of bone are not forthcoming (as, for instance, when a foe withdraws from the battlefield), the yek demons invariably take their fee out of their summoner or that summoner's troops and followers.",
									"This practice sometimes spreads to merely rapacious and opportunistic armies seeking an edge. For instance, in a controversial move, the armies of the Dragon Empire have begun using yek as shock troops, summoning the fiends behind enemy lines and letting them do the dirty work."

					"Once, a lesser-devil named Belphegor ruled a spit of Hell known as the Plane of Openings. There, the devil oversaw great chasms that appeared each morning in the thick blood-clay; chasms filled daily with the excrement of the denizens of Hell. Belphegor and his minions sealed the chasms at day's end, and thusly were the bodily wastes of Hell returned to its unhallowed ground. Though he did as was commanded by the Lords of Hell, the stooped and wretched devil desired power and rank. He began to conceive of ways to reduce the labor of his task. He built a great contraption from the bones of the damned to perform his toilsome task in his stead and named it Prime. Belphegor hoped it would impress his master, who might deliver him from his menial work.",
					"Before he could share his invention, Belphegor became entranced by Prime. Lost in its gears of bone, the devil soon forgot the original purpose of the invention. He continued building intricate parts that seemed like strokes of genius but, in reality, performed no useful function. The Plane of Openings overran with the bilious excrement of the planes of Hell, and soon the stench sank to the lowest pits, befouling the nose of his master. When he arrived to rend the delinquent devil into pieces as punishment for abandoning the task, the Arch-Devil saw Belphegor's machine and smiled wickedly. Through the busywork of self-indulgent invention, Belphegor had managed to produce nothing on a never-before seen scale. Belphegor was immediately made a lieutenant and given domain over tempting brilliant mortals into fruitless ingenuity and invention. He rides upon Prime as his infernal mount, its endless complexities whirring as he passes.",
					"In Hell, Belphegor is a massive, bent humanoid. His face is covered in small, horned protrusions, and his eyes are two endless spiralling voids. In combat, he wields a great flail whose head is held in place by a chain of damned humanoids. The sides of Prime are decorated with the useless inventions of mortals he has corrupted. On the Material Plane, he appears as a wizened, old man who carries a pack filled with tinkerer's tools. His symbol is a laborer's hammer with a shattered head.",

Prolonged exposure to the environment near a wasteland dragon's lair may lead to mutations and even madness, though the latter often passes once the sufferer is taken from the area.",
							"Clever creatures, wasteland dragons often make some use of the arcane items they find, seeing no hypocrisy in doing so; after all, they are hardly as foolish as humans! The approach to the creature's lair might be protected by strange energy fields, or weakened barriers between this world and another, or by creatures of the wastes who are smart enough to otherwise avoid annoying the dragon. The dragon confronted in its lair might forego its general inclination to attack immediately in favor of luring the intruders into such traps."

											"Hundreds of years ago, the Archmage of Vael Turog escaped the destruction his nation suffered in the Mage Wars and made his way far to the east, where he found a mountain at the site of the conjunction of two powerful ley lines. Located on the southern border of the tsar of Vidim's lands, this mountain was filled with dark and demonic energies and had been considered a blight on the map in the tsar's estimation. The archmage was offered dominion over the mountain if he could tame it and end the threats that issued from it. He summoned and bound a demonic legion, brought the mountain under his control, and staked his claim. The tsar, unaware and uninterested in the details, was delighted, and the archmage became known as the Master of Demon Mountain.",
											"He raised a castle there overnight, called Castle Dontrona, and there he has ruled for so long that the people of the surrounding plains have largely forgotten his name. Out of fear or dread of drawing his attention, they refer to him as \"the Master\" when occasion demands they speak of him at all.",
											"Since coming to the mountain, the Master's spells and incantations carry greater potency. The demons praise him, and he has mated with more than a few. The pacts the Master swore to gain power over the mountain and its creatures, however, are not the endless font of power that he had hoped. Indeed, he rarely leaves the mountain, and his children suspect he does not truly command it. Instead, the mountain commands him to bring it reagents and perform certain rituals, as demanded by demonic messengers, dreams, or priests of Chernobog.",
											"His lust for power drives him to ally with the Bemmeans, to offer arcana to the Dragon Empire, and to seek the hand of the tsar's comely daughters. His depravity simmers beneath an affected veneer of civility. In distant courts, the Master is known by the name he used in Vael Turog: Roggero Lucar Ordontrona, or sometimes an even older name, Gardever the Archmage of Vael Turog. He claims to be the last living scion of the noble bloodline of Vael Turog. Whether true or an empty boast, he acts the part and then some."

Darkvision can't penetrate the darkness, no natural light can illuminate it, no sound can be created within or pass through it, and any creature or object entirely inside the sphere of dark silence is immune to thunder damage. Creatures entirely inside the darkness are {@condition deafened} and can't cast spells that include a verbal component. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is destroyed."

The glories of combat do not blind them to their duties under the laws of war. War chaplains are also necessarily well-versed in a broad range of funeral rites and practices, for their faithful soldiers often follow more than one tradition."
