								"If some {@filter artes|spells|school=AR|subschool=!Grand} don't quite fit your campaign or if a PC wants to use them but none of them feel appropriate, then it's easy to adapt them by changing their names and damage type. Because cold, fire, and lightning are among the most-resisted damage types in the Monster Manual, they should generally be given the highest damage dice. The exception is if an arte already deals weapon damage, in which case it should have a low damage die, such as d4 or d6. It's rare for monsters to resist force, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage, so they should have medium to low damage dice.",
								"Artes are also relatively flavour-neutral and I encourage anyone implementing them to add their own flavour or change an arte's name. For example, if a barbarian character learned {@spell Parting Blaze|Artes}, the arte's fire damage could be described as a beastly claw made of flame that follows their weapon when they strike.",
								"You can add extra flavour not just by renaming artes, but also by grouping them by style, damage type, or function. For example, perhaps movement-centric artes (like {@spell Storm Dance|Artes} and {@spell Parting Blaze|Artes}) were created by an elite infantry unit, or all lightning-based artes (such as {@spell Lightning Lure|Artes}, {@spell Second Surge|Artes}, and {@spell Storm Dance|Artes}) were developed by an order of warrior-priests who worship a storm deity, or all defensive artes ({@spell Blade Ward|Artes}, {@spell Booming Blade|Artes}, {@spell Flames of Punishment|Artes}, and {@spell Sword as Shield|Artes}, for example) belong to the signature style of a certain kingdom's royal guards."

						"Q: Who is this for?",
						"A: Mechanically, martial cantrips / artes are for DMs who want to give the players of martial characters more options in battle aside from just using regular attacks over and over again.",
						"Q: What about the weeaboo fightan magic flavour?",
						"A: Flavour-wise, it's for people who want to give martials more spice than 'normal guy with weapon and armour' -- that flavour could come from the heroes of real-world mythology (such as Cadmus, Bhishma, Beowulf, Roland, Cu Roi, Arash, Bedivere, Diomedes, and others), by video games and Japanese animation, by Chinese wuxia fiction, and many other sources of inspiration.",
						"Q: I am a boring person who can't get it up unless my wizard elf game with monsters and magic takes place in a perfect recreation of historical Europe. Will you make mundane, non-magical versions of these special just for me, specifically?",
						"A: No. If you want mundane non-magical versions of these martial cantrips, then make them yourself. Changing the damage types, flavour, and names of the existing artes to fit your tastes should be easy for you, since people like you have a lot of experience sucking the fun out of things.",
						"Q: Are these considered magic, and therefore subject to rules regarding antimagic?",
						"A: Only if it suits your game. The default assumption is that they operate on the same logic (being a type of magic) as other martial cantrips, such as {@spell Booming Blade|TCE}, {@spell Green-Flame Blade|TCE}, and {@spell Sword Burst|TCE}. If explaining these as ki instead of magic makes more sense for your setting, then do that instead.",
						"Q: Isn't this overpowered?",
						"A: Not only is it not overpowered, it's barely regular powered. Cantrip damage does increase overall damage output, but not by a significant amount, and none of these effects are especially gamebreaking. Their effects were modeled after existing cantrips, which are balanced around repeated use in consecutive rounds.",
						"Q: but muh game balance",
						"A: D&D 5e is already a grossly unbalanced game that heavily favours casters. At the levels that casters are opening rifts to other planes of existence, calling down lightning, transforming into elementals, creating undead, petrifying their foes, and controlling minds, a martial is attacking a third time, dealing one more die of damage on sneak attacks or smites, or getting access to spells that full casters had eight levels ago.",
						"I promise letting martials use cantrips and cantrip-equivalents as part of their attack actions isn't going to break your game, it's just going to let the players of martial characters have more fun in battle."
