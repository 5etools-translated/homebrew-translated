							"These devious changelings can alter their appearance at will to almost any person, from human to dwarf, tiefling and beyond. In their true forms they appear as tall, grey humanoids with circular red eyes, no mouth and ears reminiscent of elves. In these true forms their skin is gelatinous to the touch, and they have slim, frail looking builds\u2014yet even this is misleading to their advantage, for a doppelganger is tough and agile no matter what guise they take.",
							"Doppelgangers possess the rare ability to peer into the minds of those around them, focusing on an individual and reading their surface thoughts. They use this to ability to learn as much as they can about their intended target before attempting to assume their identity. They will stalk their targets for hours, days or even weeks, observing their mannerisms and secretly stealing their name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories.",

							"As a result of their abilities, doppelgangers are often lazy and happy to live off the profits of prior schemes in luxury. This even extends to raising their young, preferring instead to assume an attractive male form and impregnate a female of almost any race, then leaving them to raise their own progeny. A child of this union seems to be a normal member of the mother's race until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is impelled find more of its own kind.",
							"Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups. When working together they each play specific roles in carefully crafted plots to part people from their wealth and valuables. Despite this, most doppelgangers are neutral rather than evil, acting out of extreme self-interest rather than any wish to harm the victims of their cons. Doppelgangers which fall to evil tend to murder rich targets and assume their lavish lifestyles, and potentially use this person's influence to extort the weak for greater profit.",
							"Good-aligned doppelgangers are the rarest kind, rarely able to mix openly with any race but their own out of widespread fear, revulsion and suspicion of their kind\u2014even the most pure of heart will struggle to accept a revealed doppelganger, always suspecting them of reading their mind, and potentially coming to impersonate them after more closely studying them. Those who try frequently find themselves suffering escalating paranoia.",
							"Forced to mix openly with only with their own kind, their mutually deceptive abilities see them encourage each other to lead lives of avarice.",
							"Doppelgangers rarely become adventurers, preferring to avoid the perils of fighting monsters and other such dangers. Those that do become adventurers may do so out of desperation or boredom, but usually only bother if it will help them complete a large-scale scheme. Occasionally a doppelganger may come to sympathize with the goals of a well-meaning group when impersonating someone among them for long enough."
