The language is complex and almost impossible to speak with a human mouth, as mothfolk speak with a specialized organ in their throat that other beings lack. Ivathi sounds like a series of squishes, clicks, and chitters, cut with the occasional thrumming or soft vowel. It uses its own alphabet, and translating it to other scripts only results in an approximation of the language's true sound.If you know Ivathi, you can also communicate very simple ideas to moths, and understand similar ideas from moths that choose to share them with you."

The fact that their multicolored wings tend to be emblazoned with beautiful, intricate patterns helps in this as well."
