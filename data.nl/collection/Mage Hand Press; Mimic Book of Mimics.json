						"Greetings, dear reader, and welcome to the {@i Mimic Book of Mimics}. In this tome, I have compiled all manner of mimicry and chameleonism belonging to the apex ambush predator of dungeons: the humble mimic. In its pages, you can find all which is known of mimickind to the realms of science, from its diet, to its hunting tactics, to its idiosyncrasies.",
						"Sadly, the anatomy and ecology of the common mimic are not yet widely understood. Many people do not know, for example, if the mechanism of the mimic's infamous shapeshifting is more akin to the transforming curse of lycanthropy, or the rigid-yet-oozelike humors of the gelatinous cube. Therefore, through countless hours of research, I have not only derived answers to these long unanswered questions, I have also uncovered numerous varieties of the common mimic, which hunt in elaborate and prices ways. To this book, I dedicate all this knowledge, for the betterment of scientific endeavour.",
						"There are detractors, however, who would claim that this book is nothing more than a mimic in disguise, waiting for you to lower your guard for even a moment to strike down upon your delectable hands. I cannot stress this enough: this book is not secretly a mimic, just as I\u2014Guyle Notasham\u2014am not a literary device employed by said mimic to make the illusion that much more complete.",

						"Few monsters are as emblematic to dungeon delving as the mimic. As a fluid shapeshifter, capable of replicating any dungeon fixture, the mimic is as much a part of dungeon architecture as it is dungeon ecology. Experienced adventures know that literally anything could be a mimic, but in accordance with the unspoken laws of dungeoneering, mimics only show up at the least convenient moment possible. Most often, this is when the party is exhausted and ready to claim whatever rewards hide in an old wooden chest.",
						"But mimics can be more than chests filled with treasure! They come in all shapes and sizes, from the diminutive {@creature mock|mimicbook} to the gargantuan {@creature bluff|mimicbook}. They can replicate treasure ranging from a single gold piece, to a painting, to a shiny new sword, and they can even pretend to be people, on occasion. Mimics should never be underestimated.",

								"Dungeon ecosystems produce some of the most astonishing creatures on the planet, which in turn become integral parts of their remarkable environment. Each dungeon denizen, from {@creature rust monster|mm|rust monsters} to {@creature blink dog|mm|blink dogs}, has their own unique biology, diet, and life cycle, which defines them among their peers. Mimics are no exception; as some of the strangest monstrosities native to dungeons, they live truly bizarre lives.",

										"The mimic earns its name from its uncanny ability to not only alter the shape and color of its body, but the texture of its skin as well. In an instant, a mimic can contort its entire form to perfect replicate an inanimate object, only to remain motionless for hours, if not days. Few limitations hinder mimic transformation, as long as the intended form possesses the same volume as the mimic itself, and has no complex moving components.",
										"These uncanny changes owe largely to a special layer in the mimic's skin, containing innumerable, microscopic pigmentation organs. These organs are responsible for pumping pigment to the skin's surface to be seen, for drawing pigment deeper into the body to hide it, and also for producing new pigmentation compounds to match materials found in the environment. The mimic's skin even possesses a rudimentary memory, allowing it to rapidly reshape its form into commonly assumed colors and textures once disturbed.",
										"Once a mimic's skin is transformed, it remains that way passively, requiring no internal energy until the mimic transforms again. Because of this, {@homebrew no one|nooone} has ever seen a mimic in a fully un-transformed state\u2014their amorphous state still resembling a melted or distorted object. Even after death, the limp, pliant body of a mimic retains its color and texture.",
										"Moreover, a mimic's anatomy is fundamentally fluid. Though mimics are not internally homogenous (as oozes are), mimics possess malleable organs, which seem akin to putty when examined post-mortem. Most of these organs operate on fundamentally unexplained mechanisms. Some strengthen to grant rigidity to the mimic's frame for extended transformations, others digest prey, and others still transform into the mimic's characteristic eyespots, teeth, and purple, acidic surfaces."

										"Mimics have evolved to assume the façade of whatever furnishings naturally exist in their hunting grounds, and gravitate toward forms which attract prey. Most adventurers assume this means mimics will always disguise themselves as treasure, but mimics are just as likely to take the form of archways, sconces, doors, and staircases. Such forms are akin to a snake stalking a well-trafficked game trail: prey walks by often, and are likely to ignore small details on their commute.",
										"Mimics are nothing if not patient. The more intelligent of the species will slumber inanimate until their prey is alone or vulnerable, whereas the more aggressive will simply linger until their prey wanders within reach. But be warned: less trafficked dungeons always have hungrier, more aggressive mimics.",
										"When a mimic finally reveals itself, it bears its teeth and pseudopods, ensnaring and ripping into prey that have drawn too close. To the unprepared, a mimic ambush is a death-sentence, for it's nigh impossible to squirm away from the mimic's adhesive skin before its teeth deliver a lethal blow. In a perfect kill, after a momentary struggle, a mimic leaves only shoes behind where a person once stood. Of course, with a weapon at hand and vigilant allies, most anyone can stand a fighting chance.",
										"Unless starving, a mimic will always retreat before being slain. Wary adventurers should make every effort to slay a fleeing mimic before it escapes from view, for once it gets out of sight, a deadly cat-and-mouse game ensues. The injured mimic could be anywhere or anything, and it knows to be cleverer each time it stages an ambush. The adventurers are more suspicious of each object that seems out of place. Perhaps the mimic assumes the form of an uncommon object, or perhaps that's just what the adventurers will expect next!"

Adventurers are too few and far between\u2014and too many are already eaten by dragons each year\u2014to be a sustainable food supply. Indeed, mimics mainly subsist on other dungeon delvers. {@creature goblin|mm|Goblins}, {@creature kobold|mm|kobolds}, {@creature drow}, {@creature giant rat|mm|giant rats}, {@creature grimlock|mm|grimlocks}, {@creature lizardfolk}, and {@creature rust monster|mm|rust monsters} are all on the menu, while the occasional unwary {@creature bat} will make a fine snack. Mimics are simply not picky about food, but will always prefer a larger humanoid meal.",

										"All mimics, regardless of subspecies, reproduce by fission: when a mimic grows large enough and has a surplus of food, it asexually divides into two independent mimics. Ooze research has done much to enlighten the mechanism behind this process, but it still possesses a handful of enigmas.",
										"The largest and most perplexing of these is the supposed \"prime\" mimic form, the shape assumed by new mimics the moment they are birthed. Natural philosophers assume that mimics, like all other shapeshifters, have a natural un-transformed form, which is assumed by them only in the moments before they assume their first object form. From that moment onward, they shift between analogs of objects, and never fully revert to this hypothetical state. Sadly, reproduction of captive mimics has never been observed, so the question of this \"prime\" mimic form for now remains unverified.",

										"Innumerable histories trace the mimic's origin to a lesser-known wizard, mad tyrant, or sorcerer-king, who constructed the creature from vile magics long ago. Upon close investigation, however, it would seem that all these stories are apocryphal, for they all derive from a single source. The original text did not even cite their origins, but instead drew metaphor to a mythological figure, Ahad the Mad (a demigod who crafted furniture from his worshippers), to explain their remarkable powers over shapeshifting. Later histories embellished this reference into entire fictional kingdoms and wars to explain the mimic's origins and a mage's intervention. Thus, with this amateur historian's extensive efforts, we are now no closer to understanding the mimic's origins!",
										"You would be justified, then, in asking from whence these monstrosities arise. Such a unique creature, after all, ought to have a unique history. Mimics are an age-old monstrosity, but don't trace their ancestry to the dawn of time. Indeed, the earliest histories describe relatively simpler transformations and fewer varieties of the creature.",
										"Therefore, I believe there are a few strong possibilities for the mimic's origin. I begrudgingly accept that it's possible a defective {@spell polymorph} spell might have distorted a magical creature into the first mimic, but such tampering always proves ruinous in practice, usually resulting in inside-out hybrids, rather than hyper-adaptive mimics. It's also possible that the meddling of a god spawned the first mimic (it might have even been the mythological Ahad the Mad), but no god known today has outright engineered a monstrosity of such complexity, save for a few varieties of appalling undead.",
										"The final, and most curious possibility, is that mimics simply evolved from early oozes, or a similarly amorphous ancestor. Despite how miraculous mimic shapeshifting might seem, it's indicative of a trait honed by natural selection to perfectly fit a specific environment\u2014albeit, of a magical creature in an utterly unique environment. Mimic hunting works best in dark, static, claustrophobic environments, within which they can trick and corner prey. Their ambush tactics are remarkably energy-efficient, allowing them to flourish in environments with sparse wildlife. Lastly, while mimics possess surprising canny, their instincts fail outside of their dungeon habitats, meaning most surfaceborne mimics starve or become a meal rather soon. Such magical natural selection might be an explanation for other monstrosities as well, such as the {@creature darkmantle} and {@creature phase spider}, but that would be a topic for another tome."

					"Savvy adventurers know that the real money in dungeoneering isn't in finding piles of hard currency, like gold or silver, but is instead in raiding fine works of art and objects of masterwork craftsmanship.

Of course, savvy mimics have caught onto this trend, and have chosen to replicate paintings and tapestries to ensnare adventurers of finer taste. These mimics are called acrylicks, and generally look indistinguishable from normal paintings at a glance. However, if inspected closely, it might be possible to catch the painting's eyes following you as you turn your back on it.",

					"{@creature fraudsword|mimicbook|Fraudswords} are a scourge of adventurers everywhere, for if there's three things wayward adventurers hope to find in a dungeon, it's gold, nobles in distress, and shiny new weapons. Alas, when a brave knight goes to retrieve their new axe, spear, or claymore, they might be surprised to find it bearing teething upon its blade and eyes on its hilt! Fraudswords can assume the shape of any item, but choose melee weapons for their lethality and propensity to draw in prey. Naturally, due to their chosen form, fraudswords are an especially dangerous breed of mimic, capable of slashing and hacking at ensnared prey.",
					"Of course, fraudswords are but one of a handful of mimics which duplicate small items. Its closest relatives are the {@creature bowgus|mimicbook}, a mimic that replicates bows, crossbows, and other ranged weapons, and the fool plate, which pretends to be a suit of armor, before digesting anyone foolish enough to wear it.",
					"Such mimics aren't as canny as their larger relatives, but can be trained if fed a steady diet of meat. A pet fraudsword is a truly flexible weapon, capable of transforming from a greataxe into a spear with a flick of the wrist. However, it is still a beast; if mistreated or underfed, it will turn on its wielder in the blink of an eye."
