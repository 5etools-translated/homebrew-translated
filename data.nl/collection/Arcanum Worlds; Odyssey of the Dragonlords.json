					"Marmeren golems worden meestal gebeeldhouwd om te lijken op prachtige helden en heersers uit vervlogen tijden. De tovenaars die ze bouwen vereisen de diensten van grote ambachtslieden, omdat de gelaatstrekken van de golem zeer levensecht moeten zijn, wil de bezielende magie aanslaan. Er gaan geruchten dat kwade tovenaars hun toevlucht nemen tot het verstenen van mooie jongeren om de materialen te krijgen die ze nodig hebben voor de bouw.",
					"Esthetische Bewakers. Marmeren golems worden gewoonlijk ingezet om gebieden te bewaken waar esthetische schoonheid gewenst is - tempels, paleizen, bibliotheken, of landgoederen. Marmeren golems kunnen vermomd zijn als normale standbeelden, maar ze komen tot leven onder bepaalde omstandigheden. Ze kunnen bijvoorbeeld indringers aanvallen die een kamer binnenkomen zonder het juiste wachtwoord in te spreken. Ze kunnen ook geactiveerd worden op een commando van hun aangewezen meester.",
					"Narcistische geesten. Marmeren golems worden bezield door geesten die uit de elementaire werelden worden geplukt en met geweld in kunstmatige lichamen worden gebonden. De geesten die onbewust worden aangetrokken tot deze bijzondere constructies zijn altijd ijdel, en golem-bouwers maken gebruik van hun verwaande aard wanneer ze de nodige bindingsspreuken weven. Zolang de geest zijn nieuwe vorm en omgeving mooi vindt, is de kans veel kleiner dat hij zich aan de controle van zijn meester zal onttrekken. Er wordt dan ook veel zorg aan besteed om de marmeren golems zo uit te stallen dat hun schoonheid wordt benadrukt en gerespecteerd.",
					"Meedogenloze Achtervolging. Een marmeren golem stopt gewoonlijk zijn aanvallen als een vijand is gevlucht. Echter, als de marmeren golem zijn schoonheid is ontsierd, zal de geest binnenin woedend worden. De golem zal meedogenloos worden in zijn verlangen om degene die hem heeft beschadigd op te sporen en te doden. Hoewel de golem geen magische krachten heeft om het voorwerp van zijn haat op te sporen, kan hij wel voetafdrukken volgen en zal hij iedereen die hem in de weg staat ondervragen (of vernietigen)."

					"De cyclopen zijn een oerras van reuzen die afstammen van goddelijke wezens. Hun oude voorouders waren grote soldaten, smeden en bouwers.

Zij kunnen variëren in grootte, in intellect, en in het aantal armen of vingers dat zij hebben, maar één kenmerk is altijd hetzelfde: één groot oog onder hun voorhoofd, in plaats van twee.",
					"Afstammend van goden. Cyclopen hebben het bloed van goden in hun aderen. Empyreanen zijn de meest voorkomende voorouders van de cyclopen, hoewel sommige cyclopen kunnen beweren de kinderen te zijn van een mindere god die in een ver verleden de sterfelijke wereld bezocht.",
					"Verloren doel. De cyclopen hadden vroeger een groter doel: het smeden van wapens voor gebruik door de goden; het bewaken van grote schatkluizen gevuld met doemswapens; of het bouwen van massieve forten, torens, en andere wonderbaarlijke architectuur. Deze grote taken zijn al lang verlaten of vergeten.",
					"Verliefdheid. Cyclopen worden vaak verliefd op leden van de fey rassen. Deze verliefdheid is gedoemd te eindigen in een tragedie, want de fey zien cyclopen als lelijke bruten. Het beste waarop een cycloop kan hopen is om een dienaar te worden, om gebruikt en gemanipuleerd te worden.",
					"Wapens en pantser. De meeste cyclopen dragen slecht passende kledij en barbaarse wapens, maar anderen hebben meer geluk. Deze cyclopen dragen fijn gemaakte wapens en harnassen die door een machtige beschermheer werden geleverd.",
					"Cyclopen met superieure uitrusting",
					"Een cycloop met een krachtige beschermheer draagt splint mail, een schild en een oorlogshamer. Deze cyclopen hebben AC 19. Bijzonder machtige cyclopen kunnen slagstokken hanteren die bij elke aanval 29 (6d6 +8) schade toebrengen.",
					"Blemys",
					"Blemys zijn cyclopen die geen hoofd hebben. In plaats daarvan hebben zij één groot cyclopisch oog, samen met een neus en een mond, in het midden van hun borstkas. De Blemys zijn vervloekte cyclopen die alleen leven, gevuld met woede en bitterheid. Hun sudderende woede kookt vaak over tijdens het gevecht, waardoor zij een nog angstaanjagender vijand worden.",
					"Iets te bewijzen. Ondanks hun bijna komisch uiterlijk, zijn ze geduchte vijanden. Onderschatting van hun capaciteiten kan leiden tot een vroegtijdige dood. Een Blemys die geen respect krijgt van zwakkere wezens zal zijn reusachtige kracht tonen door zulke respectloze vijanden uit elkaar te scheuren. Van blemys wordt vaak aangenomen dat ze niet intelligent zijn omdat ze geen hersenpan hebben, en veel niet-blemys denken ten onrechte dat ze letterlijk hersenloos zijn. In feite zijn Blemys de meest intelligente cyclopsoort. Zij kunnen de gemiddelde sterfelijke kolonist te slim af zijn, net zoals zij in het verleden hun beschaafde neven, de gygans, te slim af waren. De beste strategie om een conflict met een Blemys te vermijden, is hem uit te dagen tot een gevecht van verstand. De blemys laten winnen en dan om genade smeken, kan vleiend genoeg zijn om het leven van de verliezer te sparen. Als een blemys wordt verslagen door een duidelijk superieur intellect, zal zijn vernedering hem waarschijnlijk in een vlaag van woede doen aanvallen. In dergelijke situaties kunnen tegenstanders voordeel halen uit het beperkte gezichtsveld van de blemys. Als een behendig en oplettend individu het extreme tunnelzicht van de blemys lang genoeg ontwijkt, kan hij ervan overtuigd raken dat zijn prooi is ontsnapt en in tranen van frustratie zijn zoektocht opgeven.",
					"Nomadische levensstijl. De stekelige persoonlijkheid en asociale neigingen van Blemys weerhouden deze wezens ervan gemeenschappen te vormen. Ze leven van het plunderen van slecht verdedigde nederzettingen voor voedsel en andere goederen, en als ze de kans krijgen kunnen ze zelfs stelen van hun eigen soortgenoten. Als gevolg daarvan zwerven Blemys vaak alleen rond, omdat ze snel uit een gebied worden verdreven als de overlevenden van hun rooftochten zich herstellen en organiseren.",
					"Onzekere oorsprong. De oorsprong van deze bizarre cyclopen is onbekend. Sommige geleerden geloven dat hun toestand een goddelijke vloek is. De voorouders van Blemys kunnen een beschaving zijn geweest van bijzonder intelligente, charismatische en sociale cyclopen die ongewoon neigden naar ijdelheid. Dit, mogelijk gecombineerd met de niet-religieuze aard van de meeste cyclopen, trok de aandacht van wrede goden die beslisten hen te straffen voor hun trots en narcisme. Beroofd van hun mooie uiterlijk en rijkdom, stortte de beschaving van de Blemys snel in en dreven hun nakomelingen naar een eenzaam leven van eeuwige ontevredenheid."

					"Gygans zijn zesarmige reuzen met een enkel oog. Het gerucht gaat dat zij afstammen van een oud cyclopisch ras dat door de goden werd voortgebracht en duizenden jaren geleden floreerde. Hun beschaving van stadstaten concurreerde in grote spelcompetities met de nadruk op boksen en worstelen. Soms ontaardden deze spelen in regelrechte oorlogsvoering. Met het verval van hun eens zo grote beschaving, leven de gygans nu samen in kleine familiegroepen of soms alleen.",

In plaats van een stadstaat die bestaat uit één grote metropool en het omliggende gebied, vormen de gygans van vandaag groepen rond een machtige familie. Een gygagemeenschap begint met een groot stichtend familielandgoed dat in de loop der tijd wordt opgebouwd, en dat eenzame gygans en partners uit andere familiegroepen aantrekt. Deze nieuwkomers bouwen hun eigen huizen in de buurt, waardoor er tussen de landgoederen stukken relatief veilig landbouwland ontstaan. Gygans binnen deze familiegroepen werken samen om voedsel, wijn, kleding, kunst en amusement te produceren. Deze zichzelf onderhoudende gemeenschappen hebben zelden contact met niet-gygans. Dientengevolge ontwikkelt elke geïsoleerde familiegroep een eigen cultuur die volledig verloren kan gaan als de gemeenschap door een ramp wordt getroffen. Sommige gyganfamilies zijn zo geïsoleerd geraakt dat hun leden dialecten spreken die niet verstaanbaar zijn voor andere sprekers van het reuzendialect of het reuzendialect, ook niet voor andere gygans in hetzelfde gebied.",
					"Superieure atleten. De zes armen van een Gygan geven hem een ongeëvenaarde atletische bekwaamheid. Zij combineren kracht met behendigheid en zijn geduchte krijgers door hun vermogen om meerdere wapens en schilden te gebruiken. Zij kunnen ook tegenstanders vastgrijpen met hun extra armen om hen vast te pinnen alvorens hen af te maken."

Sommige stervelingen verwarren de keledon met godinnen vanwege hun perfecte vormen en tijdloze onveranderlijkheid. Keledone hebben de neiging een serene houding te hebben. Ze laten zich niet afschrikken door zelfs de meest angstaanjagende bedreigingen.",
					"Betoverende Melodieën. Het grootste wapen van A Keledone is haar prachtige stem, die de kracht heeft om zowel rustgevende troost als beklemmende wanhoop op te roepen bij iedereen die haar hoort. Een van haar liederen haalt de meest trieste herinneringen van de luisteraar naar boven en intensiveert ze, wat de psyche van mensen met een minder sterke wil kan breken. Een andere melodie sust de agressors van een Keledoon in een diepe slaap. Afhankelijk van de ernst van de overtreding van haar slachtoffer, kan een keledoon haar slaapverwekkende lied lang genoeg voortzetten dat haar doelwit sterft van uitdroging. De keledonen gebruiken hun liederen echter niet alleen voor offensieve doeleinden; ze staan er ook om bekend kalmte en vrede te brengen in de geest van verontruste sterfelijke smekelingen.",
					"Hemelse Wachters. De keledonen zijn vaak belast met het beschermen van heilige plaatsen, zoals tempels, necropolen, en andere plaatsen die belangrijk zijn voor hun scheppers. Sommige zijn zelfs ingebouwd in de muren van hun bezittingen. In tegenstelling tot mindere automaten hebben keledonen geen onderhoud nodig om hun taken uit te voeren. Vele keledonen staan al millennia op wacht, volledig onaangetast door de tijd. Een keledoon kan de opdracht krijgen om indringers met dodelijk geweld op afstand te houden, terwijl anderen gewoon de veiligheid van hun mensen verzekeren. Sommige keledonen zijn belast met het testen van avonturiers, om ervoor te zorgen dat alleen de sterksten in staat zijn door te gaan om de kennis of de schat te vinden die zij zoeken.",
					"Mechanische wil. De keledon zijn intelligente constructies met een zelfbewustzijn dat zeldzaam is bij automaten. Hoewel het geen inherente eigenschap is, kunnen keledonen in de loop der eeuwen verschillende persoonlijkheden of identiteiten ontwikkelen. Dit fenomeen komt het meest voor bij keledonen die vaak in contact komen met andere wezens, of dat nu andere intelligente constructies, bovennatuurlijke wezens of gewone stervelingen zijn. Ondanks hun individualiteit is het uiterst zeldzaam dat een keledoon zich onttrekt aan haar plichten of haar post verlaat. Degenen die dat wel doen, merken dat de magie die hen in leven houdt, begint te vervagen. Een ontrouwe keledon verliest snel haar vermogen om te vliegen, omdat haar zware metalen vleugels het gewicht van haar massief gouden frame niet meer kunnen dragen."

					"Verwrongen van lichaam en geest, zouden de afzichtelijke gigantes een zielige vorm van reus zijn, ware het niet voor hun enorme wreedheid en bloeddorst. Gigantes voelen zich gedreven om elk intelligent wezen dat ze tegenkomen te doden, met uitzondering van andere gigantes - hoewel hun gewelddadige en losgeslagen aard betekent dat zelfs kleine meningsverschillen tussen gigantes meestal eindigen in bloedvergieten. Ondanks deze gebreken zijn gigantes allesbehalve domme bruten, en de gemiddelde gigantes is even intelligent als de gemiddelde mens. Dit, gecombineerd met hun grote kracht en grillig, onvoorspelbaar gedrag, maakt de gigantes tot een bijzonder gevaarlijke vijand.",
					"Verlaten creaties. De gigantes zijn oorspronkelijk gemaakt door de Titaan Hergeron. Hij wilde dat ze zijn meesterwerk zouden worden, maar ze werden onafgemaakt achtergelaten toen Hergeron gevangen werd genomen door zijn broer Sydon. Als de gigantes af waren geweest, zou hun kracht de grootste van alle reuzen zijn geweest. Een legende die onder de giganten wordt verteld, beweert dat als Hergeron ooit wordt vrijgelaten, hij zijn grote werk zal afmaken en alle stammen van de giganten zal veranderen in de perfecte krijgers.",
					"Corrupted Blood. One of the derangements of the gigantes is that their blood and saliva is poisonous to most other creatures. Thus the gigantes lick their spears before going into battle. They are also known to spit their poison at their enemies. Gigantes witches are able to use this spit to incite bloodlust in gigantes warriors.",
					"Perpetual War. Gigantes are hostile to all other races. They are self-destructive with little regard for even their own lives, and once a gigantes picks a fight it almost always battles to the death. Occasionally, gigantes tribes will work with minotaurs, as they feel some kinship to the cursed bull-headed humanoids.",
					"Social Structure. Although gigantes form social groups, these bands can hardly be called a \"community.\" Each loosely structured group is held together by two or three gigantes witches that claim to draw power from their sleeping god, Hergeron. Gigantes usually dwell in crudely built forts, often constructed in deep forests or high mountains. In Thylea, the most powerful gigantes tribes have been drawn to the lands surrounding the city of Aresia, making travel to and from the city an often deadly task.",

The gigantes witch and any other gigantes in the cone goes into a blood rage for 1 minute. During this time, a gigantes is immune to the charm and frightened conditions. If a gigantes is already charmed or frightened, the condition immediately ends. The gigantes gains advantage on all melee attacks and has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.",

Like many monstrous magical creatures, medusae become more formidable with age, as they gain in both raw power and the wisdom to master that power.

Its previous, weak humanoid body has been replaced with a massive snake-like torso, and its muscular, scaly arms possess strength rivaling a hill giant. The euryale's serpentine body can encircle and crush smaller creatures with ease. Barbed, venomous quills line the bodies of some euryales, and these quills can be detached and used as arrows to strike at foes that stand out of reach. Despite this grotesque bodily transformation, the euryale's face continues to be eternally young and beautiful, if somewhat unsettling. This ensures that the terms of the pact or \"boon\" that created the original medusa remains unbroken.",

The medusa may agree to perform specific tasks or pledge servitude to such a creature in exchange for its magic. In other cases, capricious beings may transform the medusa for no better reason than their own amusement, hoping to unleash chaos upon the Material Plane. The rare euryale that does not consent to this change often goes mad, leaving its lair to seek vengeance upon whichever unfortunate souls it happens to encounter."

As eusocial beings with a shared hive-mind intelligence, myrmekes maintain constant telepathic communication with all nearby fellows. This creates a network that can respond to distress calls across an expansive territory controlled by the myrmekes. Although not inherently malevolent, myrmekes are a significant threat to all other forms of life in any ecosystem they enter. Their industrious nature, instinct for aggressive expansion, rapacious consumption of resources, and rapid breeding makes the myrmekes incompatible with other creatures. Consequently, the gods imprisoned the myrmekes on a remote island not long after their creation. In addition to the physical barriers surrounding them, the myrmekes are also bound by powerful magic to ensure their eternal isolation. However, if this enchantment was ever broken, these creatures could swarm over every continent, remaking the entire world as an insectoid empire.",

Additionally, though they lack creativity, this gives myrmekes workers a genius-level intelligence rivaling that of even the most gifted humans."

Architects of wild beauty, nymphs are bound to, and protect, the forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains, and seas they shape and call home. Nymphs feel a greater kinship to elves than do most other fey, and the two groups resemble each other in general appearance, though nymphs have more obviously supernatural features.",
					"Enigmatic Values. All nymphs are incredibly beautiful and demand to be surrounded by aesthetically elegant creatures and items that rival their own appearance. They are chaotic beings that believe in the importance of beauty above all else. Rather than viewing the world in terms of good and evil, most nymphs see only beauty and ugliness. To them, actions that create beauty are laudable; beautiful creatures and objects must be protected. That which destroys or damages beauty, or promotes ugliness, must be eradicated.",
					"Secluded Surroundings. Nymphs make homes in the most beautiful locations of the natural world. They augment these places, nurturing the plants, shaping the earth, and purifying the water. Those seeking a nymph should look to the most breathtaking natural landmarks in their vicinity as a sign of her presence. However, intruders are rarely welcome, as most nymphs prefer to live in solitude. Many nymph homes lie on the borders between the fey and the mortal realm. Time passes differently in these locations, and mortals who unwittingly wander into a nymph's domain for an afternoon may find themselves displaced by centuries in time.",
					"Ephemeral Lovers. Many prominent heroes of legend are thought to be the offspring of nymphs. Affairs between nymphs and mortals tend to be fleeting and frequently end in tragedy. Powerful mortals who are seduced into joining nymphs in the fey realm may disappear from the mortal realm for centuries, throwing kingdoms into chaos in the meantime. Nymphs taken into the mortal world as wives and husbands soon pine for the natural splendor of their wild homes, and they usually abandon their mortal families.",

					"Nymphs may be male, female, both, or neither. However, most nymphs possess certain delicate feminine qualities, regardless of their gender, and they are collectively described with feminine pronouns.",
					"Nymph Lairs",
					"The lair of a nymph is a beautiful, natural place that reflects her type. For example, dryads make their lairs in the branches and roots of a great tree to which she is bound. Naiads often dwell within underwater caves that can only be reached by swimming beneath a river or lake. Oreads may choose picturesque ruins located high in the mountain that she calls home. When a nymph's lair contains a connection to the fey, or lies within the fey, she gains access to lair actions.",
					"Lair Actions",

					"Regional Effects",
					"The region containing a nymph's lair is warped by the ephemeral nature of the feywild.",
					"• Time passes differently in the lair of the nymph. Every day spent there counts as a month in the mortal world. The nymph can decrease this rate of time passage to a week or increase it to a year.",
					"• Monstrosities, aberrations, fiends, and humanoids with Charisma scores of 8 or less feel extremely uncomfortable in a nymph's lair. They have disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.",
					"Aurae",
					"Aurea are nymphs associated with the sea and the night sky, currents, breezes, and the constellations. Each aurae claims an island for her home, and she guards it with fearsome devotion. The most territorial of the nymphs, aurae have taken it upon themselves to stem the tide of civilization and do not tolerate mortals on their islands. They are not malicious or cruel, and they always give trespassers fair warning to leave. But if their words go unheeded, they will not hesitate to smite interlopers with all their power.",
					"Aurae sometimes become muses for mortals. These nymphs have an innate fascination with words and language, and thrill in the abilities of poets, storytellers, and lyricists. Some of history's greatest songs, poems, and tales are thought to have been inspired by aurae.",
					"Like other nymphs, aurae can charm others to fight for them, but they also wield great strength, both physical and magical. In battle, aurae weave fey magic into beautiful songs to lull their opponents to sleep and to inflict psychic harm through vivid nightmares."

Naiads also serve as muses to great artists and musicians, taking them to a level of creativity that only supernatural assistance can inspire. Thanks to these abilities, powerful mortals frequently fall in love with naiads, and they are the most likely of all nymphs to give birth to mortal children with grand destinies."

Although quick swimmers in their own right, nereids often seek the aid of dolphin or seahorse mounts to bolster their effectiveness in battle. Nereids are as attached to such creatures as paladins are to their steeds; should the animal fall in battle, its rider may be overcome by grief. Each nereid wields her own personal trident, which is grown from the same coral they protect. Although they are dangerous when threatened, nereid sightings are considered to be a portent of good luck for sailors. Wise captains know to steer clear of their reefs, so as to avoid damaging them with the ship's anchor. In addition to their skill as warriors, nereids are also well known for their exquisite voices, which can travel through water undistorted. Unlike the songs of many other aquatic fey, nereids do not weave enchantments into their music; they sing for beauty's sake.",
					"Benthic Beauties. Nereids are sometimes mistaken for merfolk at first glance. They possess streamlined, slightly alien features that are as striking as they are beautiful. Diaphanous webbing connects the fingers and toes of a nereid, and their slick skin resembles that of a dolphin, albeit in various shades of blue and green. Some nereids have additional fish-like traits, such as visible gills and fins that run along their limbs and back, though this aspect of their anatomy is highly variable, depending on their tribe.",
					"Guiding the Lost. Many nereids display a level of benevolence towards humanoids that is rare among fey. Nereids have been known to shepherd lost sailors safely back to civilization, provided that they show adequate respect for nature. Some nereids even establish long-term relationships with the sailors who frequent their waters, steering their ships away from the sea's many hidden dangers.",
					"Defenders of Reefs. Nereids are bound to protect a specific coral reef, just as dryads are bound to their forests. Overtly hostile nereids are rare, and they usually do not discourage the intrusion of mortals into their domains. However, visitors should be wary to not mistake their relatively kind natures for softness; should their homes be at all harmed or threatened, nereids retaliate en-masse with a piranha-like tenacity, giving no quarter to their prey."

					"NYMPHS",
					"Nymphs are powerful fey who embody the splendor of the natural world. Architects of wild beauty, nymphs are bound to, and protect, the forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains, and seas they shape and call home. Nymphs feel a greater kinship to elves than do most other fey, and the two groups resemble each other in general appearance, though nymphs have more obviously supernatural features.",
					"Enigmatic Values. All nymphs are incredibly beautiful and demand to be surrounded by aesthetically elegant creatures and items that rival their own appearance. They are chaotic beings that believe in the importance of beauty above all else. Rather than viewing the world in terms of good and evil, most nymphs see only beauty and ugliness. To them, actions that create beauty are laudable; beautiful creatures and objects must be protected. That which destroys or damages beauty, or promotes ugliness, must be eradicated.",
					"Secluded Surroundings. Nymphs make homes in the most beautiful locations of the natural world. They augment these places, nurturing the plants, shaping the earth, and purifying the water. Those seeking a nymph should look to the most breathtaking natural landmarks in their vicinity as a sign of her presence. However, intruders are rarely welcome, as most nymphs prefer to live in solitude. Many nymph homes lie on the borders between the fey and the mortal realm. Time passes differently in these locations, and mortals who unwittingly wander into a nymph's domain for an afternoon may find themselves displaced by centuries in time.",
					"Ephemeral Lovers. Many prominent heroes of legend are thought to be the offspring of nymphs. Affairs between nymphs and mortals tend to be fleeting and frequently end in tragedy. Powerful mortals who are seduced into joining nymphs in the fey realm may disappear from the mortal realm for centuries, throwing kingdoms into chaos in the meantime. Nymphs taken into the mortal world as wives and husbands soon pine for the natural splendor of their wild homes, and they usually abandon their mortal families.",
					"Types of Nymphs",
					"Nymphs are divided into six subraces: dryads of the forests, naiads of lakes and rivers, nereids of the oceans, oreads of the mountains, oceanids of the islands, and aurae of the night sky.",
					"Nymphs may be male, female, both, or neither. However, most nymphs possess certain delicate feminine qualities, regardless of their gender, and they are collectively described with feminine pronouns.",
					"Nymph Lairs",
					"The lair of a nymph is a beautiful, natural place that reflects her type. For example, dryads make their lairs in the branches and roots of a great tree to which she is bound. Naiads often dwell within underwater caves that can only be reached by swimming beneath a river or lake. Oreads may choose picturesque ruins located high in the mountain that she calls home. When a nymph's lair contains a connection to the fey, or lies within the fey, she gains access to lair actions.",
					"Lair Actions",
					"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nymph can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:",
					"• The nymph glimpses the future, so that it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.",
					"• The nymph merges with her surroundings and reappears anywhere in her lair. This ability functions exactly like dimension door except that it requires no components and the range is limited to within the nymph's lair.",
					"Regional Effects",
					"The region containing a nymph's lair is warped by the ephemeral nature of the feywild.",
					"• Time passes differently in the lair of the nymph. Every day spent there counts as a month in the mortal world. The nymph can decrease this rate of time passage to a week or increase it to a year.",
					"• Monstrosities, aberrations, fiends, and humanoids with Charisma scores of 8 or less feel extremely uncomfortable in a nymph's lair. They have disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.",
					"Oceanid",
					"Oceanids are a type of fey who travel the coasts, often bringing music and merriment in their wake. They are most well known for their fascination with humanoids and largely take on forms that mimic handsome male members of these races. Oceanids adore beauty of all kinds but personally lack subtlety. They are invariably flashy, dressing in brightly-colored clothing and heavily adorning themselves in jewelry.",
					"Mutable Shapes. Oceanids are shapeshifters who typically take forms that are almost physically indistinguishable from male humanoids. An oceanid rarely assumes a single guise for more than a month or two at a time, but he may revisit an identity later on. Many bear minor tells that go largely unnoticed, such as too-green eyes or sweat that smells too closely of ocean brine. Though they may lack \"true forms,\" oceanids sometimes also appear as creatures akin to water elementals, albeit in a closer approximation of human shape.",
					"Tricksters of the Shore. Oceanids spend much of their time tricking and playing pranks upon mortals. These tricks are usually harmless, but they can be infuriating. A common example of an oceanid prank is to exchange jewelry for other valuable trinkets\u2014items that soon crumble into sand once the oceanid takes his leave. However, some oceanid pranks can turn fatal, often in the form of drownings. In another favorite oceanid prank, the oceanid lures his target into dangerous currents with illusory calm waters. Although some oceanids are indeed malicious, any deaths resulting from their pranks are usually unintentional. Oceanids can be poor judges of mortal swimming ability and lead victims to their dooms in their ignorance. When such a fate befalls an object of an oceanid's affections, he may become so overcome with grief that he dissolves into seafoam.",
					"Consummate Musicians. Like many fey creatures, oceanids have a fondness for music and are skilled players of lutes, lyres, and other stringed instruments. Many oceanids delight in sharing their expertise with humanoids, and their pupils often go on to become famous bards. Although not always a means of enchantment, some oceanids use their songs to magically attract mortals to the shore. Such lures are often necessary, as oceanids begin to lose their mental faculties if they stray too far inland. However, their intentions for doing so vary: one oceanid may simply want an audience, while another may seek to draw in new victims for his pranks."

					"With an appearance that treads the line between the comedic and horrific, the ichthys is a twisted centaur-like creature with a humanoid upper body that protrudes from the shell of a massive crab. This monster is the result of a cruel curse bestowed by the gods upon merfolk and other aquatic humanoids, usually as punishment for severe transgressions. As a result of their loathsome origins, most merfolk look upon ichthyses with utter disgust, and the creatures become outcast from merfolk societies. Doomed to aimlessly wander the seafloor, the ichthys becomes consumed by the desire to search for victims as outlets for its unrelenting pain and anger The only joys it knows are those of torture and senseless bloodshed. Most ichthyses continue to wield the same weapons they did before their transformation. Hence, the creatures tend to favor tridents and other implements used by merfolk.",
					"Tortured Forms. An ichthys's body is racked with perpetual pain, and any attempts at quick movement are especially agonizing. This state is a product of the strain put upon crustacean anatomy that is not designed to support heavy humanoid torsos. Despite its incompatible physiologies, the body of an ichthys continues to function by way of the curse's magic. Pain and poor balance create a plodding, awkward gait paired with a relatively slow swimming speed.",
					"Macabre Artists. Although largely nomadic, ichthyses set up temporary camps on the seafloor. There, an ichthys uses the bodies of its victims as bait to draw the attentions of both food and other humanoids. An ichthys arranges these corpses to create grotesque sculpture gardens. It often begins to \"sculpt\" its subjects when they are still alive, tying them in place before further carving into their flesh. An ichthys will sometimes leave a victim half dead, as their feeble attempts at escape make for an excellent lure."

Some legends claim that Scylla was once a beautiful nymph who was imprisoned on Typhon for countless years. Over time, its corruption slowly twisted her body and mind into the monstrosity she is today. By the time she was strong enough to break free of her bonds, any semblance of the nymph she was had long been replaced by hunger and madness."

					"Sometimes called Gloom Hounds or Hounds of Hades, these three-headed creatures are bred to be the ultimate guardians. Very few creatures can successfully sneak past a cerebus hound that guards a doorway or treasure. Tortured by Hags. Hags train these creatures through abuse designed to instill fear and rage. No hound in their charge is ever shown affection, and they are kept either in total isolation or attached to chains too short to allow the pups to comfort each other. Large groups of cerberus hounds are sometimes given very little food, in order to identify weaker dogs for culling. The hags then sew shut the mouths of the runts and encourage their former packmates to devour them. The hags also present the hounds with captive humanoids, bound and mutilated, in order to give them a taste for blood.",
					"Progenitors of Death Dogs. Cerebus hounds can spawn litters of death dogs. They will only do this if there is enough food to satiate the hunger of all the hounds. The death dogs acknowledge the cerebus as the pack alpha. Whenever a cerebus dies, the death dogs fight for primacy. The victor devours the losers, and over the course of a month, it grows a new head, becoming a new cerebus to replace the original.",
					"Fearsome Guardians. Cerberus hounds take pride in sniffing out and devouring trespassers. Once they have been set to guard something, they never tire of their charge, even should hundreds of years pass without incident. Most hounds keep piles of their victims' bones as beloved trophies to gnaw on.

A single dread boar can devour entire fields of crops and herds of livestock in a matter of hours. If left unchecked and allowed to encroach upon humanoid settlements, a dread boar makes short work of all available food stores, leaving the residents to starve. Lutheria sometimes personally sends these creatures to plague prosperous cities she believes have not offered her adequate sacrifices."

In the most common ritual, innocent young women are tricked or forced into consuming the flesh of a loved one. Others have become maenads after prayers to cure a dying loved one were cruelly answered. One particularly sadistic method of creating a maenad is to charm a victim and force her to beat a loved one to death with a fennel staff.

These unions lead to the production of monstrous goatling offspring, who are as disliked as their mothers because of their relative weakness and connection to mortals. Maenads are especially abhorrent to non-evil fey due to the depraved and gruesome rituals that create them.",

Though eager to engage in any type of revelry, some maenads may have a preferred indulgence, such as food or wine. Clever individuals who find themselves confronted by maenads may be able to use their individual tastes to turn the creatures against each other. That might allow for an escape.

Closer inspection, however, reveals a creature that could not possibly be mistaken as such. The nuckle resembles a rotting corpse with its humanoid lower torso fused to the back of an equine form that makes up the majority of the creature's body. A single oversized eye stares out from the center of the nuckle's bulbous head, and it grasps at its victims with clawed hands attached to spindly, too-long arms. However, the most noteworthy aspect of the nuckle may be its raw pink flesh, which evokes the appearance of person who has been severely burned or flayed alive.",

Although the sea is the creature's true home, the nuckle regularly rises from the depths to plague coastal cities and towns, bringing death and misfortune in its wake. A nuckle's preferred manner of attack is to grab a victim and drag them into the sea on its back in a manner that makes the victim appear to be riding into the water on horseback. The nuckle may disappear beneath the waves for years at a time, only to rise and wreak havoc during a months-long rampage.",

This toxic cloud threatens all forms of life, wilting crops and sickening livestock. Animals that survive the nuckle's poisonous breath are often driven mad and compelled to dash themselves upon rocky cliffs or drown themselves in the sea.",
					"Cleansing Water. As formidable as the nuckle is, the monster does have its weaknesses. Chief among these is large amounts of pure fresh water. If the nuckle is drenched with enough fresh water, its body swells up and bursts, destroying the creature. To protect itself, the nuckle uses its magic to cause devastating droughts. However, this ability weakens the farther it strays from the sea. Brave heroes wishing to vanquish a nuckle often lure it as far inland as possible by burning seaweed. The stench of the resulting smoke has the power to enrage the nuckle to the point where it abandons all sense of self-preservation, as it is driven to find the source. Strong caution should be taken when using this strategy, however, as it is prone to backfiring; the nuckle destroys any settlements unfortunate enough to exist between it and the target of its fury."

Architects of wild beauty, nymphs are bound to, and protect, the forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains, and seas they shape and call home. Nymphs feel a greater kinship to elves than do most other fey, and the two groups resemble each other in general appearance, though nymphs have more obviously supernatural features.",
					"Enigmatic Values. All nymphs are incredibly beautiful and demand to be surrounded by aesthetically elegant creatures and items that rival their own appearance. They are chaotic beings that believe in the importance of beauty above all else. Rather than viewing the world in terms of good and evil, most nymphs see only beauty and ugliness. To them, actions that create beauty are laudable; beautiful creatures and objects must be protected. That which destroys or damages beauty, or promotes ugliness, must be eradicated.",
					"Secluded Surroundings. Nymphs make homes in the most beautiful locations of the natural world. They augment these places, nurturing the plants, shaping the earth, and purifying the water. Those seeking a nymph should look to the most breathtaking natural landmarks in their vicinity as a sign of her presence. However, intruders are rarely welcome, as most nymphs prefer to live in solitude. Many nymph homes lie on the borders between the fey and the mortal realm. Time passes differently in these locations, and mortals who unwittingly wander into a nymph's domain for an afternoon may find themselves displaced by centuries in time.",
					"Ephemeral Lovers. Many prominent heroes of legend are thought to be the offspring of nymphs. Affairs between nymphs and mortals tend to be fleeting and frequently end in tragedy. Powerful mortals who are seduced into joining nymphs in the fey realm may disappear from the mortal realm for centuries, throwing kingdoms into chaos in the meantime. Nymphs taken into the mortal world as wives and husbands soon pine for the natural splendor of their wild homes, and they usually abandon their mortal families.",
					"Types of Nymphs",
					"Nymphs are divided into six subraces: dryads of the forests, naiads of lakes and rivers, nereids of the oceans, oreads of the mountains, oceanids of the islands, and aurae of the night sky.",
					"Nymphs may be male, female, both, or neither. However, most nymphs possess certain delicate feminine qualities, regardless of their gender, and they are collectively described with feminine pronouns.",
					"Nymph Lairs",
					"The lair of a nymph is a beautiful, natural place that reflects her type. For example, dryads make their lairs in the branches and roots of a great tree to which she is bound. Naiads often dwell within underwater caves that can only be reached by swimming beneath a river or lake. Oreads may choose picturesque ruins located high in the mountain that she calls home. When a nymph's lair contains a connection to the fey, or lies within the fey, she gains access to lair actions.",
					"Lair Actions",
					"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nymph can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:",
					"• The nymph glimpses the future, so that it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.",
					"• The nymph merges with her surroundings and reappears anywhere in her lair. This ability functions exactly like dimension door except that it requires no components and the range is limited to within the nymph's lair.",
					"Regional Effects",
					"The region containing a nymph's lair is warped by the ephemeral nature of the feywild.",
					"• Time passes differently in the lair of the nymph. Every day spent there counts as a month in the mortal world. The nymph can decrease this rate of time passage to a week or increase it to a year.",
					"• Monstrosities, aberrations, fiends, and humanoids with Charisma scores of 8 or less feel extremely uncomfortable in a nymph's lair. They have disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.",
					"Oread",
					"As the most airy of the nymphs, in demeanor and their chosen domains, oreads are reclusive creatures associated with mountains, skies, and clouds. They are mischievous and selfish, even by fey standards, and one of their favorite pastimes is to take a mortal lover to \"paradise.\" The lover is only returned to the mortal realm a century or more later, once their families and friends are all dead and gone. This is not always deliberate on the part of the oread\u2014they simply don't give very much thought to the consequences of their actions on the lives of the mortals they beguile.",
					"Fey Hunters. Strangely, unlike dryads and most other fey creatures, oreads are consummate hunters. Mortals with exceptional hunting skills are not punished for killing animals on an oread's land, and may even be rewarded with a boon to improve their prowess. However, oreads take offense at mortal hunters who lack finesse. They are known to transform poor or needlessly cruel hunters into game animals as retribution for sullying their territory.",
					"Territorial and Possessive. Oreads are by far the most territorial of all nymphs. They may suffer mortal trespassers in their lands for a time, but always with the understanding that their sovereignty over that land must be honored and reaffirmed. They expect visiting mortals to make offerings of food and wine at shrines along the roads\u2014failing to do so many provoke the oread into hunting trespassers as game. Additionally, if an oread takes a romantic interest in a mortal who passes through his territory, he may claim that mortal as his \"pet.\""
