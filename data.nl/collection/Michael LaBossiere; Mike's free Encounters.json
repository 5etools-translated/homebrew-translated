A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the wine has signs of necromantic magic. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Alchemist's Supplies) check as part of an analysis of the wine will reveal it contains poison and some other elements. An {@spell identify|PHB} spell will reveal its true nature.",

On a failed save, you take 6 ({@damage 1d12}) poison damage and are Poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, you take half damage and are not Poisoned.",
				"If you die within 24 hours of drinking zombie wine, your corpse animates as an uncontrolled zombie. Zombie wine is believed to have been first distilled by a priest of Durakor who was a vintner before his conversion."
