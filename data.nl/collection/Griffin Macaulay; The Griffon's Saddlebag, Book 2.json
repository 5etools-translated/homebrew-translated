A creature gains one level of drunkenness whenever it has a number of alcoholic drinks within 1 hour equal to 2 + half its Constitution modifier, rounded up (a minimum of 2 drinks per hour).",

The kinds of rolls that suffer these penalties, as well as other effects of drunkenness, are shown in the table below.",

Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, a creature may need to drink additional alcohol to gain levels of drunkenness as a result of building up a natural tolerance from drinking it frequently over time.",

On a success, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. When it does, the creature loses 1 level of drunkenness. The DC for this saving throw increases by 5 each time the creature repeats the save before it loses all of its levels of drunkenness.",

At the center of the watch is a secondary dial with a small, skeletal hand that indicates the amount of hit points you have remaining. If you die while the watch is on your person, the watch reverses your personal time stream just long enough to keep you alive, returning you to life with 1 hit point and allowing you to immediately stand up. When the watch reverses time in this way, one of the watch's three glass panes cracks and can't be repaired by mundane or magical means. For each pane of cracked glass, there is a cumulative {@chance 25|25 percent} chance that the watch fails to reverse time when you die. When all three panes of glass are cracked, the watch becomes nonmagical, although it can still be used to tell the time."

The door appears and opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the {@spell knock|PHB} spell and similar magic, such as that of a {@item chime of opening|DMG}. The door opens to reveal a tunnel 15 feet deep and lined with ladder-like rungs made of twisting roots. At the bottom of the tunnel is a large, circular room that's 30 feet in diameter with 10-foot-high ceilings. The room is brightly lit by bioluminescent fungi that grow along its wooden walls and ceiling. You can magically control the light in the room by touching the luminous fungi, allowing you to fill the room with total darkness, dim light, or bright light.",
				"A single hallway leads away from the room. Four doors line the hallway, which each lead to a room that's 10 feet in diameter with a 10-foot-high ceiling. Every room is decorated with various pieces of wooden furniture made from coiled roots and other magically occurring plant growth, such as tables, chairs, or a bed, depending on the needs of the creature who planted the root.",
				"At the end of the hallway hangs a single red root. You can use a bonus action to pull the root to cause the hallway to extend upward into a tunnel, complete with a root-like ladder, and create a second, temporary entrance to the dwelling in an unoccupied space 60 feet away from the entrance stump. The temporary entrance is well-hidden, noticeable only with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, and remains until the start of your next turn.",
				"A creature that casts the {@spell plant growth} spell as an action can redesign the appearance and furniture in one of the dwelling's rooms. If the spell is cast over the course of 8 hours, the creature can redesign the appearance and furniture of the entire dwelling instead, except for the location of the entrance stump. A conscious druid or ranger inside the dwelling is aware of any Small or larger creature that comes within 60 feet of the dwelling's entrance, and magically knows only the creature's size and gait, such as the gallop of a horse or walk of a humanoid.",
				"The entrance stump has 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a {@spell plant growth} spell cast on the stump can repair it, with each casting restoring 10 hit points to it, or all its hit points if cast over the course of 8 hours. If the stump is destroyed, the dwelling collapses and magically shunts anything inside it (other than the furniture) to the nearest unoccupied space next to where the root was buried. When this happens, the earth magically returns to the way it was before the root was buried."

				"The typical {@item shifter's shine|GriffonsSaddlebag2}, a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes your face to appear more glamorous. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, your skin's complexion clears, appears healthier, and grows more taut. Your face, while largely unchanged, is distinctly more attractive and exudes a weak aura of enchantment magic. When you make a Charisma check while under the effects of this potion, you can choose to forgo rolling the {@dice d20} to get a 10 on the die. Once you use this property, you can't use it again for the remainder of the potion's duration. The potion is a rich honey color and swirls lazily around, regardless of how it's handled. It can be found in any sort of vessel, though it is usually found in glass jars. The eye of a shapeshifter drifts along the potion's bottom, making it a daunting beverage for the average taverngoer to order. It has an extremely strong alcoholic taste with a hint of caramel. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.",

While the wings remain outstretched, you fall at a rate of 10 feet per round and gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which you can use to glide horizontally as you descend so long as you hold onto the shield. If you land on the ground while falling in this way, you take no damage from falling. You can't {@action Dash} while using the shield to fly, and this flying speed can't be increased in any way. You can use the shield to gain altitude when flying in this way, but must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot you fly upward. The wings refold immediately if you land or at the end of your turn if you didn't fly at least 15 feet on that turn."

When a skeleton suspended in an ooze is subjected to necromancy that would normally transform it into a mindless thrall, it's possible for the ooze to magically connect to the reanimated body, and its departed life, instead. This event is called Synthesis, and it's through this process that the fragments of life held by ooze and skeleton can come together to form a complete whole.

The memories from any of their previous lives are lost in this process, but can resurface in pieces through hazy dreams or waves of déjà vu.",

				"The wand has a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) with which to cast the imbued cantrips (0 charges), 1st-level spells (1 charge), or 2nd-level spells (2 charges). A creature holding the wand can use an action to cast one of the spells from it using your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability. The wand ceases to be magical the next time you finish a long rest."

On the count of three, both players use their d20 to reveal the total value of their roll by placing the result face up on the die. The player with the lowest value wins the round, causing the other player to roll a {@dice d6} and gain a number of points equal to the number rolled. A player loses once they have 10 or more points.

At the GM's discretion, this drunkenness can be measured in six levels using the following rules. A creature gains one level of drunkenness whenever it has a number of alcoholic drinks within 1 hour equal to 2 + half its Constitution modifier, rounded up (a minimum of 2 drinks per hour).",

However, the creature also suffers a penalty to certain rolls equal to its drunkenness level. The kinds of rolls that suffer these penalties, as well as other effects of drunkenness, are shown in the table below.",

A creature that has resistance to poison damage or has advantage on saving throws against poison must drink twice the amount of alcohol as normal to gain one level of drunkenness. A creature immune to poison damage or the {@condition poisoned} condition can't become drunk against their will. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, a creature may need to drink additional alcohol to gain levels of drunkenness as a result of building up a natural tolerance from drinking it frequently over time.",

On a success, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. When it does, the creature loses 1 level of drunkenness. The DC for this saving throw increases by 5 each time the creature repeats the save before it loses all of its levels of drunkenness.",

Finishing a long rest removes any levels of drunkenness unless the creature fell {@condition unconscious} for the duration of the rest as a result of suffering level 6 drunkenness. In that case, the creature loses {@dice 1d4} + 2 levels of drunkenness instead and doesn't regain Hit Dice as a result of finishing a long rest."
