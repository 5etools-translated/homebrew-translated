				"Paladins who vow the Oath of Ash seek to preserve the longevity of civilization, dedicating every resource at their disposal to securing future prosperity. Paladins sworn to this oath believe that progress is not automatic nor inevitable, but a journey where each step demands sacrifice, struggle, and suffering. To them, only those with unbreakable focus and determination can wield the brilliant torch of progress. These paladins achieve this by cauterizing the detrimental aspects of civilization with their calamitous power, purging it of its imperfections. The salvation they seek is the knowledge that their labors will help bring about a new dawn for civilization.",

You can also pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks.
