In this case, if you do succeed in finding the emerald, it is guaranteed that you will meet this willing archfey. Divine beings are not necessarily omniscient, so if your deity does not know exactly how to respond without being misleading, or if a scenario is too easily changeable, they will reply with \"unsure\" and the spell ends. For example, asking your deity whether you will find true love one day may be met with \"unsure\" as a response.",

The more unlikely a prophecy is to be fulfilled, or the more extreme a goal is, the harder it is to find the key to success and the easier it is to fall for the foreboding omen. Only one prophecy can apply to a single creature at a time. If you attempt to request for a second prophecy before the first one is fulfilled on the same creature, your spell slot will be consumed and nothing happens. Once either the prophecy is fulfilled or if the DM decides it is not possible for the key to be found (the emerald is disintegrated in the previous example), the spell ends, the creature is made aware, and a new prophecy can now be applied.",
						"Casting this spell requires your deity to come up with a difficult answer as to not mislead you, and so you may or may not receive your prophecy immediately. If your deity responds immediately, the green smoke above the cauldron will display your prophecy to you visually, and maybe audibly. If not, then during the creature's next long rest, it will be visited by the god in its dreams, and it will receive it then. Attempting to cast prophecy again in the time before you or the creature receives an answer will force you to lose your spell slot without any effect."

As the column retracts upwards, a glowing runic symbol relating to the deity that facilitated the spell's casting appears in the burnt crater that the light created.

The symbol emits dim light out to 20 feet, and any creature not of a good alignment that enters the 10-foot area for the first time on their turn or starts its turn there takes 50 radiant damage.
