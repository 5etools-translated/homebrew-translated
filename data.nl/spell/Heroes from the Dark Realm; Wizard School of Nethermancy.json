				"Nethermancy was created when wizards fled to Shadowfell hundreds of years ago and searched through the plane's many secrets. The original nethermancers found shadow magic as the reason for the Shadowfell's creation. The strength of shadow magic derives from the dark energy that the primordials rejected when they first gave form to substance. Nethermancers focus on pulling raw shadow from their environment and then forcing it into arcane forces to create magical effects.",
