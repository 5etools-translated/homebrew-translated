										"Ans. Within the rules, very little. A party could assist in many ways to help a jouster get crowd support and they can provide healing between Jousts. However.... If a party was prepared to break the rules there are many ways in which they could cheat to help the party. Spellcasters can use their magic to boost the chances of their friend and sabotage their rivals (EG: by casting Hex on an opponent's Wisdom). Rogues could poison an opponent's horse or cut their saddle.  Of course if a party was prepared to do this then out there a jouster may find that an opponent might be prepared to use such underhand tricks too... "

When a PC has an additional attack, this gives an additional jousting dice not an extra attack roll each tilt. We would suggest you try to keep to a single attack roll for each tilt and try to reflect the benefit of class features in other ways.",

We wouldn't disallow this but would want a good reason by a PC why their God would support this."
