Maye that level 9 true polymorph tattoo needs the blood of a great red dragon. That's going to make getting a large back piece a bit more difficult than walking into the corner tattoo shop.",
										"Above all, I encourage creativity and fun. Let your players have fun coming up with ways to boost their characters with new found powers, because what's more fun that a Frost Giant ambushing your party, a two headed Frost Giant with a pack or starving Gnolls riding Wyverns :D looks like your party should have gotten a large fireball tattoo instead of a small one. Oh well, live and learn... or TPK"
