Het omvat ook dingen die indirect zijn gecreëerd door de onbegrijpelijke overlevering van de Ancients - mutanten en vleesvormende ongelukken, de nakomelingen van experimenten, enzovoorts.",

Als het uiteindelijk slecht gaat, worden de cyphers die deze limiet overschrijden vernietigd. Ernstiger gevolgen zijn een permanente vermindering van de fysieke stats van de PC als al hun cyphers samensmelten tot een brandende afvalhoop, een gruwelijke oorlogsmachine van de Ouden die spontaan op de locatie ontstaat, of het personage dat door een korte, kleine singulariteit wordt gezogen en onherstelbaar wordt vernietigd.",

Vanuit het oogpunt van de 21e eeuw betekent dit apparaten, machines, voertuigen, robots, computers, wapens, satellieten, drugs, enzovoort. Maar het betekent ook biotechnologische wezens, cybernetische wezens, en wezens die hier zijn gebracht van buitenaardse werelden in andere zonnestelsels, of dimensies buiten die welke gewoonlijk worden geacht deel uit te maken van de kosmologie. Met andere woorden, het is niet alleen high tech, maar ook apparaten die zelfs ons begrip van de 21e eeuw te boven gaan - dingen die tijd, ruimte, zwaartekracht en meer manipuleren.",
								"Het is echter belangrijk te onthouden dat de personages van de spelers niet naar de numenera kijken zoals mensen in de 21e eeuw naar technologie kijken. In een fantasiewereld zouden een krachtveldprojector en een radio met twee richtingen niet alleen magie lijken, maar magie van hetzelfde krachtniveau. De radio zou zelfs krachtiger kunnen lijken omdat het gebruik ervan breder is en de effecten \"onzichtbaar\" zijn. Personages met een middeleeuws gevoel hebben geen zicht op welke soorten technologie geavanceerder zijn dan andere, en zij nemen niets ervan als vanzelfsprekend aan.",
								"Hetzelfde geldt waarschijnlijk voor veel van de wezens die in {@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA} worden voorgesteld. Gewone mensen zullen waarschijnlijk denken dat de meeste van hen gewoon \"demonen\" zijn. PC avonturiers zullen waarschijnlijk anders te weten komen, maar de gemiddelde dorpeling, stadsbewoner, handelaar of bewaker in een fantasie omgeving heeft niet de kennis of het perspectief om te denken dat een ding van bijna 20 voet groot dat hongert naar vlees iets anders is dan een bovennatuurlijk beest van puur kwaad. Maar in werkelijkheid is dit ding - in dit geval een {@creature jiraskar|AotA} - geen demon in de planaire zin, maar een top roofdier, een van de vele die op de een of andere manier zijn meegevoerd uit de tijd van de Ouden. Ondanks hun grootte, zijn het dieren. Maar de gevaren die deze wezens vormen, maken de perceptie van een gewone burger begrijpelijk. Het concept van een demon - een geestelijk kwaadaardige entiteit - is een label voor bedreigingen die niet begrepen kunnen worden. Om alle wezens die hongerig zijn naar vlees en jagen op mensen over één kam te scheren als demonen is duidelijk simplistisch. Erger nog, dit berooft de lokale bevolking waarschijnlijk van mogelijke strategieën om met zo'n wezen om te gaan. Met een dier kan worden afgerekend. Maar een demon?",

Als actie kun je bijvoorbeeld een licht voorwerp optillen en naar je toe trekken, of een zwaar voorwerp (zoals een meubelstuk) een halve meter verplaatsen.

Je kunt deze mutatie niet gebruiken om je eigen lichaam te bewegen of iets wat je vasthoudt of draagt. De kracht duurt een uur.

Je krijgt deze hit points terug met een snelheid van {@dice 1d8} per ronde, en je moet elke ronde je actie gebruiken en geconcentreerd blijven; als je onderbroken wordt, stopt de genezing. Het apparaat wordt volledig leeggezogen, zelfs als je onderbroken wordt voordat je klaar bent (de GM mag zelf bepalen of een voorwerp nog wat lading behoudt of alleen een depletion roll hoeft te maken als het gedeeltelijk leeggezogen is).
