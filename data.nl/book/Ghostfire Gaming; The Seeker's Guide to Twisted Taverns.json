De sporen van deze reizende taverne kunnen door een willekeurig aantal locaties lopen die passen bij je campagne - bovengronds en ondergronds, tussen steden en dorpen, door het platteland, over de bergen, of langs de kust. Het spoor kan rond zijn voor een oneindige lus om je terug te brengen naar waar je begon, of een reis van eind tot eind met avontuur onderweg. Als een variant op het gebruik van dit boek kan de Rail-Away dienen als een cruiseschip dat alle andere tavernes in volgorde aandoet.",
						"De avonturen op de Rail-Away zijn bedoeld voor personages van niveau 5 tot 10. De taverne kan gespeeld worden als een tijdelijke locatie, die dient als een onderbreking van gevaarlijke avonturen. Je kunt ook de combinatie van quests en een moordmysterie spelen met behulp van de NPC's.",
						"Het is aan de GM om te bepalen hoe vaak de Rail-Away op stations stopt, maar sommige quests vereisen minstens een dag reistijd tussen de stops om de spelers de tijd te geven om op avontuur te gaan. Stops kunnen ook worden veroorzaakt door tanken, passagiersovergangen, of het toevoegen van vrachtkarren.",
