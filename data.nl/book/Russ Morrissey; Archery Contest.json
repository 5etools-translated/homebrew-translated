						"Archery competitions are common competitive events. The rules are simple: competitors fire at a target and score points depending on how close to the center of the target the arrow strikes. The archer with the most points wins. A staple of medieval tournaments, the archery contest draws bowmen from far and wide to test their skill and accuracy.",
						"Contests can sometimes attract up fifty or more skilled competitors, and the winner often receives a valuable prize\u2014cash, jewellery or, more commonly, a fine bow or quiver of arrows. In traditional archery contests, contestants fire arrows at a stationary target, though some tournaments use moving targets or have the archers fire from horseback. Usually the target has different locations that are worth different points in a contest, though some contests simply require a contestant to hit the target at all to progress.",

								"These mechanics assume an archery contest whose target has different locations worth different amounts of points. Each archer gets a certain number of shots, usually one or three, and winners are determined by who gets the most points in either an elimination or round robin tournament. For each shot, the archer makes an attack roll, and his total attack roll determines how many points he gets. In the case of ties, the target is moved back 100 ft. per round thereafter that there is no winner.",
								"The first thing you, as the GM, need to do is determine how difficult this tournament is. If it's a simple village affair, the shots may be quite easy for seasoned adventurers; but a tournament involving the cream of a mighty empire might begin with very difficult targets\u2014and many more contestants!",
								"The table in this article shows the attack bonuses of the contestants at each round of a contest. The AC of the target at each contest level is the attack bonus of the competitors +10 (thus giving the average competitor at a given tier of the tournament a 50% chance to succeed). The attack bonuses at the final represent the best of the region, country, world - or even multiverse! You, as the GM, are free to adjust these numbers of course."

								"Orcs practice Punctureshot archery contests, where the goal is to shoot through several archery targets. Each target is a sheet of painted paper attached to a thin sheet of wood. The contestant doesn't get points based on the accuracy of the shot: instead, if the arrow hits, roll for damage. For every 5 points of damage, the arrow punctures one target and hits the next. Magical arrows are forbidden, but most orcs won't know the difference unless the arrows are obviously enchanted (the target takes energy damage, for example). For every target punctured, 1 point is earned. Sometimes, instead of archery targets, orcs line up prisoners of war. Assume it takes 10 points of damage to to puncture through a helpless torso."
