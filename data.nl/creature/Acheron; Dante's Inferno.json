When she has no specific errand, she stalks the corridors and the halls of the Blind Prisons, looking for any fool that may trespass in her dominion, whether they are damned, devils, or Lost Ones. In her dungeon, Medusa rules unchallenged and can tear to pieces and devour anyone. Her aspect is unknown, as those who have seen her face can no longer tell what they saw. She has vipers as hair and her hands end with bronze claws. To meet her gaze is certain death: your semblance will immediately turn into stone. Being a Traveler, your new semblance will soon appear next to the closest source of the divine flame, but you will lose part of your Hope. You must thus fight without ever letting Medusa get in your line of sight, or just fight blindfolded. You can see the gorgon without being petrified only through her reflections, so you can use a mirror or a liquid surface to detect her. Fortunately, there are more than enough barrels you can smash in the dungeon, to make a few reflecting pools. The infernal Medusa, though, will not sit idly by in the meanwhile."

						"When a creature that can see Medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of Medusa, Medusa can force it to make a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw if Medusa isn't {@condition incapacitated} and can see the crea-ture. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly {@condition petrified}. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is {@condition restrained}. The {@condition restrained} creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming {@condition petrified} on a failure (in this case, the Traveler is destroyed) or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If Medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, Medusa is, due to her curse, affected by her own gaze."
