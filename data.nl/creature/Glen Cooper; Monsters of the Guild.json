In addition, whenever a creature within 10 feet of the golem hits it with an attack, the shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage. The golems melee attacks also deal an extra 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage while this ability is active. This effect lasts up to 1 minute and requires concentration by the golem."

A beast that's all muscle, the drake stands three feet tall at the shoulders, grows to 12 feet from its nose to the end of its six-foot long tail end, and weighs up to 250 pounds. The drake is equally at home in mountains, forests, or the open plain. The hunting drake is a formidable foe, waiting to ambush from up high, ready to pounce down upon unsuspecting foes. Wise kobolds learned to domesticate the beasts as mounts, equipping them with special saddles that help the riders stay secure when the drake goes vertical and leaps horizontally."
