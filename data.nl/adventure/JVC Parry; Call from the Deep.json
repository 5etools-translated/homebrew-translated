						"You are about to set sail on an epic adventure that thrusts the heroes into the middle of a pirate-filled mystery. {@i Call from the Deep} is a {@i Dungeons & Dragons} 5th Edition campaign for four to six player characters. Players should start with 1st level characters and reach at least 10th level by the campaign's conclusion.",
						"The campaign takes place in the Forgotten Realms, specifically in a region known as the Sword Coast, on the western shore of Faerûn and the seas beyond. Nonetheless, you can easily adapt the adventure to your home campaign by changing the names of various locations and factions.",
						"I recommend that you read the entire campaign before attempting to run it. This introduction begins with an \"{@adventure Adventure Background|CallfromtheDeep|1|Adventure Background}\" section that summarizes the events that set the adventure in motion. The \"{@adventure Running the Adventure|CallfromtheDeep|1|Running the Adventure}\" section tells you everything you need to know to run the adventure smoothly.

The settlements on the coast and the Island Kingdoms of the Sea of Swords and Trackless Sea are the primary settings of this campaign, but other inland locations may feature more prominently during your playthrough. For additional information on these locations, consult the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}.",
								"The coastline itself is perilous and changeable. In the north is the Sea of Moving Ice, filled with great bergs that shatter the hulls of unwary ships. Further south lies calmer waters and friendly ports and cities, such as Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and Baldur's Gate. Despite the existence of these havens, Red Rocks isn't the only thing that will sink your vessel. Pirates from Luskan and The Northlander Isles roam the coast, targeting merchant galleys and bullying fishing boats. The seas too are cruel, harbouring hideous monsters, tempestuous squalls and unseen horrors in their depths.",

										"Entirely alien to most of the common folk of the Realms, the illithid, or mind flayers, formed an empire of psionic hive mind slavers who brought devastation to populations of sentient creatures. Over many centuries, and across innumerate worlds, these tentacled nightmares subjected thousands of races to psychic torture, breaking their will and turning them into thralls. Telepathically united, these aberrations traversed the Outer Planes in nautiloids, ships attuned to their needs, in search of races to enslave.",
										"One of these races were the gith. Although they were dominated for centuries by the illithid, somehow the gith revolted against their oppressors, overthrowing their empire and scattering the remaining mind flayers far and wide. Although the details of the uprising are unknown, the illithid and gith (who became two separate races, the githyanki and githzerai), still hold utter contempt for each other. The gith actively seek out Illithid to destroy, and mind flayers seek githyanki crèches on the Material Plane to subjugate and torture. For more information about the gith and illithid conflict, known as the Endless War, see {@book chapter 4 of Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|mtf|3}.",
										"In recent times, most surviving Illithid are scattered across the Astral Plane. A few made it to other worlds, where they continue to harvest brains and create thralls. Numerous sects of illithid have taken up home in the Underdark, the vast network of caverns beneath Faerûn. Here, hidden in the shadows, they devour the brains of sentient creatures to sustain themselves.",
										"Illithid culture is founded on knowledge and understanding. As well as consuming brains for sustenance, mind flayers also receive memories and wisdom stored within their victims' brains, which is immediately transmitted throughout their colony telepathically. At the head of these colonies are Elder Brains. These beings of supreme intelligence manage the illithid communities, accessing the information they hold and using it to further the will of the race. Their goals are known as The Grand Design, which focusses on rebuilding their lost empire, and subjugating their remaining enemies."

Through the absorption of dead illithid brains, Zellix'Phor came to know the causes of the empire's fall and is obsessed with vengeance. Driven by bloodlust, the illithid colony that follows Zellix'Phor searches across the Planes of Existence for githyanki crèches, hoping to decimate their population through infanticide.",
										"Zellix'Phor had become a name that elated mind flayers and brought dread into the hearts of the gith. His devastating effect upon the githyanki population was well known, and horrifying stories were told within that culture of the silent and deadly arrival of the illithid vessel which housed Zellix'Phor and his disciples.",
										"Over time, the colony of Zellix'Phor grew to a point where it could barely sustain itself. All available nautiloid space was dedicated to the illithid, and their thralls were jettisoned to make room for the superior race. The need for brains to fuel the mind flayers meant that the nautiloid in which the colony lived was visiting the Material Plane ever more frequently. Despite generations of tactical warfare knowledge assimilated by the Zellix'Phor, his arrogance became his downfall. The gith had been tracking the nautiloid across the Planes, waiting for the right time to strike. Believing himself invincible, Zellix'Phor commanded the vessel to dock on the Material Plane to stock up on brains, and the ship was attacked.",

They entered the vessel as assassins and decimated the illithid within. Without their thralls to take the brunt of the assault, the mind flayers were on the front line, and despite their formidable psionic capabilities, many were struck down by the silver swords of the Githyanki. The nautiloid crash-landed on the Northlander Isle of Gundarlun, killing nearly all aboard. Unfortunately, Zellix'Phor and his closest attendants managed to survive, sheltered from the destruction in the elder brain chamber of the nautiloid.

Realising time was short, the few Illithid that remained grafted the elder brain pool of Zellix'Phor into the skull of Slarkrethel. With their unmatched knowledge of bioconstruction, the Illithid physically attached Zellix'Phor to Slarkrethel's brainstem, and the two super intellects merged in an otherworldly fashion.

In generations past, most human settlers of the Island Kingdoms were fair-haired and light-skinned. Since then, the riches and promise of the islands have attracted folk from other regions, and several generations of cultural mingling has given the humans of Faerûn much greater diversity in their appearance (see \"{@footnote {@race human|phb|Human Names and Ethnicities}|See the {@i Info} tab of the {@race human} race.}\" in chapter 2 of the {@i Player's Handbook})."

Northfolk ancestors built small villages along the Sword Coast that have since become cities, including fabled Illusk (now Luskan), Eigersstor (now Neverwinter), and Nimoar's Hold (now Waterdeep). These early Northlanders farmed the rocky coastlines, fished coastal waters, and hunted seals and whales on the open sea.",

Along the Sword Coast, some tribes have become fairly civilised, primarily due to the growth of the coastal cities and the increasing influence of outsiders. These people farm, fish, and mine their rugged lands, then shrewdly trade their goods with foreign buyers. Many once-feared tribes have become merchants whose bartering skills are equal to or better than the warlike talents of their ancestors, such that many a Northlander merchant earns more booty than their raiding neighbours. In many cases, however, the Northlanders of the Island Kingdoms still uphold the raiding and reaving culture of their past.

If they arrive in a vessel that belongs to a military faction they are attacked on sight by half a dozen pirate ships (see early warning system below).

Cards, dice, companions-of-the-hour, illicit substances, and questionable deals can readily be found within its creaking timbers. Drunken patrons sometimes fling newcomers and alleged cheaters down a barnacle-filled chute, ejecting them from the prow-fronted building and into the cold waters of the harbour outside. A creature shoved down the chute takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) slashing damage and 10 ({@damage 3d6}) bludgeoning damage.",

Folding tables are erected along the piers and steaming plates of roasted fish, seafood platters, and brightly coloured fruits are passed down, as well as dozens of bottles of wine and rum. During the meal, Sea King Tentrix stands up on one of the tables and makes a toast to the brides. He tells an embarrassing story about Mishann who served on his ship involving a dried monkey skin, too much rum, and a lot of vomit which is met with raucous laughter from all. He then gifts the brides with a pair of mithril rings before sitting back down to his meal.",

Half the pirates in port are loyal to him, and he is escorted everywhere by Captain Scummer and four {@creature thug} bodyguards. Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check can eavesdrop on Tentrix's conversations. He details the reasons for the attacks on the Sword Coast, revealing that he was put up to it by the elders from his home; Purple Rocks.

								"When naval combat breaks out, have each vessel roll initiative separately from the rest of the characters. The ships have a bonus to initiative equal to the average bonus of the crew. For example, a ship crewed by mostly {@creature guard|mm|guards}, who have a {@dice 1d20+1|+1} to initiative, also has a {@dice 1d20+1|+1} to initiative.",
								"A ship can take the following actions on its turn; {@action Attack}, {@action Dash}, or {@action Dodge}. When a ship takes the {@action Attack} action, assume that it uses all its weapons so long as there are enough crew to use them (remembering that some weapons take multiple action to use). Taking the {@action Dash} action allows a ship to move twice as fast as it normally would, but may require a successful Strength check at the DMs discretion. A ship that {@action Dodge|phb|Dodges} is assumed to be manoeuvred in such a way as to make it harder to hit.",
								"At times, the ship may have to make ability checks or saving throws, for example, to avoid a collision with rocks or an enemy vessel, or perhaps to avoid rocks whilst {@action Dash|phb|Dashing}. Like initiative, refer to the average bonus of the crew.",
								"Ships that are damaged can be repaired. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labour. Ships can also be upgraded (see the \"Upgrades\" section).",

All available nautiloid space was dedicated to the illithid, and their thralls were jettisoned to make room for the superior race. The need for brains to fuel the mind flayers meant that the nautiloid in which the colony lived was visiting the Material Plane ever more frequently. Despite generations of tactical warfare knowledge assimilated by the Zellix'Phor, his arrogance became his downfall. The gith had been tracking the nautiloid across the Planes, waiting for the right time to strike. Believing himself invincible, Zellix'Phor commanded the vessel to dock on the Material Plane to stock up on brains, and the ship was attacked.",

They entered the vessel as assassins and decimated the illithid within. Without their thralls to take the brunt of the assault, the mind flayers were on the front line, and despite their formidable psionic capabilities, many were struck down by the silver swords of the Githyanki. The nautiloid crash-landed on the Northlander Isle of Gundarlun, killing nearly all aboard. Unfortunately, Zellix'Phor and his closest attendants managed to survive, sheltered from the destruction in the elder brain chamber of the nautiloid. As far as the githyanki are concerned, the suicide mission was a success."

The local merfolk were corrupted by the evil influence of the leviathans and were forced to serve as guards and caretakers for the newly born krakens.

Dhurge was born with the typical baron mutations (increased strength and extra limbs), but rather than fighting his way to the top of sahuagin society, as most barons do, Dhurge took a different route. While attacking a ship as a juvenile, Dhurge came across a {@item wand of fireballs} and quickly realised how to use the item. The power afforded to him by the item inspired him to search out more and more wands until he had a full set. By the time Dhurge was fully grown, he has discovered more wands than his hands could carry and had mastered their use. The arcane casting didn't go down well with the sahuagin of Kressilacc, Dhurge's home, so he headed south to the Nelanthers where he knew he could find work as a pirate. Here he was approached by Sea King Tentrix, who recruited him into the Black Armada.",

He thinks highly of Tentrix, whose charismatic leadership has united dozens of crews under his command. Dhurge is a four-armed sahuagin with intelligent, beady eyes. He wields a wand in each hand, shooting spells at incredible speed. Dhurge wears a long wizard's robe that is always sodden and is covered in parts by a mossy seaweed.",

Vodyanoi skin is green and slimy to the touch, but beneath it is a thick, knobbly hide. Vodyanoi prey on all manner of marine life but prefer the taste of humanoid flesh. They have learned to rend the hulls of large ships and capsize smaller ones to get to their favourite prey. Perhaps the most peculiar feature of the vodyanoi is its stomach. Rather than digest its own food, the vodyanoi cultivates a small population of eels in its stomach, which it can regurgitate if necessary to help bring down prey"
