After originally paying the party to sneak them into town inside the chest their plan was simply to retrieve their personal belongings.

Anwan's office where the statue is found, is up a set of stairs just off the second cell. It is always locked and can be opened with the key Anwan carries or a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb}. There are windows on both the main and upper level. (Adjust this description as necessary if you have prepared a battle map for this location.)",
										"If the statue is ever touched it triggers an audible {@spell alarm} spell that brings all three guards running. Once Sheriff Anwan and the other two guards are sufficiently distracted by the characters' attempt to steal the statue Larry Halfmandini plans to sneak through the window and snatch it. Larry makes his move only after the {@spell alarm} spell is triggered and he makes Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks at {@dice 1d20+6|+6|Dexterity (Stealth)}.",

The difficulty is lessened (DC 12) if they can somehow return the {@i Gold Statue of Impossible Gravity}. If the players take a more aggressive approach to escaping the sheriff a combat scene breaks out. The sheriff is a {@creature veteran} and his two guards are {@creature thug|mm|thugs}.",
