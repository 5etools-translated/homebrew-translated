						"A human clad in gleaming plate armour stares down a snarling owlbear, slowly reaching for the lance strapped across her back. The owlbear charges before she can reach her weapon, but a gout of fire from the sky stops the owlbear in its tracks. The gold dragon lands in front of the human, its eyes burning with a fiery vengeance as it snorts, causing flames to billow from its nostrils. Mounting her dragon, the human lets out a war cry as the dragon takes off into the air.",
						"Pulling the bowstring back, the elf whispers a few hushed words as an arcane fire erupts around the goblins below. Lightning sparks at the tip of his arrow, and he grins to himself as he fires at the goblin chief. The arrow finding its mark, the goblin chief can barely cry for help as lightning explodes from his body, arcing off to his nearby guards. In the trees, a nearby blue dragon chuckles to itself as it descends upon those left.",
						"The platinum dragon sniffs at some rubble before nudging it, looking back towards a halfling. She comes over and together they shift the rocks. Reaching her hand out, the halfling brushes the hair out of the eyes of the small boy who lies in the rubble. A shield of divine magic wraps around his small frame as the halfling pulls him into her arms, carrying him to safety.",
						"Scowling to himself, the half-orc looks around the darkened cave for his quarry. Letting out a short whistle, a dark dragon, onyx in colour, seems to appear from the shadows with a dead drow in its maw. Rolling his eyes, the half-orc makes a motion with his hands, and the dragon spits out the drow, a sheepish expression on its reptilian face as darkness begins to swirl around the pair, causing them to vanish.",

The dragon is typically the stronger of the pair as they develop, but will be weaker earlier on, while the knight still has to watch over them to ensure their bond can continue to flourish. Eventually, some knights might put down their weapons and live a simple life with their dragon, having forged a legendary friendship through the trials they faced.",
								"This connection has its drawbacks, however, and should the knight fall in battle, the dragon too will die, as the dragon's spirit can't live without the knight. Should the dragon fall in battle, the knight can restore its body with a costly ritual, but a few knights might instead choose to let their dragons rest, and go on to instead simply channel their dragon's power."
