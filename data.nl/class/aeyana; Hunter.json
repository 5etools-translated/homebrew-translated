Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another, sundering the dragon's thick scales.",

Each hunter's techniques are efficiently designed to combat the prey they hunt, employing various tactics to disable and destroy their quarry. Often, hunters' study of their prey leads to adoption of tactics from the very prey they hunt.",
								"Their experience with their prey and the wild lands they inhabit allows hunters to harness nature's power to cast spells, much as a druid does.

Many hunters are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or horde of goblins attacks, a hunter may the the first\u2014and possibly the last\u2014line of defense.",
								"This fierce independence makes hunters well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, hunters respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worthy any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways."

Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of hunters associated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore.
