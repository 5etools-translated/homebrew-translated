The shadow lands, pulls a small metallic object from her belt and flicks it toward the chieftain. As the object moves forward it unspools into a scourge made of sharp interlocked links of chain. The orc is no match for the whirling shadow. As the chieftain falls, the shadow flicks her wrist again and the weapon is once again safely and unobtrusively stowed on her belt.

The wrenches and gears that adorn his outfit rattle and clank as he is propelled forward with a burst of speed, safely out of the creature's grasp.
