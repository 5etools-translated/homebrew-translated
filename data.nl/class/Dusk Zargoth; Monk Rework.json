However, to be considered a monk, it is required that one persistently and rigurously trains body and spirit, for they believe that only when both work in harmony and are pushed past its limitations everyday that one can reach their perfect self. Such is the goal of every monk. It is for that purpose that many monastic traditions have been created, for the path is unique for each individual.",
								"Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve their mentor or a divine power, often to fulfill a spiritual task, others to carry out an important mission. In some cases, they embark themselves on a meaningful journey for self discovery.",

Thus, those who leave their cloisters don't undertake this change lightly. They work diligently, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. Monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than slaying monsters and plundering their treasure."

These abilities have in common the lack of key words for its trigger, such as hit, succeed, miss, or fail, which is why you can choose to use these after seeing the roll, but before the DM says wether the roll succeeds or fails."
