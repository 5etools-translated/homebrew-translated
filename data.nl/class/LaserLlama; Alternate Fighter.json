						"The young guard quietly slipped past his comrades out the back door of the armory where the townsfolk were hiding. A bandit gang had come upon the town suddenly that morning, and their captain had issued a challenge. If a warrior from the town could best him in single combat, his gang of bandits would leave peacefully. Even though the young man had only joined the town guard one season ago, he could already best every other guard with the sword. To the surprise of the townsfolk, he drew his sword, muttered a prayer, and stepped forward to defend his home.",
						"A graying dwarf surveyed the enemy camp as the sun began to set. Along with three of her best soldiers, she had come to the edge of the enemy camp with the intent to rout the army or die in the attempt. In a fully pitched battle, the small band of dwarves she commanded wouldn't stand a chance against this great host. However, if her group of elite soldiers followed her orders to the letter, they had a chance to cut off the head of the army before it came to all out battle. For what could be her final mission, she gripped the haft of her battleaxe and gave the order to move out.",
						"The flamboyant elven gladiator paused for a moment, basking in the roar of the crowd. He remembered his first gladiatorial match in the underground arena, surrounded by drunken pirates and slavers. Now he performed for the king and queen amidst the bustle of the largest city in the kingdom. The time to savor this moment was over, and in a flash, he wheeled around and plunged his gilded spear into the heart of his opponent, ending what would be the final fight of his gladiatorial career and earning his freedom.",

A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors."
