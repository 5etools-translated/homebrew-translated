You can use this feature if you are on the Ethereal Plane, the Feyrealm, the Material Plane, or the Shadowrealm. No magical or physical restrictions can prevent you from accomplishing the planar travel made possible by this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest."
