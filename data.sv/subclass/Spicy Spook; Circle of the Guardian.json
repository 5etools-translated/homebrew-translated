				"Druids are worshippers of nature, able to weave its primeval power into mighty spells that bend the elements of the natural world to their will and transform into all manner of beasts. There are some druids however who see a different path to that power. Instead of transforming into beasts, they choose to embody the steadfast strength of the forest, the interconnected web of life that shields its inhabitants, and the ever nurturing boons of its fruits, channeling their druidic power to embody those aspects. Those within the Circle of the Guardian, also known as greenkeepers or emerald knights, literally cloak themselves in nature itself, becoming mighty bulwarks and protectors of all living things.",
