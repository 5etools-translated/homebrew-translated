He slips it between the doors and steps back. The card explodes, leaving the door in pieces. A woman runs down the street being chased by a group of thugs. She pulls out her deck of cards and quickly shuffles. She pulls the top card. The card starts to glow. She drops it on the ground. A moment later, as the thugs run over the card, the card explodes, taking the thugs out. A battle rages upon a blood-soaked field overlooked by a regal keep. In its center, stands a lone battle-worn tiefling fighting for his life. A pair of hulking spectral arms sprout from his back, allowing the tiefling to wield four axes at once. He charges into a group of soldiers, wreathing himself in flames as the lone figure carves into the enemy line. Each step taken could be his last, yet the tiefling fights with the widest of grins.",
