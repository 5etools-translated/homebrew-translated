				"At 17th level, the Espíritu has reached Lucha enlightenment and become one with his ancestor's spirits. Changing into your Spirit of the Mask form no longer expends an Inspiration Dice. You may change your spirit form during any of your actions at the cost of an Inspiration Dice. When you change into your spirit form or change forms, you may combine 2 aspects instead of 1. Also, at the start of any combat phase, you always start with a minimum number of Inspiration dice equal to your Constitution modifier."
