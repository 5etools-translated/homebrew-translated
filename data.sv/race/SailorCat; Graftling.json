							"A miserable pile of assorted bones. Graftlings are corpses who have had their skeletons transformed, grafted with those of other creatures, and infused with negative energy. They are given teeth with which to extract and pulverize bone, corrosive digestive fluids to break down and assimilate it, and the hunger to consume it. How closely a graftling resembles its original race is up to the whim of its creator, but because graftlings are the product of transplantation rather than total reconstruction, there is generally some resemblance. All graftlings end up a perversion of the skeleton.",
							"While a graftling's silhouette can oftentimes pass as humanoid, its anatomy errs. Beneath its bundle lies a twisted skeletal system, grafted in ways nature never intended. Here and there, bones are creased or gnarled from the strain of being shaped, like the roots of an ancient tree. An arm may contain the nose of a sawfish, the talons of a wyvern, and the ribs of howler\u2014all of it mingled with the graftling's original skeleton. A typical graftling arrangement also includes portions that appear to be stock. Most commonly, the head and torso. However, this resemblance is only skin-deep. Blood is drained, organs become bone, cartilage masquerades as muscle and scar tissue. Within a suitable cavity, graftlings are then equipped with the system responsible for dissolving bone (a graftling is immune to its own acid). Because this remains active, it's common for graftlings to drool, especially in sight of a meal. A necromancer must provide either teeth and jaws capable of crushing bone, or a means to insert it directly into the cavity.",
							"The magic by which a graftling's skeleton was manipulated becomes a permanent feature. This enables them to evolve beyond their creator's vision, attaching more bones as they see fit. Some add ribs sparingly; others favor  embellishment. More than mere form over function, graftlings can assimilate limbs in this manner, which allows them to act with greater efficiency.",
							"There are reasons beyond simple experimentation that might inspire a necromancer to create a graftling. Due to their intelligence and reserved disposition, graftlings make practical, less ambitious apprentices. What's more, what was once a miserable pile of assorted bones can now dispose of any unwanted miserable piles of assorted bones. While graftlings often emerge with their intelligence intact, the same cannot always be said for their identity. All find that some part of their past self is invariably corrupted in the process."

Graftlings will avoid fighting for corpses, preferring caution to a meal for which they hunger but do not need.",
