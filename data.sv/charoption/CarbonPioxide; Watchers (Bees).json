				"Something is always watching you and draws ethereal spirits that take the form of bees made of shadowstuff that follow you and gather in your general vicinity. These creatures act like normal examples of their kind, but their behaviour suggests a hint of malice. No matter what precautions you take, you can't permanently drive these spirits away. They always return, wait just beyond the reach of deterrents, or later crawl out of your clothes and equipment.",
