Five stakes have already been torn from the ground. While anchored to the floor, she is restrained.

								"Mystical tattoos are an ancient form of magic that imparts bearers with extraordinary gifts. They can be seen on any creature willing to allow magic to be embedded deeper into their being than ever before.",
								"A tattoo's magical properties are born of their magically imbued designs, often a testament to the original tattooist's expertise. A great example of this is a special variant of magic tattoos known as spellbangers, smaller designs replicating arcane spellcasting, restricted to the same tattooist that created them.",
								"Magic tattoos are imbued with power by their creators. While sketching, tattooists weave their magics directly into the ink of their design. The design is layered with intent, serving as both pathway and instructions for the tattooist's magic. This can be an impossible task for those inexperienced in the tattooists' method. In a process that takes just a few seconds after the design's completion, the magic blooms within the design, and it acquires its intended effect or property.",

										"The practice adopted by tattooists for distributing their magic tattoos is simple and permits them to benefit from their work, while still allowing for tattoos to be widely accessible. Magic tattoos are initially sketched within the pages of an enchanted sketchbook by a tattooist. After the design is drawn on an enchanted sketchbook page, any individual may extract that tattoo into an empty needle using tattooist's tools. This allows designs to be more easily distributed or acquired. The page is empty once the design is extracted, but a special needle is now ready to be applied.",

										"The {@item tattooist's tools|ToMT} are a type of artisan's tools consisting of two main components - the {@item hammer|ToMT} and {@item chisel|ToMT}. The chisel contains a simple mechanism that can twist to clasp onto needles of various widths. The hammer can act as an activator when it strikes the chisel, temporarily applying a magnetic property unique to magically-imbued inks into the needle.",
										"One of the main uses of tattooist's tools in regards to magic tattoos is extraction. An individual holds the chisel affixed with an empty needle against an {@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT} page or skin upon which a magic tattoo is applied. The wielder then taps the opposite end of the chisel, drawing the tattoo design inside of the affixed, empty needle.",
										"The tattooist's tools also include plenty of needles and medical supplies for sterilization. This is necessary in case the tattooist's tools are used to apply mundane tattoos as well. For non-magical tattoo applications, the chisel's needle can be dipped into the appropriate pigments and then hammered against an individual's skin, scales, or feathers to ink a tattoo."

									"name": "Application & Attunement",
									"entries": [
										"Applying a magic tattoo from a needle simply requires that the special needle be held against one's skin. A magic tattoo counts towards the number of magic items to which a creature can attune.",
										"The design slowly flows from the needle into the skin upon contact, molding itself to suit the individual's body. An applied tattoo appears as it did on its sketchbook page, retaining the visual properties of the ink used when it was sketched. In this way, the design transitions from page to person through a needle.",
										"For unusual skin types, the tattoo will often take on a different form. As an example, a creature covered in fur or feathers might witness the tattoo take shape as markings as it leaves the needle. A creature with a metallic exterior might see the tattoo engrave itself onto their shell. As a tattoo is simply another form of magic item, this can be interpreted as the attunement process.",
										"The process to end attunement to a magic tattoo is different from the process to end attunement to a normal magic item. A creature other than the one to whom the tattoo is applied must use tattooist's tools and an empty needle to extract the tattoo from the skin, as it was once extracted from a tattooist's sketchbook page."

These factors will determine whether the tattoo suits its future bearer and whether the tattoo will work in harmony with their existing abilities. You will find that tattoos ranging drastically in rarity and power can be of the same proportion.",
										"Also of note, magic tattoos that are applied on the same body part can coexist. All magic tattoos can be layered upon each other, with individuals not having to fear for their properties being tainted or diminished. Magic tattoos are sketched with purpose, and are not so easily disrupted simply by their proximity to one other. In this case, an individual can mentally decide which tattoo sits at the forefront to make it so."

Though appreciative of the entertainment provided in their streets and taverns at first, the townsfolk soon grew disinterested in Quid's tales. In response, Quid began to focus on a younger audience, knowing that children would bring their parents, and the parents, their purses. Unfortunately, the demands of entertaining children who constantly asked to hear the same songs and stories repeated ad nauseum was a wearying task. The magical properties of this tattoo allowed the bard to have his music repeated with no effort on his part, aside from passing around the collection plate."

Though a howl came at the end of the shot, the hunter found nothing when she went to investigate, save for a patch of dark blood upon the grass. Having no ammunition left, the hunter returned home and slept. She was awoken in the middle of the night by a loud scraping at the door. Armed with her bow, she cautiously opened it. Again, she found nothing. As she bent low to investigate, a large creature caught her side and knocked her weapon away. She retreated into the cabin, slamming the door behind her. Without a weapon with which to defend herself, she found a bottle of poison and coated it all over her body. It was a long night, but soon the dawn came and she still drew breath. Years later, her daughter designed this tattoo, inspired by her mother's harrowing tale and final attempt at defending herself."

However, at the end of a chaotic battle between two kingdoms, Benne was struck by an errant arrow and killed. Unwilling to bear the loss and struck by divine inspiration, Soma burned a magical tattoo into her flesh at that moment to bind Benne's spirit to her own. Together, they shared one body. Legends say that people slain by Soma would see Benne alongside her."

However, after the arrival of an enterprising newcomer that dabbled in tattooing, they rose to become the jewel of the Bernian army. Mere weeks after his arrival, the platoon's weapons had all been imprinted with a strange but complex marking. Wave after wave of enemy soldiers fell under their spears, and their reputation as juggernauts only grew until the war's end. Enemy prisoners would later relay the odd sensation they felt after being pricked by the platoon's blades, stressing that they suddenly felt their strength and litheness leave them."

					"There once lived a rogue name Esteban Gil, who had a habit of robbing the homes of extravagant spellcasters. He would tell his acquaintances that these targets always brought home and stashed away precious magical loot without any thought for security. The only problem Esteban ran into was if the homeowner happened to be home at the time of his raids. Over the course of his career, Esteban had been turned into a serpent, had his pants burnt off, and had his left foot exchanged with his right for almost a year. It took many requests and more than a few gold pieces, but a determined tattoo artist eventually managed to craft the right design for Esteban's daggers. One that rendered his targets a little less \"magical\" and a little more willing to part with their belongings during the little rogue's visits."

He would later remark that it felt as though his hand was being guided as he crafted the tattoo. Once applied, Valeria quickly realized the tattoo came with divine properties, blessed in recognition of the noblewoman's stewardship over the goddess' domain."

Pimble's skin, usually numb from the beating of the waterfall, tingled and glowed, and strange markings began to appear across their body. They felt a divine energy course through them and thanked the gods for this gift. Raiko was delighted to see the sprite stand up to its stunned bullies, and never again was Pimble the butt of their jokes."
