At the end of this time you can offer insight into the subject's possible future. These details are always vague, and both the information and its accuracy are up to the DM's discretion. Regardless of the information attained, the reading affords you the chance to gain insight into your subject and possibly enter their good graces. After giving a reading, you can expect a client to be more relaxed and willing to favorably consider any proposal you make (treat them as one category more favorable for purposes of social interaction, DMG p. 244). Additionally, you can receive minor favors or consideration from past subjects in a variety of locations. Assume you can find at least one friendly contact in a city in which you have spent at least some time in the past."
