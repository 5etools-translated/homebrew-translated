						"Simple in concept, tricky in execution, a magical tattoo largely resembles a spell scroll or magical item. It allows a character who has one to c ast one spell as shorthanded by the symbol inked into their skin when the tattoo is activated. The use of a magical tattoo does not require the use of a spell slot, nor is any given magical tattoo restricted to a specific class; a wealthy bard, for instance, might obtain a Glyph of Life Aura, or a paladin who has failed one too many saving throws against the Frightened condition might save her coin for a Glyph of Countercharm.",

The enchanted inks must be mixed to the exactly correct proportions. Generally, only the eldest and wisest arc anists can perform this art alone, and most at least have an apprentice to help with the more mundane elements. A magical tattoo shop will generally have one arc anist to mix the inks, another to design the glyphs, and a third to actually wield the needle. This makes the process costly, but worthwhile when performed by experts."

Two tattoos cannot share space on one spot on the wearer's body, as the interaction between the two glyphs nullifies the magic and can have unforeseen and devastating effects. Thus a character considering a permanent Glyph of Blade Ward might consider whether that is the tattoo that would serve them best long-term, or whether they should wait and save up for better things."

								"Placing limits on how a magical tattoo can be used, and how many times, is probably the best way of dealing with the inherent balance issues. After all, magical tattooing is a costly business, requiring specialised knowledge, tools and components to implement. Keeping the cost high encourages players to consider exactly what they want to get out of their magical tattoo, and how to fit their desires into their existing budget. This has the added advantage of being able to offer your players a new encounter as they tr y to raise money for that highly useful permanent tattoo... or even hunt for the raw ingredients requested by the tattooist, depending on setting."

While still c arr ying the advantages of not spending a spell slot and not being restricted by class, a tattoo that c asts a Concentration effect would still require concentration on the part of the wearer, so they could not have another Concentration spell in effect while the tattoo is active.

While not requiring attunement in the manner of most magical items, various types of tattoo must be inked onto certain spots on the body to be effective, which restricts the number and type. For instance, protective glyphs such as Glyph of Blade Ward and Glyph of Ice Armor are worn on the same spot over the breastbone, restricting a character to having only one of these at any given time."

								"Another way to reduce a tattoo's usage is to make it firmly part of the game world on a stor y level, rather than just another magical item. When world-building, consider that some countries might have laws against magical tattoos of that nature. Alternatively, perhaps the practice of magical tattooing is so well-known in the game world that enterprising arc anists and spellc asters have found ways to nullify or even steal magical tattoos. This adds an element of challenge and danger to simply having such tattoos, and creates a chance of the wearer being unable to use them."

								"Finally, one of the better ways of ensuring nothing too game breaking finds its way onto a character's skin is to restrict the availability of certain spells beyond the simple cost. While the option exists to allow your players to ask in character if a particular spell is available on a tattoo, thus letting the DM decide whether it should exist and how much it would cost if it did, it's better to have at least a general idea what would or would not be available in that particular location based on what you as the DM think would be reasonable for your campaign."
