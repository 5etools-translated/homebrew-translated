Most who seek to become channelers perform the Rite of Binding on themselves, using their bodies as ritual components in place of a gate, and become linked to a key in the process. This ritual is a taxing and perilous endeavor, requiring a strong body and mind, for it was not designed to be undertaken by living things.

If two or more of the creature's ability scores are tied for highest, you choose which ability score is reduced. The creature also has disadvantage on saving throws with its lowest ability scores. On its turn, the target can use its action to make a Constitution saving throw, ending this spell on a success.At higher levels, you can make more attacks with your weapons. At 5th level, you can make two attacks, at 11th level, three attacks, and at 17th level, four attacks."
