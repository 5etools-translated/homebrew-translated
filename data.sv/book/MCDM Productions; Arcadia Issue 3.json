						"Här är vi vid vårt första stopp på ARCADIA-vägen. Från början sa vi att MCDM planerade att göra tre utgåvor och sedan bedöma om man skulle fortsätta eller inte. När vi inledde denna satsning var jag inte säker på hur tidningen skulle tas emot. Ville folk ha mer innehåll i femte upplagan på regelbunden basis? Det finns redan en hel del där ute! Därför behövde vi göra mer än att bara tillhandahålla innehåll. Den här tidningen behövde bli något speciellt med de bästa författare och konstnärer vi kunde hitta. Så vi byggde upp ett exceptionellt team och vi gillade vad vi skapade, men hur reagerade ni?",
						"Svaret: superpositivt. Jag skriver det här brevet efter att nummer 1 har släppts, och redan nu har era svar och er entusiasm för innehållet överträffat mina högsta förhoppningar. Våra Patreon-nummer har skjutit i höjden, vi får all slags kärlek på sociala medier, och ni hittar, följer och berömmer också våra författare och artister. Ni har talat. Ni vill ha mer ARCADIA, och vi kommer att ge er det.",
						"Faktum är att författare, konstnärer och spelare redan arbetar med kommande utgåvor. Vi håller fortfarande på att utarbeta tidsplanen för utgivningen, men vi hoppas kunna ge dig illustrerat, redigerat och speltestat innehåll med jämna mellanrum när vi finjusterar vår process för obestämd produktion.",
						"ARCADIA utvecklas fortfarande, och teamet gör det genom att lyssna på dig. Vår första ARCADIA-enkät kommer att vara tillgänglig för Patreon-patroner strax efter att vi publicerat detta nummer. Resultaten hjälper oss att identifiera det mest användbara och roliga innehållet för ditt spelbord, och låter dig framföra önskemål om artiklar som du vill läsa i framtiden. Vi kommer också att fråga dig om nytt innehåll som vi har idéer till! Vi vill veta vad du gillar, för du bidrar till att ARCADIA blir en succé!",
						"Våra Patreon-undersökningar är inte det enda stället där du kan prata med oss om ARCADIA. I MCDM Discord och Reddit finns det bra folk som pratar om allt som rör rollspel. (En eloge till de otroliga moderatorerna för MCDM-gemenskapen som verkligen gör dessa underbara platser att umgås på.) Det är faktiskt bra ställen att gå till för att hitta fans som skapar eget innehåll inspirerat av tidningen. Minns du Willy Abeels artikel om \"Jumping on Mounted Combat\"? Du kan hitta ett gäng nya mount stat block på Reddit som är inspirerade av det som Willy skapade. Det är bara toppen av det otroliga isberget.",
						"Med allt detta prat om framtiden glömde jag nästan att berätta att det här numret av ARCADIA är vårt mest ambitiösa hittills. Vi har fyra otroliga artiklar till dig, som alla fokuserar på nya områden av spelet för den här tidningen: ett rollspelsfokuserat mysterieäventyr från Alison Huang, tio nya trollformler för femte upplagan från Celeste Conowitch, tre nya drömfokuserade förfäder från Justice Arman och regler för luftstrid från Sam Mannell. Hittills har vi haft dungeon crawls, mysterier, underklasser, trollformler, förfäder, monster och alla möjliga nya regler. Vad kommer vi att göra härnäst? Gå med i våra gemenskaper. Låt oss veta.",
