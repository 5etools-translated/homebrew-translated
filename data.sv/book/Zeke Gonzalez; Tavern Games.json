						"My players have an insatiable appetite for playing games in local taverns. This small supplement was born from their enjoyment of a variety of games of skill in taverns spread all throughout our campaign. Some of these games are fantasy adaptations of popular games in my life, and others are my own personal take on tavern games that I have heard or read about. These constitute the most popular and successful of the games which I have implemented into my campaigns, and I hope you and your players enjoy them. Keep in mind that the success of these games depend entirely on the ability of you and your players to narrate the event- don't be afraid to add an element of suspense, or to describe the details of the encounter! I will repeatedly remind and encourage you to be as imaginative as possible throughout this supplement, and provide short examples which I hope inspire you to create fantastical tavern games for you and your players! Of course, I encourage Dungeon Masters to adapt these games in order to make them more appropriate for your game and your players.",

								"A burly dragonborn, sweat on his brow, is locked fist-in-fist with a grinning halfling clad in various furs. The bar is loud with cheers and clinking glasses as the two are stuck in a stalemate. Their eyes narrowed at one another over their trembling clenched fists. Suddenly, the halfling lets loose a barbaric shout and slams the fist of the dragonborn onto the scarred wooden table. A chorus of cheers go up behind the halfling and she winks at the astonished dragonborn before waltzing to the bar.",
								"Arm wrestling is a classic, two-person contest of strength! If the player is competing against an NPC, be sure to describe the opponent. Is it a goblin trapper with a humorously large left bicep? Is it a burly human guard? Or maybe a seemingly wimpy elf who turns out to be a barbarian that rages during the contest? Be creative!",

										"The two contestants undergo a contest of strength by making a series of opposing Strength checks from an even starting position. There are two positions past the starting position on each side, and upon losing a check at the second position, a contestant must succeed on a strength saving throw against the winning contestant's Strength score or be tapped out.",
										"A natural 20 on a strength check moves a contestant forward by two positions and a natural 20 on a strength saving throw returns them to the starting position. A natural 1 on a strength check moves a contestant backwards by two positions.",
										"Let's examine these mechanics from the above example of Layla the halfling and Reynard the dragonborn. They roll a opposing strength checks from a starting position. Layla rolls a 12 and Reynard rolls a 15, so Reynard is able to muster the will to push Layla's arm into the next position. However, on the next check, Layla rolls a Natural 20 against Reynard's 16! Layla hunkers down and, with a burst of strength, is able to push Reynard back to the starting position- and then down to the next position on the opposite side. On the next throw, Reyard rolls a 12 against Layla's 10, and now the two are once more evenly matched in the center. At this point, Layla enters her Barbarian Rage, conferring advantage on her Strength checks, and allowing her to beat Reynard in the next two checks, pushing Reynard into the second position. Here Reynard flubs yet another Strength check and proceeds to make a Strength saving throw, where he rolls an 11. Unfortunately for him, Layla is a beefy halfling with a Strength score of 14, meaning that he fails his saving throw and Layla is able to slam Reynard's fist to the table amid a chorus of cheers!"

If an arm wrestling competition goes on for six checks (or you see the players begin to lose interest), have any contestants who are not proficient in arm wrestling make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of the opponent's Strength score. If a contestant fails, they gain disadvantage for the remainder of the contest. Any NPC who the DM deems to be an experienced arm wrestler may have profiency in arm wrestling, and a player may gain proficiency in arm wrestling by winning 10 arm wrestling matches within a week!"
