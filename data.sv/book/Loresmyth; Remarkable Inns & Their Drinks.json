								"Cards, dice and drinking games are commonplace in taverns, but some games are only found in certain places, played by locals and passed on through the generations.

										"Usually played on a carved wooden playing board divided into eight triangular sections, Trollbones is a simple, yet addictive game that requires only 4 small twigs or bones to play. Any number of contestant can participate, making it suitable for groups. Although some believe otherwise (especially after a few pints), Trollbones requires almost no skill and is largely luck-based.",
										"{@b The playing board}: Trollbones is played on a square board, commonly made of wood and divided in eight triangular sections. Six sections have a number carved into them, one section a sun, and one section a moon. Rabbit or chicken bones are the common player pieces. Carved ivory or twigs are adequate substitutes. Whatever is used, all contestants play with the same set for the entire game.",
										"{@b The rules}: Players take 3 turns, one at a time, moving clockwise around the board. Each turn is made up of 3 throws in which players take their 4 \"bones\" and let them drop onto the playing board from a hand-height. Players hold the bones at least 6\" above the board and drop them, attempting to land the ends onto the marked spaces. The results are added up for the total score that turn. For example: a bone has one end touching the number 1, the other touching the number 4, making a score of 5. Both ends of the bone must rest on a number or specific symbol in order to score points. If one of the ends lands on a moon symbol and the other on a number, the score of that throw is doubled. If one of the ends lands on a sun symbol, the throw results in a score of zero regardless of the other bones' result, suggesting the sun has turned the troll bones into stone.",
										"{@b Winning}: Each player has 3 throws per turn, before continuing to the next player. When all turns have finished, scores are totaled. The player with the highest score wins.",
										"Different variations on the game exist, and each group uses different ways to wager and ante, such as letting the prize pot grow over many rounds, culminating in a grand \"take-it-all\" last round."

										"This game is played on a rectangular gaming board, using wooden, colored pawns and a set of 4-sided dice. One player attempts to break down the wall and rush his pawns to the other side, while the other player attempts to defend and rebuild the wall.",
										"{@b The playing board}: The game is played on a board divided in two halves, each made up of 18 squares with a row of 6 squares running across the middle. Six four-sided dice rest on this middle row, which is usually colored or etched to represent a wall or mountain range dividing the two sides. Each player has 12 pawns (colored stones or marbles are also used) to represent their soldiers or miners deployed on their side of the wall, leaving the last row of squares on each side empty at the start of the game.",
										"{@b The rules}: A coin toss decides who starts as the attacking player. The other defends. On his turn, the attacking player roles a d4 to score a hit against one of the pieces of wall (or mountain range) damaging it and taking points off it equal to the scored result. A score of 4 or higher removes that piece of wall, allowing pawns to start moving through. The attacking player may choose which part of the wall it hits, as long as he has a pawn directly in front of it. On his turn, the defending player makes the same roll, but can use the score to repair a piece of the wall. Once a breach in the wall has been made, each player can choose (on their turn) to move one pawn to the other side of the board, by rolling the die. The result determines how many squares the pawn may move. A move is only allowed when a pawn ends on an empty square. If it does and passes an opponent's pawn this way, it kills the pawn in the process. Diagonal moves are allowed.",
										"{@b Winning}: The winner is determined by whoever has the most pawns on the last square line of the opponent's board, minus any casualties. The game ends when there are no more pawns are on the board, or all remaining pawns have reached the last row of the opponent's side"
