When enemies catch up to the Grim Accord, they often see only two of the four members of the Accord, who are not as unaware as they appear.",

Kryx uses his hyena form for defensive mobility, moving to advantageous positions then reverting to his humanoid form to cast spells like heat metal on heavily armored opponents, blight on lightly armored foes, or call lightning on groups. Athlonia uses her Defensive Shadowstep to defend allies pinned down by enemies. Using this reaction, she can often defend two allies separated across the battlefield. Uldun stays out of sight, using his Cunning Action to hide and hitting defensive spellcasters with longbow attacks.",
