					"A series of regal-looking interconnected hallways are dimly lit with magical torches suspended in sconces. The entrance that the intruders come through suddenly closes itself off, and the intruders sit in silence for a few seconds. Looking down one of the other hallways reveals a slowly encroaching patch of darkness that snuffs out the torches as it makes its way forward, which relight themselves when intruders approach them while the darkness is not nearby. The intruders must search the various corridors while simultaneously avoiding the patch of darkness, which envelops and leaves no trace of anything that enters it. Any attempts to do combat with the darkness prove ineffectual, as anything that enters vanishes, never to be seen again. The darkness is semi-sentient, and the intruders can interact with it by trying to hide from it or get it to follow them. The key to escaping the hallways lies with the magic torches in the two impressively decorated sconces that the darkness can't seem to pass by. By removing one of the special torches and carrying it with them, an intruder can hold off the darkness or even push it back. However, confronting it for too long will begin to dim the torch until it eventually snuffs out, forcing the holder to escape the darkness in order for the torch to relight. When the special torches approach the darkness from both sides of a hallway, it condenses and eventually fades, leaving a shadowy door to the outside where the last of it vanished."

					"A roughly cut gemstone hovers ominously over a crude alter in a cavernlike room while a malicious spirit floats up around the ceiling and out of sight. New entities entering the room causes the crystal turn to face the intruders, revealing that it is actually an eye of some sort, containing a pupil that darts rapidly between the intruders and the spirit. The spirit immediately begins cajoling the crystal eye into destroying the intruders, talking to it as though it were a child in need of guidance. After a few seconds of apparent listening, the eye completely focuses on the spirit and pillars of rock begin to rapidly erupt from the room's surfaces at points near the intruders. The pillars, while initially inaccurate, begin homing in on the intruders more and more the longer they stay still, and do 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The key to escaping the room is the crystal eye in the center of the room, which is being told by the spirit to kill the intruders. By being more persuasive than the spirit, intruders can convince the eye to stop its onslaught and eventually target the spirit instead, which will disperse after being hit multiple times with pillars of rock. The eye is very childlike in its considerations and will lose focus if the intruders fail to convince it or begin to act too impatient. Simplistic approaches work well, and the eye responds positively to constructive encouragement when it targets the intruders (That was some very good aiming, I could feel the wind rush by me! Next time though, try to aim towards the mean spirit instead, OK?). Once the spirit is destroyed, a gentle suggestion that the eye create an exit will convince it to pull a slab of rock away from a wall and reveal a passage to outside the room."

Once the next hallway both statues have hands that turn, and one activates the traps just cleared while the other deactivates the ones ahead (but both can't happen so if the try to deactivate the traps ahead it will still be active). And finally the last hallway will deactivate the traps but the floor is pressure sensitive. Illustrate this by having the party see the hand start to turn back when a member starts to walk across.

A kobold who was waiting kicks a weight attached to a chain out and it drags the member down the side of the cliff to about 20 ft. above the next level (assuming they don't pass a strength check at disadvantage). The ambush comes and there are kobolds on the lower level trying to reach the member while the party is ambushed and distracted. They will have to decide who is saving their friend and who is fighting, while the member is dangling and until he gets himself right side up is at a disadvantage to all attacks.

This is an interesting thing to note if your chosen method of storing gold coins is in a wire-mesh cage attached to the ceiling. Especially if such a cage is kept at very high temperature, and is trapped with various kinds of flame traps (flame traps that trigger onto the gold). Unfortunately, while the temperature might be relatively high compared to the meltin point of most metal, it's still more than enough to cook any flesh it comes in contact with (and STICK to that flesh, as molten metal tends to, causing the WORST sort of burns). And of course, the easiest way to get at the gold itself is from directly below it. Be sure to note to the party how hot it is in the room with the gold while they're standing under it.

The peasant's family has a deep-rooted fear of the fey, and is actively trying to put a stop to the pair's relationship. The family is even more fearful that the peasant will leave for the Feywild and never return, and goes to the party to convince them to help break the two lovers up. The human is in love with the Fey's otherworldly allure and sharp wit; talking to them makes the peasant feel alive in a way that they've never felt before. The Fey was originally only interested in the concept of a secretive human lover, but eventually came to love the peasant's dedication to their relationship despite the risk of alienating other loved ones."

				],
				[
					"32",
					"Beholder Sushi: Beauty may be in the eye of the Beholder, but it's taste is in the eye stalks! Really speaking, this can be made with most Beholder-kin (such as Spectators) and even enjoyed as sashimi. If you're too squeamish about eating the ‚Äòtentacles' of your floating eyeball nightmares raw, simply coat in batter and crispy breadcrumbs for an excellent (if dangerous) kalimari."
				],
				[
					"33",
					"Gorgon Roast: While not technically edible itself, the rocky/metallic remains of a Gorgon Bull Male am excellent oven for the smart, open minded adventurer. Lighting a fire beneath an I damaged portion of the bill allows you to turn it into a giant cooling vessel. Always aim to remove the head cleanly for the best results. Once slain, it will become perfectly hollow, but always allow to air for one hour to allow any remnants of its vapours to escape. Then stuff the metal carcass with any other meat you can hunt and enjoy the satisfaction on multiple levels."
				],
				[
					"34",
					"Sahaguin Roe: Questionable, as the creature is seen as humanoid by most adventurers, the eggs of these fishlike creatures are much like salmon roe, popping with small explosions of flavour on the tongue."
				],
				[
					"35",
					"Dryad Tea: Should one find a friendly Dryad, always ask for some leaves or petals to add an excellent infusion of flavour. These flavours change depending on the Dryads mood when gifting the leaves. For the best results, flirt gently with the nature spirit. NEVER take the leaves or remains of a dead or corrupted Dryad unless planning on brewing laxatives or poisons."
				],
				[
					"36",
					"Seared Scorpion: Either boil or sear the meat in the shell, then consume similar to lobster or other shellfish. Heating the shell not only makes it easier to break, but also allows the meat to steam inside the shell, making for a much more tender meal."
				],
				[
					"37",
					"Slaughterfish Stew: One of the few fish that tastes better stewed. For the best results, skin the fish pieces and poach in milk instead."
				],
				[
					"38",
					"Pan-fried Cockatrice: Tastes so much better than chicken! A favourite of adventurers and food connoisseurs the world over, this versatile meat can be fried, breaded and barbecued for an excellent and filling meal with very little effort... except for killing the creature in the first place. It's also rumoured to help the joints, especially after petrification."
				],
				[
					"39",
					"Phoenix Soup: Not made with actual Phoenix. This is made with a meat of your choice and a Phoenix feather. No fire necessary. Simple break the feather around the middle and drip 3 drops of the golden liquid into the soup you've prepared. For added flavour, shave the feather stem into your soup or save them for another night. You should now have a filling, spicy dish that will revitalise you and leave you feeling refreshed and ready to carry on, night or day!"
				],
				[
					"40",
					"Manticore Skewers: Slightly dangerous. Never break the spines, and only ever use unbroken spines to begin with. Cut the manticore meat into bite sized pieces before skewering. Roast on an open fire. If the spine explodes, do not eat the meat. If prepared correctly, the spicy, fiery toxin will denature and become something akin to a sauce or marinade as it leaches out of the skewer and into the meat as it cooks. Not for the faint of heart."
				],
				[
					"41",
					"Dragon: A notoriously difficult meat. Dragons are normally sentient creatures, but the lesser dragons (including wyverns and wyrms) are considered fair game. Excluding the alchemical ingredients, such as the eyes or heart (which must always be consumed raw if used in magical recipes or rituals), most of a dragon is meat, just like any animal. After the arduous task of scaling (best done with the beasts own claws or teeth), the meat must be cooked on an incredibly hot flame, regardless of species. It is believed to be physically impossible to overlook dragon. Also, the dragons tongue is entirely edible. Often considered an alchemical ingredient, it can be cooked or dried into jerky. It often holds a little innate magic, transferring the knowledge of languages the creature knew in life, if any. An interesting (and tasty) way to learn some new words."
				],
				[
					"42",
					"Gryphon sirloin: Often utterly ruined by the casual adventurer, the Gryphon should be butchered by a professional whenever possible. A well prepared, fresh Gryphon sirloin will often fetch as much money as the party will receive from felling the beast in the first place! Surprisingly tender and flavourful, the meat is a strange combination of white and red, fusing the best of both into some of the best meat known to men or elves."
				],
				[
					"43",
					"Fried Goblin Ears: Works with a variety of ears, so long as the adventurer isn't picky or is desperate. Favourite snacks of the bandit tribes of the south, the fried ears of their foes are enjoyed by all ages after the rest of the corpse has been robbed, stripped and butchered... maybe skip this recipe..."
				],
				[
					"44",
					"Whole Roast Dire Boar: Wild pigs have nothing on the elusive Dire Boar. Even Dire Wolf packs think twice before attempting to bring down one of these colossal swine! Often as big as a small elephant, the only way to enjoy this is to roast it whole. Make it a celebration. The whole hunting party should help gathering wood and building a large enough spit to cook the kill. Carve away meat once cooked like kebab meat and enjoy with the whole village!"

					"45",
					"Roast potatoes in Troll Fat: No duck fat for these crispy adventurers favourites! Simply roast in a clay oven after cutting into quarters and covering liberally with Troll fat."

					"Kraken caviar: Incredibly rare and extremely expensive, only the richest of kings and emperors will ever be able to dine on the freshly laid eggs of a Kraken. These things are released en masse and grow rapidly to try and combat the multitude of oceanic predators that feed on their young. These must be caught and consumed less than 5 days after being laid. After that, if exposed to water, these regular looking roe will rapidly expand to the size of a cannonball and continue to absorb nearby water until it holds a pocket of water roughly 5ft in diameter."

					"Owlbear Steak: Very ‚Äògamey', but perfect for jerky. Plenty of meat on an Owlbear too."
				],
				[
					"49",
					"Roast Behir: The only way to enjoy the multi-legged dragon lookalike. After removing the electric glands and other organs, the meat of a Behir should be either smoked or roasted. Most adventurers miss out on the best flavour of this mountain dwelling creature. Properly cooked, Behir meat should have a taste reminiscent of the air after a lightning storm. Pairs well with cheese, oddly enough."

					"Fondgoo: An insane eccentric aspiring gourmet turned adventurer developed this after a horrific adventure in a ooze laboratory. Combining the jelly of a gelatinous cube with copious amounts of cheese and wine over high heat, you are able to neutralize most of the acidic elements to create an amazing dish. A mild anesthetizing effect tickles and numbs the mouth, preventing speech for a minute after consumption. Some consider this a boon and it is a frequent dish at many upper-class family reunions."
				],

					"69",
					"Flesh Fondgoo: Captured by a human from beyond the stars with an unnatural hunger, the chef only had servitude as a survival option. Becoming comforter and preparer of meals, the new take on the fondgoo proved to be delectable with the right ingredients. Thin slices of half-orc proved to be the most popular with the star cannibal and his crew, wildly rich with only mild game flavor from the mixed heritage. The gourmet would never admit it to anyone, but his refined palate preferred the gnoll. The terror only ended after discovering what they thought was a holy grail, a Hungering Flesh that went from cornucopia to consumer in no short order."

				],
				[
					"71",
					"Forever Stew: made with a bit of troll meat which is still regenerating. If managed carefully, one only needs to add vegetables and can continue making a meaty stew night after night, indefinitely. But if you don't eat it fast enough or fail to tend it properly, you could end up with recognizable troll bits (hands, eyes,...) starting to show up, or worse."

				[
					"74",
					"Flumph with Undersalmon: The tendrils of a dead flumph are removed, boiled on water along with the sanguine coloured fish commonly known as Undersalmon. It is served with Rice and Potatoes. This Dwarven dish has been since outlawed, with the discovery of the complexity of Flumph society. Although some still prepare it, as not only is it a delicious food, the psionic energy left on the meat brings joy to those who eat it."
				],
				[
					"75",
					"Neogi Neck: one of the few parts of the Neogi that are not poisonous, the Neogi's neck has tender meat and takes months to spoil. As such, it's often sought out by adventurers tired of eating the same old dried meat when on the road."
				],
				[
					"76",
					"Dry Stirge: this is a common folk food. In places with Stirge infestations, meat is often spoiled as these tiny creatures suck all of its blood and nutrients. Because of that, locals recur to it to replace their meat. The Stirge is prepared on a campfire, but because of the many types of blood that it sucks, it often leads to the eater contracting some sort of disease."

					"77",
					"Party meat: Nobody knows who had the terrifying idea of powdering sugar on Kruthik tissue, but certainly it was a madman. Or a genius, once you taste it and realise this abysmal combination is actually delicious. it's almost impossible to attend to a dwarven party without seeing this dish, commonly known as party meat."

				],
				[
					"81",
					"Hydra Eye Jelly: A delicacy among the braver class of adventurers, Hydra eyes became so highly acclaimed in part due to the might of their owners, but also due to the fact that you will generally get a minimum of ten for every Hydra killed. Cook in simmering water until they begin to cloud, then chill in an ice bath and mash before mixing with pork gelatin and allowing to solidify while chilled."

					"Pate of Elder Brain: A very difficult meat to acquire and tricky to prepare properly, Pate of Elder Brain is worth the work if you live to taste it. carefully remove all external tentacles and connective tissue before butchering, being careful of the internal connective tissue as you go. Cut into small pieces and place in a pot of water, slowly raise the temperature to medium until firm and blanch once cooked before blending. Ensure brain is really dead before preparing to butcher."

Butcher the ribs down small enough to fit into your ceramic oven and cook overnight in your favourite pork sauce, before revelling in the delicious taste of possibly the most amazing ribs you will ever taste."

					"Remorhaz Stew: Remorhaz is a wonderful meat for stews in that it retains heat forever! The Heat immune properties of the Remorhaz become fallible after their death, but they still require extremely high temperatures to be able to cook. Think smelting furnace, not oven. With such high temperatures required, Remorhaz needs to be cooked by eye due to the limited availability of such heat sources. Dice into evenly sized chunks and cook until very slightly crisp on the outside, tossing as you go before adding to a stew. Sufficiently heated Remorhaz meat will stay hot for hours, even up to a day or two, keeping any stew it is added to hot as long as you wish."

				[
					"87",
					"Roasted Bulette Flank: Bulette flesh is damnably tough and needs to be slow cooked with extreme patience. Combine red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, mustard, rosemary, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste to make a marinade. Cut the flank steaks off of the body and marinade them for at least a full day before roasting while continuously basting with the drippings. Once finished you will have a beautifully flavoursome and moist flank that while slightly gritty, is worth the effort of cooking it."
				],
				[
					"88",
					"Cave Fisher Sushi: As some of you may know, Cave Fisher blood ignites if exposed to flame or excess heat, therefore the best way to prepare it is to cut the meat into sushi sized pieces and drain as much blood as possible from the flesh before igniting and letting the excess blood burn off, lightly flaming the sushi for perfect preparation. Serve on Sushi rice with soy sauce."
				],
				[
					"89",
					"Forest Garbage Sauce: Anything you can use. Violet fungus, myconids, moss, mushrooms. Provides a hearty, earthy base. A secret: the sap of a treant, woad warrior, or blight is bitter. But together, simmer them. Put over any dark meat and find a bottle of dark, cheap red wine."

					"Demon Wing Soup: It's very spicy, and the wings are chewy, but there isn't a whole lot for a humanoid to eat in hell, so it works."
				],
				[
					"92",
					"Candied Quipper: One of the cheapest quick snacks around. Quippers taste uncompromisingly bitter and have an awful crunch to them. They still aren't very good once dipped in boiling tree sap, but at least they are covered in candy..."
				],
				[
					"93",
					"Honeyed Siren's Tongue: The tongue of a siren produces the most wonderful sound when chewed, bards will often accompany instrumental performances with the chewing of a Siren's tongue in order to woo crowds even further. Mixing it with honey makes it slightly easier to chew, but cooking it causes it to lose these magical effects."
				],

					"94",
					"Water Elemental Juice: The fluid harvested from a living water elemental has been known to retain effervescent properties after being harvested due to residual magic power left over in the collected sample.

					"Burritoes: Giant's toes are surprisingly rich in protein and healthy fats. Chop them, Sear them, cook two behir eggs in the left over grease, and create an excellent set of breakfast burritos. For a bit of added fun, they are best served on the toe nail."
				],
				[
					"99",
					"Rib-hirs: Behir's are nasty buggers, but they're good for one thing: ribs. The longest rib cage you will find, gather up your town, or the local goliath tribe, and you'll make a killing off of these. Flay the scales and smoke at a low heat over hickory logs for 2 days, slowly rotating the ribs through. A nice baste of dwarven ale mixed with citrus, or a rub of an orcish spice blend will make this a meal to remember. Just keep in mind the smell will travel for miles, so you might attract a nearby Roc."
				],
				[
					"100",
					"Roc Stock & Balor: While not actually made with Balor flesh, this demonic delicacy is as the name implies a stew made from Roc stock and any sort of demonic flesh. Due to the hellish nature of the flesh, the stew does not need any outside heat to work itself to a hearty temperature. Good for those in survivalist situations, assuming you can ignore the faint brimstone smell."
