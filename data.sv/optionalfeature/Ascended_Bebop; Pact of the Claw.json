				"Your patron gifts you a mote of their power that grafts itself upon your arm. One of your arms is transformed into an eldritch claw that takes an appearance reflective of your patron's nature. You can use this claw as a spellcasting focus and, as a bonus action whilst the claw is free, you can manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial so long as the object you're interacting with is within 15 feet of you, weighs less than 10 pounds. You cannot use magic items in this way.",
				"Additionally, as an action on your turn whilst the claw is free, you can use its power to summon a spectral copy of itself and hinder a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be {@condition grappled} by you, be pushed up to 10 feet away from you or pulled up to 10 feet towards you (your choice). As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by repeating the saving throw, ending the grapple on a success. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use the claw to grapple a different creature.",
