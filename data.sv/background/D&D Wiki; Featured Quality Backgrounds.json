But in a world filled with slavers, mad cults, dragons, walking dead, pit fiends, and extradimensional horrors, just about everyone could find a use for a psychotic sell-sword. Adventurers who survive and reach higher renown may find they have a small following of supporters or fans, but even they may cringe at the idea of that adventurer spending an evening in their home. Most adventurers by profession are members of an adventurers guild through which they can readily attain professional work and contacts in the field."

Perhaps it was a habit which you grew into, rather than something that ill-circumstances forced you into. You may have tended to a structure or building in several ways: cleaning, repairs, occasionally guarding, and so forth. Maybe you were employed by evildoers to clean up their dirty work, or maybe you overheard conversations within the imperial halls where you've worked. This kind of special environment may have been a starting point for your sense of adventure; but at heart, you simply began by being the local handyman.",

There are Cinderella figures, for example, who were doing chores their whole life until something prompted them to escape their life of drudgery to search for better horizons.
