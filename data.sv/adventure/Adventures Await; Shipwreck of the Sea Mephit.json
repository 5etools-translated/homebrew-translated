						"The Scattered Isles is a collection of small uninhabited islands between Lustra and Dennmarsh. Merchant ships often navigate the waters between the two ferrying goods to and from both cities. The journey is usually peaceful, although occasionally pirates do harass ships that stray too far from the normal shipping lanes. The weather in the isles can be a tad unpredictable at times, and it's not unheard of for a ship to go missing every now and then. This is part of what drives the cost of goods between the two port cities and makes the route such a profitable one. Many merchant ships also act as passenger vessels, turning excess storage and crew space into bunks for adventurers looking for quick and cheap transport across the sea. The characters find themselves onboard one such ship, the {@i Sea Mephit}. It's currently in the heart of the Scattered Isles making its way to Lustra first followed by Valhenge to the far south. No pirates have been seen, but there's a hint of a storm brewing on the wind and things can take a bad turn rather quickly out here on the sea."
