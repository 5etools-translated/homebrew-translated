Inside is a small paved floor that opens into a wide stone staircase. The building is little more than a covering over the stairs. Dwarves can easily see that the stone building is much newer than the steps; the walls and roof have stood for no more than two centuries, but the steps are at least four times that old; possibly even older.",

								"Note that the map is labeled with north at the bottom and south at the top. This is so you can more easily draw it correctly for the players without needing to continually flip it upside down.",
								"{@b Ceilings and Walls.} Although the catacombs are all excavated from earth and solid stone, the tunnels look nothing like a mine. Most walls and ceilings are either faced with smooth stone or have decorative features such as faux pillars, ledges, geometric designs, and scenes of life or religious themes carved into the stone.  Unless otherwise specified, the ceilings of the catacombs are only 10 feet high.",
								"{@b Crypts.} Most individual crypts are not described, because they're all basically the same. The walls are carved with loculi (niches) that contain either a single body or the stacked bones of many bodies. Most of these crypts aren't very interesting; they contain no treasure, no monsters, and no clues. Most of the bodies in a particular crypt are related somehow. Usually they're of the same family, but customs changed over the centuries: some crypts contain members of the same guild, or people of the same age, or people who died of the same causes or who served in the same military units. Characters should be less interested in what's inside individual crypts than by what's happening in the tunnels around them.",
								"{@b Light.} The catacombs are completely dark except where noted. Niches are carved into the walls every 20 feet for placement of oil lamps, but lamps aren't left in the niches. The faithful of Kelemvor bring lamps with them when they come into the catacombs. In a few places, open shafts have been dug from the catacombs to the surface to let in air and light. These are noted in text and on the map.",
								"{@b Sound.} The catacombs deaden sound effectively. For lack of a better phrase, the catacombs are, for the most part, as silent as the grave. Occasionally, dripping water can be heard. Open shafts for letting in air and light sometimes produce unsettling akin moaning or whistling on windy days. It is not unheard of to hear distant crying while in the catacombs, but it is attributed to those on in the graveyard, above, mourning their dead instead of any malevolence within the catacombs.",
								"{@b Undead.} The faithful of Kelemvor cleared all the undead out of these catacombs decades ago and kept the tunnels clear since then. However, due to the sheer size of the catacombs, the Red Wizard Rorreth Monforoth has had plenty of time to animate undead creatures from the crypts before their presence was prematurely discovered. Monforoth can't control all the undead he created, and some of them strayed into areas of the catacombs that allowed their discovery.",
								"{@b Water.} Most of the tunnels and crypts stay dry. There are puddles or even knee-deep water in some sections that stray beneath the Stojanow River.",
								"{@b Gates.} The gates are of sturdy and relatively new construction. Unless otherwise specified, the gates are locked and require a set of thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open. The gates may be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Doing so makes an obscene amount of noise, however."
