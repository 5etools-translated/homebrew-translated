									"No one truly knows when or how the false hydra came to be. It is an abomination, seen by few, and survived by fewer. Some say that is similar to a plant, that it grows from the ground like a sprout with no seed, that it germinates on lies and dishonesty. Others say that it is almost like a vicious fungus, a mindless life form that knows nothing beyond devouring and surviving. Some say they are the last vestiges of a curse from a fallen goddess, who sent them as punishment to the mortals who so conveniently turn their backs on inconvenient truths. In truth, scholars have no better idea. The few who believe in and attempt to study this creature have found little information about it, only aware of three things for certain: the false hydra sings, the false hydra grows, and the false hydra eats.",

This head, however, is pale, and hairless, with wet, eyeless sockets and a large mouth filled with broad, flat teeth. It finds itself buried deep beneath the earth near a settlement, and it grows. As it grows, it develops a fleshy, flabby torso, which serves as a \"root\". It is from this root that all further heads grow. The first head slowly pushes its way up through the dirt, breaking through the soil in the basement, beneath the stairs. Or beneath the brush around the house. Or through a broken cobblestone in the street. And then, when it has reached the surface, it sings."

To eat, it must stop singing. Thus, the first stage of a false hydra infestation is often the longest, as it waits for a lone victim to drag away into a basement, sewer, or small cave it has excavated for this purpose.",

The false hydra's victims become a part of the creature, and thus the creature's song erases all memories of him. Their absence will not be noticed. They are forgotten.

Any who pass them on the road are only temporarily taken under the false hydra's song, just long enough to forget they saw the lone traveler. When the carriers arrive in a new town, they find a spot to bury themselves and their head. When they do, the larva uses the carrier as it's first victim until it has grown enough to resurface. Then, the cycle begins anew, in a new town."

							"Due to the nature of the false hydra as a creature, it's rather hard to give the song a DC as a baseline to ignore it's effects. Thus, any creature who hears the song is under it's effect, but at the DM's discretion they can make an Intelligence saving throw to break the effect on themselves if they find something horrifying or strange enough to make them question reality. Consider the examples given in the <b>Mental Discord</b> section for things that might make players question their reality, or examples given in the original Goblin Punch article (<a href=https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/H1-2xqarKX>link at the bottom of the document</a>). Additionally, due to how the life cycle of the false hydra works, remember that only an elder false hydra can actually sing the song of domination, but any false hydra's song will continue the effect on someone under it's control, essentially transferring control to that false hydra. This will really only be used if a hydra grows big enough to have to spread to another town, as the false hydra's head will continue to sing to keep its host moving."
