					"A shield dwarf as tough as an ox and as stalwart as a stone wall, Jarhild straps on armor and shield to fight for the ones she considers friends. As a member of the Order of the Burning Dawn, she has the opportunity to protect the innocent and bring justice to the evil... and make a little coin doing it. She's wise, powerful, and experienced in battle tactics, and when the people she loves are threatened, there is little in this world that can withstand her fury.",
					"As a trained soldier, Jarhild is always prepared to do battle, be it on the front lines of a skirmish or the back room of a tavern. When not on the ready for imminent combat, however, she's ready to kick back and blow off steam with the rest of the hard-bitten warriors. She fights hard, and she plays hard, and woe be unto the poor soul who comments on the way she holds herself, the way she dresses, or the way she hefts her sword. As a dwarf who has faced down orc hordes, repelled incursions of giants, and even held fast against a dragon ambush, Jarhild doesn't feel a need to explain herself to anyone. She is who she is: a force to be reckoned with."
