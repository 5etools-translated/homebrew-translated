For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the hag's spell save DC to discern that the hag is disguised."

The results were monstrous beings that are almost alive, part fiend and part undead. Needless to say, Hrinruuk was very pleased with his creations, and he spread them throughout the realm. Physically, night-touched are very strange. In its natural state, their \"skin\" is extremely smooth, with an almost rubbery feel to it. It is always a deep midnight blue, aubergine, or obsidian color that seems to absorb any light that touches it. The night-touched have internal organs, but like those of undead creatures, they do not really function.

											"The death of the high elves' god did more than curse the elves, it virtually slew their spirits. Sorrow and melancholy have fallen upon the forsaken elves in the years since that fall. Their decline has been slow and painful, a dissolution becoming evident in their fragmented empire, decaying cities, shattered faith, and in their daily lives. In 57 AV, a group of elven artists, writers, wizards, and other creative individuals gathered and the city of Turen to discuss their plight. They agreed to assume responsibility for the rekindling the elves' spirits while preserving high elven heritage and culture. Artists from all of the elf realms were rallied and a renaissance movement began, bringing to an end the decades-long dearth of true elven culture. Along with their colleagues' murals, novels, poems, symphonies, sculptures, and architecture, the elven wizards presented new spells and magic items\u2014and their pièce de résistance, the remembrances: constructs tailored like beautiful high elves. The remembrances were designed as testament to erstwhile elven glory, animated cultural archives. Once, they mingled with elves, singing, dancing, reciting myths and legends or even re-enacting famous battles. Intended as keepers of all the joys and pleasures of elven lives and passions, they were intelligent, knowledgeable, and even fully capable of romantic and sexual activities."

The angry elves destroyed most of the renaissance works, including many of the remembrances. The riots continue to this day, and Pelegael survives amid violence and anarchy. After the movement faded, several remembrances secluded themselves in theaters and museums along with other pieces of art, where today they discreetly duplicate ancient masterpieces or pen old stories. Others wander as bards, disguising themselves as living elves. A few others live with sympathetic elven wizards or simply hide in the forests."

Yet, without a titan to command them, they were merely outcasts and liabilities in a world lorded over by gods. The marked still had potential in the Scarred Lands, though. Warrior-priests of Vangal recognized the marked's usefulness as envoys and messengers for their god - and as tools of destruction should disease and mayhem need to be delivered upon Vangal's enemies. The warrior-priests have therefore declared Chern's former pawns now Vangal's chosen\u2014representatives of the god who are not be molested or interfered with without invoking the Ravager's wrath. In truth, Vangal is probably disinterested in these pathetic souls, but they make fine political pawns for his true followers.
