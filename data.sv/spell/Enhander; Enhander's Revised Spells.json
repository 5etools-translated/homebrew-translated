Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes {@condition frightened} for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the {@condition frightened} creature's turns, it must make a Wisdom saving throw.  If it succeeds this saving throw for the third time, the effects of the spell end on it.  Otherwise, it takes {@damage 5d10} psychic damage."
