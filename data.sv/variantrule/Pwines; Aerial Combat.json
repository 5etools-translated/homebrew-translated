				"Occasionally, while on an adventure, one might find themselves a flying companion that they can ride into battle. Mighty dragon riders soar in the sky, battling their enemies on land and in the air. Majestic pegasus knights take their winged steeds into the air with them and battle evil that knows no bounds.",

						"When you are entering into an aerial battle, whether you are mounted or not, you rely on the single flying speed governing either yourself or your mount. When you are mounted, you likely cannot fly without your mount, therefore you have one movement between the two of you. However, this movement can be used on ither turn, or both turns if you have some movement speed left between turns."

					"entries": [
						"Aerial combat is a dangerous game of strategy and timing. One cannot attack a creature that is not within their range, so often it is beneficial, if not absolutely required for your mount to grapple with a creature to land any attacks (different rules apply for pegasuses, located at the end of this ruleset). The only exception to this rule is bows and ranged weapons, though using a ranged weapon in aerial combat always takes disadvantage unless guided by magic. However, when you are in a mid-air grapple you are unable to make any movement and will then fall from the sky. You must choose carefully the timing in which you grapple and attack a creature.",
						"Because of the restrictions of aerial combat and the need to grapple your target, altitude is almost always an advantage. When a creature is above another creature, they take advantage on grapple checks and saving throws against another creature. And a creature that is of a lower altitude takes disadvantage on all grapple checks and saving throws. Because of this, aerial combat is a dangerous game of strategy and precision. Because aerial combat often takes a long time, the two sides often attempt to ground their targets in any way possible, most often by atacking the opponent's wings."

						"A creature such as a dragon or pegasus, those that are typically ridden in aerial combat, are accustomed to flying, and can hold themselves up by their wings and the magics that allow such creatures to fly. During combat, a creature can use its move action to climb higher into the sky, or to reposition itself on the battlefield. If you are grappled in mid-air, as is necessary for aerial combat, you fall at a rate of 60 feet per round."

Typically a creature will be considered beaten when it reaches 20% of its hit point maximum, and at this point the creature will attempt to return to the ground so that it doesn't fall to its death.",
								"Out of self-preservation, a mount will typically return to the ground when it reaches the 20% mark, unless its rider doesn't allow it to reach the ground, make it clear to the players what is happening and the ramifications if they do not attempt to land safely.",
								"If a creature is grappled, then it very likely could become killed outright without being able to make this attempt. However, when a creature is incapacitated, they do not fall any faster than the 60 feet per round, so their rider may make attempts to stabilize their mount so that they can safely reach the ground."
