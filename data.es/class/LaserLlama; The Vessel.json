He fled the alleyway, leaving the charred remains of the brigands behind. They were but the latest victims of the dark presence he harbored within.",

She did not know why she was chosen, but within her soul was bound a fallen heavenly being, charged to perform one hundred and one good deeds in order to regain its status in the celestial courts. As the crowd gathered round, she said a prayer and gave herself over to the overwhelming radiance.",

The tower's keeper, a reclusive old archmage, only kept him around as a reminder of what would happen to any who dared cross him.
