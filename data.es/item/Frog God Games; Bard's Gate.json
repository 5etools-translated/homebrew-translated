If the character meets their quota for at least one month, the ring's magical effects and bonuses are restored as well as the lost hit points, but transmuted treasure is lost forever except as fertilizer",

If the ring is forcibly removed without the appropriate spell casting, the wearer continues to suffer all negative effects of the ring for five months, but gain none of the benefts until the ring is again worn.
