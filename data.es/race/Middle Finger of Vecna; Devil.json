He fed it fire, searing claws and head alike to nothingness in an instant and letting it tumble away into the rocky darkness below."

Their cunning and treachery allow devils to plan clever traps, playing on mortal fears and striking dangerous bargains to solidify power.",

Neutral fiends act as mercenaries, changing alliances whenever one side gains the advantage. The conflict is massive, spanning entire planes of reality, and hosting an immeasurable number of fiends.",

The yugoloths like to entertain the notion that the War is their own personal experiment into the nature of evil, one which they created and will ultimately end on their own terms. Other fiends have their own notions about the war, colored by their particular alignments and racial propaganda."

Devils love forming pacts with mortals who seek some benefit or prize, but those making those deals should be wary. Though a devil always honors the word of his contract, which is enforced by Asmodeous himself, they are ruthless negotiators and rarely miss a loophole in a contract. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.",
