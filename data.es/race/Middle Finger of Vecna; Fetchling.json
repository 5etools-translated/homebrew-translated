							"When we arrived at the appointed time, our guide was apparently absent. Jethro pontificated on the complexities about traveling the planes, even to one as near as the Plane of Shadow, and it was several minutes before we felt the presence of reflective eyes watching us from the shadows. When I noticed, I groped for my dagger and found only an empty sheathe. Jethro was disarmed of his bombs and we stood helpless, paralyzed for a moment.",
							"Our guide, a gaunt humanoid with grey skin and large, round eyes, stepped out of the shadows and presented us with our own weapons.",

Generation after generation in this insidiously dark place has infused the race with darkness and made them a bleak shadow of their kin. Gaunt features, pale skin, and eyes which reflect brightly at night, are all signature traits of fetchlings, and it is not uncommon for the unlearned to mistake them for undead.",

To see a fetchling apart from the Plane of Shadow is to see an outsider to your plane, or a recent descendant of one.",
							"Fetchlings can find lucrative business as merchants, middlemen, and guides for those seeking to cross the planar boundaries. They can comfortably exist in both planes, and are reasonably well acquainted with the hazards, however, they are accepted by the denizens of the planes almost nowhere."

Only when pursued or outnumbered is a fetchling likely to seek concord with others for any length of time. After the danger has passed, they rarely stick around, and have a reputation for simply vanishing into the night."
