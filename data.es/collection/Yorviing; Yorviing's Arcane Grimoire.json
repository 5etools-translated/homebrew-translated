Dentro de estas páginas, encontrarás muchas Tradiciones Arcanas para magos, múltiples hechizos, objetos mágicos, tablas de tiradas, trasfondos y mucho, mucho más.",

Hay subclases para magos (e incluso algunas que no son para magos) para crear personajes, hechizos para otorgar a los hechiceros y a los portadores de magia, objetos mágicos que se pueden encontrar, comprar o regalar a los jugadores, tablas de tirada para ayudar a dar cuerpo a la historia de fondo, la personalidad y la visión del mundo de un personaje, e incluso facciones neutrales de ambientación que un Dungeon Master puede incorporar a su mundo o a una campaña, ya sea como una preexistente o como una que los jugadores quizás se esfuerzan por crear o traer de vuelta.",

He estado trabajando para dar vida a este proyecto, probando, revisando y editando todo lo que he podido para presentar un compendio de homebrew que merezca la pena.",

Sin ellos, este proyecto no existiría, y tengo que agradecer a todos ellos este viaje (puedes encontrar más información sobre los que me ayudaron en la Parte 10 de este libro).",
						"El Grimorio Arcano de Yorviing está dedicado a unas cuantas personas diferentes.",
						"En primer lugar, este libro está dedicado a mi esposa Chelsea, sin la cual no habría tenido el ánimo y la alegría de continuar con este proyecto cuando pasé por algunos momentos oscuros. Te quiero, cariño.",
						"En segundo lugar, este libro está dedicado a los miembros de los mejores jugadores que he tenido el placer de dirigir en un mundo casero llamado \"Yvarra\": Ben, Brandy, Chris, Dan, Kevin, Korrigan, Mallory, Nathan, Shelly y Tate. Algún día volveremos.",
						"En tercer lugar, este libro está dedicado al subreddit r/UnearthedArcana por todos sus comentarios y apoyo, así como a todos los que me siguen en Reddit. Seguid elaborando.",
						"Por último, quiero decir que, aunque he dedicado mucho tiempo y energía al contenido de este libro, no cabe duda de que habrá cosas que no estarán totalmente equilibradas y perfectas. Aunque he podido probar y perfeccionar muchos de los contenidos de este libro, hay cosas que se me escapan. Espero que cualquiera que pruebe cualquier cosa en este libro, desde subclases hasta hechizos, me haga saber a través de Reddit cualquier comentario que obtenga, desde lo positivo hasta la crítica constructiva.",

								"La Quantumurgia es una nueva escuela de magia, fuertemente influenciada e inspirada por la mecánica, las propiedades y las teorías que prevalecen dentro de la física cuántica y la mecánica cuántica. Muchos de estos hechizos se inspiran en un fenómeno particular de la mecánica cuántica, como el túnel cuántico, y otros se inspiran en propiedades de la tecnología atómica y nuclear.",
								"Esta escuela de magia está pensada para servir como un estilo de magia más \"futurista\", aunque aunque estará más a gusto en un entorno o mundo de ciencia ficción o futurista, puede utilizarse en mundos de fantasía medieval estándar, así como en una rama de la magia recién descubierta.",
								"Cuando la Quantumurgia se implementa en escenarios futuristas, se puede hacer que sea tan común como otras formas de magia, como la evocación o la transmutación. Incluso puede haber una rica tradición de magos cuánticos que se consideren iguales a los abjuradores o conjuradores. La quantumurgia puede verse como una forma de entender las energías arcanas que se encuentran en los niveles subatómicos del universo y de todas las cosas, y por ello puede dar lugar a interpretaciones tanto académicas como místicas de cómo se utiliza y estudia esta escuela de magia.",
								"Cuando la Quantumurgia se implementa en entornos más antiguos, de estilo medieval, esta escuela de magia puede verse como una forma de magia recién descubierta con la que los hechiceros se han topado, o incluso puede ser una magia antigua, olvidada hace tiempo, que seres de otro mundo pueden transmitir a aquellos que buscan el poder que reside en la quantumurgia. Tal vez esta magia se concede como una bendición especial a un brujo que ha servido bien a su patrón. O tal vez la quantumurgia es una escuela de magia que sólo ha sido descubierta por los magos, por lo que sólo los magos pueden tener acceso a estos hechizos.",
								"Actualmente, estos hechizos no están listados para ninguna clase en particular aparte del mago. Hay dos razones para esto. La primera es que esta escuela es una escuela más académica, y por lo tanto puede adaptarse mejor a los magos y potencialmente a los brujos. La segunda razón es para que un DM que utilice quantumurgia en su entorno o mundo pueda tener la libertad de interpretar esta escuela de magia, y cómo funciona mejor con lo que está dirigiendo.",

								"{@i Of all the wonders I have seen in my life, none have struck me with a sense of awe more than that of the Ovriel Academy. The first time I laid my eyes upon its multitude of spires, its grand halls, and the rooms upon rooms where all manner of magical experimentation and learning was taking place, my breath was taken away from me. Never has there been an institution so dedicated to the discovery and learning of all things magical. From its lowest levels to its highest towers, students of the arcane were toiling away over ancient tomes, beakers filled with strange liquids and gases, and inscribing spells and sigils upon all manner of materials. My guide, the dear Elistra Alixandre, as part of my tour of the grand keep, took me through a maze of hallways and corridors to a large lecture hall deep underground, where we sat in earnest and wonder at a presentation in which an old orcish wizard displayed his findings on the works of the Yune, the greatest wizard in the land. After which, Elistra showed me a room where students were learning how to summon corpses. Corpses! I was told that no magic is off limits in the Academy to study, so long as it follows particular guidelines. I was amazed at the level of variety and splendid magics that I saw there, and am eagerly looking forward to the day where I can return as a student myself.}",

								"La Academia Ovriel está considerada por muchos como la mayor institución de aprendizaje mágico jamás creada. Adherida a una ideología progresista de \"cualquier aprendizaje mágico es un buen aprendizaje mágico\", la Academia ha sido el hogar de muchos de los mejores magos del mundo. Dentro de sus muros de piedra antigua y desgastada, los estudiantes pueden estudiar y practicar cualquier escuela o forma de magia, con sólo un pequeño número de restricciones que deben ser respetadas.",
								"La aceptación por parte de la Academia de la magia de todo tipo y origen ha llevado a la creación de increíbles e influyentes obras de comprensión y teoría arcana. Desde obras que discuten los elementos más finos de manejar el poder del fuego, hasta una serie de experimentos documentados que detallan los métodos de cómo obtener un amplio conocimiento del futuro, los estudiantes, instructores y ex alumnos de la Academia son anunciados como los más poderosos magos y estudiosos de lo arcano vivos.",
								"Sin embargo, aunque la tolerancia de la Academia hacia una variedad de magia no tiene precedentes en el mundo de los académicos arcanos, hay quienes ven esta forma de pensamiento y experimentación progresista como algo que va demasiado lejos, o quizás sea demasiado peligroso. Los críticos de la Academia afirman que permitir la práctica de artes oscuras como la nigromancia o incluso la \"guerra de la carne\", además de la instrucción clásica de hechizos de naturaleza destructiva o manipuladora, permite albergar a individuos retorcidos y potencialmente peligrosos que sólo se hacen más fuertes y poderosos. La Academia, sin embargo, ha seguido negando esto, afirmando que es precisamente esta forma de tolerancia abierta hacia la magia la que evitará el uso y la ejecución inadecuados de la magia peligrosa.",

								"{@i After a four day journey into the heart of the ancient Yorn Forest, my companion Alain and I finally came upon a clearing that lay nestled between mighty great-pines that shot upwards into the sky hundreds of feet above us. There, we saw who we were hoping to meet; a witch, adorned in furs and dark grey cloaks. Her right hand gripped a long quarterstaff, upon which feathers and bones hung from a jagged crystal tip. Her hair, thick and wild like that of the mane of a black lion, obscured much of her face, though through that darkened canopy I could see her eyes. The two haunting yellow eyes shone curiously bright, and as the first few drops of rain began to fall from the sky, her left hand emerged from within her cloak, beckoning us into the heart of the forest. \"Come,\" she began, \"let me show you what the world has forgotten.\"}",

								"Witch Covens are a mysterious and ancient part of history. Many live in wild remote areas, practicing ancient and taboo magic deep within darkened woods or haunted deserts. Others live just beyond the edge of civilization, close enough to offer their services to those who seek it while at the same time far enough away to maintain a life of peace. A witch coven may be harsh and cruel to outsiders, tricking them into terrible curses or misfortune should they not be careful of their dealings and wording. Some covens, however, are more generous and kind, serving as a voice of wisdom and council to small villages and hamlets.",
								"Despite this drastic variety of covens, all witches adhere to two basic principles, which some covens refer to as the Rule of Two: the acquiring and protecting of ancient magic and magical secrets, and the Code of Covens. To the former, all witch covens maintain a connection to special magic, and make sure that it does not fall into the wrong hands. The magic that a coven can hold and protect can be as varied as the covens themselves, though all covens protect their secrets from all outsiders, and occasionally from other covens as well. To the latter, all witch covens work together under a set of ancient laws known as the Code of Covens. It is through these laws that witches have each other's backs in times of peace or peril.",
								"Yet, even with their mystical abilities and ancient knowledge, all witches know that the world can be as dangerous as it can be peaceful. Witches exist in a constant state of in between do to the nature of an outsiders view on them. Cultures with strong ties to magic or nature may have a more respectful and favorable view on witches, valuing their knowledge, wisdom, and combined powers of nature and the arcane. While on the other hand, some civilizations and cultures may view witches, regardless of their coven's practices, as heretics and bad omens, and may even lead crusades, inquisitions, or witch hunts to purge the land from what they view as an impurity.",

										"With so many different covens, it does not take a very scrutinous eye to see that there is no unified leader amongst the lot of them. The only unifying tie that all covens share are the unanimous upholding of the Rule of Two. Some covens keep to themselves, while others will communicate openly between other sister covens. Occasionally, there are instances where all witch covens gather together for a common goal. Such a goal could be uniting to fight against a zealous inquisition, or because of a rare magical event, such as a Bloodmoon or the sprouting of an ancient tree.",
										"Below are a handful of sample covens that can be used within a world. These examples will give a basic description of the coven, their style of magic, and their general attitudes.",
										"{@b Coven of Lies.} The Coven of Lies is one of the most feared covens in the land. Witches who belong to this coven often summon great spiders to aid them in battle, and are known for their use of deadly poisons. What makes them dangerous, however, is their ability to move stealthily and to be patient. Many witches in this coven use spiders to spy upon others, seeing through the eyes of a spider while it sits patiently in the webs in the corners of dark rooms or forests.",
										"{@b Coven of Might.} The Coven of Might lives up to their namesake by training in the art of combat and acquiring power through whatever means necessary. These witches will often hone their skills in weaponry, and may even don armor in warfare. Their greatest strength, however, comes from their ability to draw allies to their cause and to have others work alongside of them. Great minotaur and mighty beasts will follow these witches to achieve whatever goal they are after.",
										"{@b Coven of Oak.} The Coven of Oak is one that practices what is known as ‘green magic', a type of magic that controls and wields the magical strength of nature itself. Often one of the more peaceful covens, witches within this group tend to wild areas of nature and help protect it. They get along more easily with druids than some other witch covens may, and they are known to be guardians of ancient natural sites, such as mighty old trees or an oasis within a vast desert.",
										"{@b Coven of Light.} The Coven of Light is one of the more recognized covens, and favorably so. Many of these witches will offer their services to heal and help others with their ailments, wounds, or other aspects of their lives. They are often the coven that will live the closest to civilization, and in some cases small hamlets will even spring up around their settlements to protect them in exchange for their aid. These witches are sometimes known as ‘good witches' or ‘witch-doctors'.",
										"{@b Coven of Seas.} The Coven of Seas is one of the more nomadic covens, and they travel either on the oceans or journey up the lengths of coasts as the seasons change. They are practitioners of ancient oceanic magic, often using salt, seaweed, and shells in their rituals and spellcasting. They can be as unpredictable as the sea itself, offering aid and guidance through rivers or stormy seas, or can be malevolent deceivers, guiding many a would be voyage to their doom amongst the depths.",
