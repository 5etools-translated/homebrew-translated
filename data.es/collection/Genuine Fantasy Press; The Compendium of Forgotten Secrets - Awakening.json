Al culminar el evento, el hechicero cortará la punta de un dedo y colocará una sola gota de sangre en la sombra, infundiéndole vida, alma y obediencia a su creador."

Los hechiceros que han jurado al Gato de las Sombras a menudo los toman como familiares, normalmente tratando al dimcat como una extensión de su propio patrón. En cierto sentido, lo son realmente: cada dimcat es un reflejo del Shadowcat que se creó cuando esta enigmática entidad consumió y convirtió una pesadilla menor, transformando el viejo horror en una nueva forma con un nuevo propósito.",

Tienen una interesante rivalidad con los cazadores de registros del Archivo, y tratan de salvaguardar sus secretos para que no sean catalogados de una forma tan mundana como la literatura. En su lugar, consideran que las tradiciones orales son la forma más elevada de conocimiento, y tratan de compartirlas en los sueños que visitan en las noches de luna llena.",

Con ellos, llamó a los mares para que se elevaran por encima de la tierra y se tragaran todo el planeta, aunque los artefactos fueron destruidos en el proceso. Aquel día murieron miles de personas, y las que quedaron vivieron entre los cadáveres y el oleaje en las cimas de las montañas más altas. Con el paso del tiempo, la inquebrantable influencia del Custodio sobre el mundo se hizo cada vez mayor, convirtiendo a los que antes eran nobles en imitaciones de sí mismos. Realizaban rituales sobre los muertos, tomando la carne de sus caídos y consumiéndola ellos mismos. Ofrecían sus cuerpos y mentes rotas al Custodio, y éste se hacía cada vez más poderoso.",
					"Al final, descubrió que escuchar los susurros de aquellos que lo adoraban era placentero, por lo que dirigió su mente hacia las antiguas y perdidas artes que permitían esculpir la vida a partir de la carne y la sensibilidad a partir de los sueños. Así nacieron los vigilantes sin ojos, que siempre susurran los secretos de los que han venido y se han ido para el entretenimiento de su amo inhumano."

Cuando están en reposo, tienden a descansar sobre los hombros de sus amos y miran amenazadoramente a los que les rodean.

Antes de que la presa pueda reaccionar, el segundo cae con la fuerza de un rayo, matando a la bestia al instante. Entonces los dos se posarán sobre el cuerpo hasta que la nieve le quite el calor, y comenzarán su festín cuando la sangre comience a congelarse.",

Los corceles pueden llevar, y los sabuesos pueden disfrutar del afecto del amo, pero los halcones fueron los primeros, y los halcones serán los últimos. Su orgullo les llevará a realizar hazañas aparentemente imposibles de valentía casi suicida, como arrancar los ojos a los hechiceros y lanzarse a la garganta de los dragones para hendirlos con sus afiladas alas."

					"La cobra imperial es una de las serpientes venenosas más mortíferas, y su linaje ha sido infundido con la magia de la Emperatriz Serpiente, otorgándoles el habla y la astucia. Nacidas de un largo linaje criado para ser espías, asesinos y ayudantes de los cortesanos, estas cobras son maliciosas y taimadas. Su veneno es potente y está impregnado de una poderosa magia que le permite dañar incluso a quienes están protegidos contra esas toxinas. Cuando están en reposo, buscan animales pequeños, como ratas o pájaros, y los atormentan para entretenerse, inyectándoles gradualmente pequeñas cantidades de veneno hasta que la criatura muere en una horrible agonía. Estas cobras disfrutan de la adulación y de los juegos de ingenio y azar, y aceptan alegremente regalos de piedras preciosas, joyas, espejos, carnes exóticas y huevos de reptiles y aves por igual.Invocar a una cobra imperial es más fácil de decir que de hacer. Los conjuros y expresiones adecuadas son difíciles de pronunciar sin una lengua bífida, por lo que rara vez lo hacen quienes no son siervos de la emperatriz. A medida que avanza el ritual, el invocador debe inscribir una pequeña marca en forma de colmillo en su mano antes de sostenerla sobre el fuego de un brasero, ofreciéndosela a la cobra. La bestia emergerá del fuego inicialmente como una serpiente de llamas verdes, enroscándose y siseando con intenciones maliciosas. La serpiente en llamas golpeará la mano ofrecida, quemando una fina línea a través del colmillo inscrito. Si el invocador mantiene la calma y la quietud durante este proceso, tendrá éxito en el rito, dotando a la serpiente de vida y haciendo que se vuelva corpórea. Si expresa emoción o dolor, una toxina agonizante inundará sus venas y el ritual se interrumpirá.",

Sirve a su amo como un igual, sometido sólo a sus deseos por el hecho de la magia que los une más que por cualquier lealtad verdadera. El juramento de una serpiente significa poco, excepto cuando se hace al gobernante del Imperio Interminable."

Cuando su carga se ve amenazada, se sacrifican de buen grado, como estaba dispuesto a hacer el Exiliado, tratando de salvar a su camarada caído a costa de sus propias vidas. Sin embargo, aún conservan la chispa de desprecio por la mortalidad que tuvo su creador, y atacan con una luz malévola cada vez que presencian la caída de un enemigo mortal. Invocar un fragmento luminoso es bastante sencillo, en comparación con otros familiares. Sólo hay que ponerse delante del brasero, encenderlo y hablar apasionadamente de algo que se desea o de algo que se ha perdido. Las lenguas de fuego comenzarán a arder en un cálido color azul y dorado mientras se unen para formar una figura humanoide. El invocador debe entonces ofrecer suavemente una mano y ayudar a la pequeña entidad a salir del brasero. Al salir, se solidificará en un fragmento luminoso. El invocador debe entonces declarar su propósito en la vida, tal y como lo ve en ese momento. Si es sincero, el fragmento le jurará lealtad con una serie de gestos y le servirá fielmente como familiar a partir de entonces. Si es engañoso, el fragmento derramará una lágrima de cristal fundido, se romperá en fragmentos y se unirá al Exilio en los cielos."

Invocar a un pájaro cantor sinfónico implica cantar, como es de esperar. Se enciende el brasero, se quema el incienso y el invocador debe iniciar una melodía de su propia creación. Hay que hacerlo con cuidado, para que haya espacio para que otro armonice sin interrupciones ni trastornos, y suele ser difícil para los novatos. Una vez que la canción llega al momento correcto, el fuego dentro del brasero se fusionará en la imagen de un pájaro cantor, y comenzará a cantar junto con su nuevo amo. El invocador debe continuar su canto hasta un cierre apropiado, guiando al pájaro fuera del brasero al mismo tiempo. Una vez que haya emergido por completo y sea corpóreo, el hechicero debe terminar la canción y decir su nombre. El pájaro cantor sinfónico repetirá perfectamente el nombre, y luego dirá el suyo. Cuando el hechicero haga lo mismo y pronuncie el nombre del pájaro cantor en una imitación exacta, se formará el vínculo entre el familiar y el maestro."

					"El dinero, un elemento mortal que acecha en los bolsillos de innumerables santos y villanos por igual, es una herramienta que trae tanto la salvación como la miseria. Sin embargo, no todos los fondos son de fiar. La Conspiración de la Moneda ha ido sustituyendo gradualmente las monedas originales del mundo por karensee, conocidas coloquialmente como imitaciones de riqueza. Pueden adoptar un número infinito de formas, pero están restringidas, a diferencia de sus parientes mayores. Estos imitadores sólo pueden elegir convertirse en objetos que parezcan tener valor. Una moneda de oro, un billete, una piedra preciosa, un collar de perlas: todas estas cosas son potenciales imitadores de la riqueza. La mayoría de ellos están dormidos, atrapados en una forma singular. Fingen daños u otros efectos nocivos mientras duermen, comportándose exactamente como materiales naturales. Sin embargo, cuando son despertados por la magia eldritch, cobran vida y atacan a quienes pretendían poseerlos. Los miembros de la conspiración de la Moneda suelen llamar y despertar a los imitadores de la riqueza mediante un rito ritual, pero cualquier brujo con suficiente poder y conocimiento puede invocar uno.",
					"Los primeros pasos son relativamente fáciles. El invocador debe encender el brasero y situarse junto a él, pronunciando los conjuros correctos. Una vez que el fuego se haya reducido a brasas, el invocador debe introducir un único objeto de valor que un imitador de la riqueza pueda imitar, como una moneda o un billete de banco.",
					"A continuación, el brujo debe ofrecer sangre. Cuando se apliquen unas gotas al objeto dentro del brasero, las llamas volverán a cobrar vida, consumiendo el objeto y desapareciendo después. Las cenizas comenzarán a formarse juntas en una forma idéntica a la del objeto, y nacerá un nuevo imitador de la riqueza. Pronunciará una sola palabra, dándose un nombre. Mientras su amo conozca ese nombre, obedecerá perfectamente, cambiando de forma y matando a la orden.",
					"Los imitadores de la riqueza disfrutan alimentándose de otra moneda. Algunos estudiosos susurran que esto pretende darles poder, pero otros sospechan que simplemente son caníbales por naturaleza. Se cree que los miembros de la Conspiración crearon a los imitadores de la riqueza con una medida de seguridad incorporada, por si algo sale mal en el plan final. En ese caso, se consumirían unos a otros en un frenesí después de ser privados de otra carne, haciéndolos inofensivos para los que no pudieran alcanzar."

Contra los enemigos más pequeños que él, el cubo se abalanzará sobre ellos e intentará engullirlos y consumirlos. Hablan a las mentes que les rodean con una inocencia infantil incluso cuando se dan un festín de mortales y bestias muertas por igual.

It grants you the power to use your art to perform feats of incredible magic, and to paint beauty and ugliness alike upon the fabric of reality. This freedom often has hideous consequences, as you are forever tormented by the demands of that horrible self that lurks within your painted mirror. You are not yourself.
