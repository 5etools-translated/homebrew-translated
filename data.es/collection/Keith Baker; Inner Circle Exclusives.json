						"The Unity of Riedra is a single political entity. It's one nation. But it's made up of eight provinces, and each of these provinces were once unique nations. Those nations were shaped by environmental factors, by religions, arcane discoveries, and most of all, by {@i planar influences}. While they are now unified\u2014and while the Inspired work to discourage any strong sense of provincial nationalism in modern Riedra\u2014understanding these fallen nations is crucial both to understanding the landscape of Riedra, the history of the Five Nations, and the secrets or wonders that adventurers might travel to Riedra to uncover. RIEDRA may be one nation, but you'll have very different adventures in Borunan and Ohr Kaluun.",
						"{@i Secrets of Sarlona} implies that the old kingdoms were fairly advanced\u2014that they had wizards, sorcerers, divine champions. If so, why did these techniques not travel to Khorvaire? And in general, why don't the Five Nations show their Sarlonan roots more strongly? We've said that while most followers of the Sovereign Host in the Five Nations know that their faith is \"the Pyrinean Creed,\" very few actually know that this means it originated in the Sarlonan nation of Pyrine. Why have these nations been forgotten?",
						"There's two important factors. The first is that the Sarlonan \"settlers\" of Khorvaire weren't the paragons and pride of their nations. We've called out that Lhazaar was a {@i pirate}, and it's no accident that her lieutenant Malleon was known as \"The Reaver.\" Many of those who followed Lhazaar were outlaws, renegades, or rebels of one brand or another. Later waves of colonization were largely driven by refugees. These weren't organized efforts to preserve the culture and achievements of the old kingdoms. Equally important is the fact that they {@i couldn't} transport many of their greatest achievements, which is another reason why there weren't more active programs driving colonization. Because one thing Sarlona has in greater amounts than any other continent is planar influence. Manifest zones, wild zones, reality storms, and more\u2014Sarlona is {@i closer to the planes} than Khorvaire. This creates both threats and opportunities. Depending on their traits, manifest zones and wild zones can be extremely dangerous\u2014but as seen in Sharn, Shae Mordai, and Dreadhold, they can also enable wonders that can't be replicated in the mundane world. Manifest zones can be a source of unusual flora, fauna, or other resources. The drug known as {@i absentia} is created using a root that grows in certain Xoriat manifest zones, while the pomow plant\u2014the mainstay of the Riedran diet\u2014was developed in Lamannian zones. Beyond this, the more powerful zones leak planar energies into the surrounding region. This can be tapped to produce magical effects, and can also subtly shape the personality of mortals. Creatures that live in the vicinity of a Shavarath wild zone are more likely to be aggressive\u2014and to have an instinctive knack for developing martial skills. So the wizards of Khunan and the sorcerers of Corvagura were channeling planar magic... and when Khunan wizards fled to what's now Valenar, they found that {@i their magic didn't work there.} So the reason the Five Nations don't seem to be that much more advanced than the fallen kingdoms of Sarlona is because they had to {@i rebuild} their arcane science... in the process, creating forms of magic that are more reliable and versatile. Nonetheless, it is possible that adventurers sifting through the ruins of the old kingdoms may find rituals, relics, or spells that are a match or even superior to modern techniques... though it might take the skill of an exceptional arcanist\u2014or a player character\u2014to adapt these techniques to the modern style! {@i (Side note for the Arcana-proficient: the old Sarlonan style of magic\u2014drawing on planar energies\u2014is referred to as \"Externalist\" or \"wielding external forces.\" The most common form of arcane science employed by the Five Nations is \"Siberyan,\" and manipulates energies exuded by the Ring of Siberys.)}",
						"So what follows focuses on aspects not covered in {@i Secrets of Sarlona}: the impact of the planes and interesting aspects of the old cultures. But always remember that the Inspired have worked to suppress the old traditions. In particular, the {@b Edgewalkers} are an elite order tasked to protect innocents from extraplanar threats, and one of their major duties is patrolling the borders of wild zones. Many zones do contain deadly threats; but in other cases the Inspired don't want the locals to find ways to use the zones as their ancestors did, or to be influenced by the zone.",
						"Note that manifest zones to all planes (save Dal Quor) can be found anywhere in Riedra. What are called out in these sections are the most common and powerful planar influences in a region, and the common {@i wild zones}. But manifest zones to Thelanis can be found in any province, for example; in the novel {@i The Gates of Night}, the protagonists travel between Xen'drik and Sarlona using manifest zones tied to Thelanis.",

								"In the days of the old kingdoms, the ogres of Borunan were peerless warriors. The champions of Borunan possessed inhuman strength, martial discipline, unshakeable courage, and weapons forged in Fernian flame. Time and again, they repelled the legions of Nulakesh and the crusaders of Khalesh, and yet Borunan never sought to conquer any of its neighbors. Some might wonder why this was. Borunan is a harsh land; did the ogres never consider claiming the more fertile fields of Nulakesh? What kept their population so low that they never needed to expand?",
								"It's commonly known that the people of Borunan considered their neighbors to be \"unworthy foes\" and the common assumption was that the ogres were cruel brutes who constantly fought one another. In fact, the ogres were waging a truly divine war\u2014fighting alongside angels in an endless struggle against devils. The center of Borunan contains a wild zone to Shavarath where a fragment of the Eternal Battleground extends directly into the material plane, and the ancient ogres devoted their might not to conquest, but to defending this keep against the forces of tyranny.",
								"Borunan contains multiple wild zones tied to {@b Fernia} and {@b Shavarath}, along with multiple passages into {@b Khyber}. The forerunners of the ogres emerged from a demiplane within Khyber; tectonic activity destroyed this passage, leaving them stranded in this barren region of rocky desert and hills. Of the Shavaran wild zones, only the one\u2014known to the ogres as {@i Gul Dol,} the Gate of War\u2014is a direct passage to the Eternal Battleground. But the ogres built their fortresses in the other Shavaran zones, and over generations the influence of Shavarath helped shape them into fierce warriors. The origin of the oni is a secret long forgotten, but one possibility is this: just like the rakshasa and the overlords, the immortals of Shavarath cannot be permanently bound. But during their service in Gul Dol, the champions of Borunan found a way to bind defeated fiends to their own bodies\u2014sort of an involuntary version of the process that created the kalashtar, trapping a fiend within a bloodline of ogres. Thus the supernatural powers of the oni may be tied to the essence of devils bound to the bloodlines. This could be why many oni are drawn toward evil; but the oni of Borunan resisted those sinister instincts, using the power of their defeated foes to fight alongside celestials.",
								"In addition to being fierce warriors, the oni of Borunan forged their weapons in the {@b Cauldron}, a wild zone tied to Fernia. Their weapons weren't as well-crafted as the arms and armor of the Dhakaani, but the oni spell-smiths were able to channel the energies of Shavarath and Fernia to imbue their creations with powerful magic. While most of these weapons were destroyed long ago\u2014not to mention being designed to be wielded by ogres and oni\u2014legendary items or even artifacts could remain in Gul Dol, the Cauldron, or other ancient ruins.",
								"The ogres of ancient Borunan cared nothing for the Sovereigns or the Silver Flame. They were entirely devoted to the battle for Gul Dol. The angels of the Legion of Freedom battle the devils of the Legion of Tyranny for control of this massive fortress, which is broken into multiple rings and wings. The angels believe that the balance of this war reflects the balance between tyranny and freedom across the multiverse. Of course, this is only one of countless fronts in the eternal war between these forces, but the ogres embraced this idea and believed that in fighting alongside the angels they were fighting for freedom for all people.",

The humans of the surrounding regions had long feared the ogres, and it was easy for the quori to fan these flames. Within Borunan itself, the quori sowed doubts and created feuds, shattering centuries of unity. {@i Were the oni secretly in league with devils? Was the battle for Gul Dol a pointless sacrifice?} Civil strife decimated Borunan and left it vulnerable to outside attack."

										"In the present day, the ogres of Borunan are kept from the wild zones that served as the strongholds of their ancestors, and largely kept from any form of war; they use their strength for manual labor as opposed to battle. The oni are raised to believe in a twisted form of their actual history. Riedran oni are taught that their gifts are the result of being living prisons for fiends; it is the duty of the oni to redeem the fiend within them through their own devoted service to the Inspired. Largely, this has proven successful, and the Horned Guard\u2014an elite corps of oni soldiers\u2014is one of the most powerful weapons in the Riedran arsenal. However, over the course of the last two decades a group of Borunan rebels has been forming a resistance movement, the Horned Shadow, that seeks to protect the ogre-kin (ogres, oni, eneko). This is still a young movement, struggling to build power while avoiding the gaze of the Thousand Eyes. It's up to the DM to decide if the Horned Shadow is entirely heroic\u2014a throwback to the champions of ancient Borunan, who devoted their lives to defending freedom from tyranny\u2014or if the oni leaders are driven by fiendish impulses and have malevolent goals."

										"Borunan has many passages to Khyber. These could provide ways for adventurers to cross from Khorvaire into Riedra, intentionally or by accident. This could also be a vector that could bring the minions of a daelkyr into Riedra. The Edgewalkers monitor these passages, and have sealed those that can be sealed. The public is kept away from the wild zones that hold the ancient ruins of Borunan, and believe them to be the domain of foul {@i altavars} (the Riedran term for fiends). The two most powerful zones are the Cauldron (a Fernian zone in the Broken Blade Mountains and the seat of old Borunan's oni spell-smiths) and Gul Dol. Today, the majority of the Gate of War is in the hands of the Legion of Tyranny, but the angels still hold an isolated keep. Their forces include a number of Borunan sword wraiths\u2014the spectral vestiges of the ogrekin champions that fought and died alongside them.",
										"The ogres of Borunan are generally more intelligent than their cousins in Droaam, with an average Intelligence of 9. It's likely that the ancestors of the ogres and oni of Khorvaire were transported by a planar anomaly; this might explain their reduced Intelligence and the lack of any Borunan traditions. Another possibility is that the ogres of Khorvaire are a separate branch of the species\u2014that they came from the same demiplane but emerged in Khorvaire instead of Sarlona, and were untouched by the influence of Shavarath."

The influence of wild zones tied to Mabar and Thelanis are largely contained by the Edgewalkers; the {@b Shanjueed Jungle} has been called out as the largest Mabaran manifest zone in Eberron, dwarfing even the Gloaming of the Eldeen Reaches. Lamannian wild zones and manifest zones have been tapped to contribute to the agricultural programs of Riedra; this includes the creation of unusual hybrids, such as the pomow plant. As the Inspired keep people out of the wild zones and work to contain their influence, plane-touched sorcerers are rarely born in Corvagura. People know what to watch for and {@i know} that such sorcerers are vessels for altavars (evil spirits), responsible for chaos and bloodshed in the days before the Unity, and sorcerers identified by the Thousand Eyes will either be killed or forced into service with the Edgewalkers. However, as with other provinces, there may well be a few who have managed to conceal their powers or who managed to flee into wild zones and survive there\u2014rebels who could assist player characters. On the other hand, some such sorcerers have internalized the teachings that these powers are the gifts of fiends, and believe that the path to greater power lies in performing vile acts; such criminals are exceedingly dangerous. It's worth noting that while the sorcerer-princes of ancient Corvagura were human, there's nothing stopping a Corvaguran changeling, shifter, or member of another species from developing such powers.

								"Dor Maleer is a region of harsh plains, cold deserts, and mountains. It is a barren land, only slightly more hospitable than the Tashana Tundra that lies to the north. In the days before the Sundering, the northern mountains were the domain of the Akiak dwarves, while the plains were claimed by the Hual Maleer, a loose federation of human and shifter clans.",
								"The plains of Dor Maleer lack the resources to support large settlements, and the Hual Maleer have always lived in small communities, splitting and forming new clans when the population began to outstrip local resources. Dor Maleer contains multiple wild zones and manifest zones tied to {@b Lamannia}, but these showcase the versatility of that plane. Most people think of Lamannia as the Twilight Forest, as a plane that enhances the fertility of plants and animals... and this is a common element of Lamannian zones. But Lamannia embodies the power of nature, and that includes deadly storms, frigid tundras, raging volcanos, and more. The plains of Dor Maleer are broken up by regions of environmental extremes at odds with the surroundings. Wild zones could cause endless hurricanes, with free-roaming air elementals howling with the winds. There are vast pools of lava in the Maleeri plains, and fire elementals occasionally emerge to scorch the soil. There are also a few wild zones where the environment is more welcoming\u2014a stretch of dense forest, an impossibly verdant valley. Maleeri hunters forage and hunt in these regions, but attempting to settle them is unwise. These zones represent the indomitable force of the wild, and resist the intrusion of civilization. Disease, accelerated decay, and hostile wildlife will all plague any would-be settlers. And hostile wildlife in these zones is quite literally a big deal. These regions produce megafauna, massive beasts similar to rocs in size and power, though they can take many forms. These powerful beasts are sterile outside their zones, and thus haven't spread. But there are tales of ancient hunters feeding a village for a month with the corpse of a mighty bear dragged from the deep forest. These wild zones cannot be tamed, but there are a few manifest zones with less extreme effects, and these were the sites of Dor Maleer's largest communities.",
								"The mountains of Dor Maleer contain wild zones tied to {@b Risia} and {@b Dolurrh}. In the Risia zones, chasms are filled with ice and temperatures are far more severe than nature should allow. But the ice of Risia preserves, and time ceases to flow for creatures or objects encased in ice in such a zone. It's possible explorers could find ancient champions from the Sundering or the days of the old kingdoms\u2014or even a frozen dragon from the Age of Demons! The influence of Dolurrh is unpredictable. The most dramatic landmark is the Final Passage. When the moon Aryth is full, those who venture into this cavern can enter the Catacombs of Dolurrh. This offers a way to recover a soul that cannot be resurrected through normal means. But the Catacombs have guardians, and the Queen of the Dead doesn't surrender her subjects easily.",
								"The Frostblade (Paqaa) Mountains were the home of the Akiak dwarves, a dwarf culture that produces mountain, hill, and gray dwarves. The Akiak duergar are thought to be a mutation resulting from generations dwelling in the radius of the Dolurrh wild zones. In addition to their sensitivity to light, the Akiak duergar have an unusually strong bond to Dolurrh. This often results in a flat emotional affect; though they aren't paralyzed by the infamous ennui of Dolurrh, the Akiak are somber by nature. Akiak duergar hear the whispers of spirits, both the voices of their own ancestors and of others who have died in the places they pass through. Largely these voices form an incomprehensible chorus. However, some Akiak duergar hone their skills and become mediums (as per the {@creature magewright|ERLW} specialty in {@book Rising From The Last War|ERLW}). All duergar can learn to channel this babel, harnessing this choir of excess thought as pure psionic power; it's by channeling this power that a duergar can hide itself from the perceptions of others or temporarily expand its mass. Akiak champions learn to wield this power to produce devastating effects. In the days before the Sundering, the Akiak pioneered the development of psionic tools and channeling devices; the hanbalani monoliths that ensure Inspired dominance over Riedra are based on Akiak techniques.",

The first step for the Dreaming Dark was to build a force among the Hual Maleer\u2014causing tensions between clans and between human and shifter. Inspired champions arose within the clans, uniting them and spreading the word of the Path of Unity. The psychic Akiak proved resistant to the manipulations of the Dreaming Dark, but the quori amplified fear and conflict between them and the people of the lowlands. As the Unity of Riedra emerged, the first true Inspired offered peace to the Akiak, and paid them handsomely for their aid in creating the hanbalani and other elements of Riedran infrastructure.

The fortress of Kintarn Malin coordinates the defense of the northeastern border and also serves as a training center for the shifters of the Taskaan Legion. Beyond this, Maleeri villages are smaller and more loosely structured than their southern counterparts. There are relatively few hanbalani monoliths in the province and many villages don't have the shared dreams or receive messages from the Voice. As such, while most Maleeri still support the {@i idea} of the Unity, they are not as deeply indoctrinated as the people of other provinces. Rebels from other provinces who don't want to flee Riedra entirely might take shelter in Dor Maleer, where the Thousand Eyes aren't watching so closely.",

Local hunters work together to deal with rampaging megafauna, and elementals rarely stray far enough from their zones to endanger the inhabitants. The Final Passage doesn't unleash threats into the world, and mortals who enter it almost never return; so while there are a few Edgewalker outposts monitoring the region, these zones are largely accessible to adventurers.",

But search further and you may find patches of wall, foundations, or even small buildings formed from this dragonbone. It is virtually indestructible and seemingly immune to the passage of time. It's not made from the bones of the earth; it is a building substance used by the ancient couatl, the most numerous of the native celestials of Eberron. Khalesh is one of the places that the couatl came into the world in the Age of Demons, one of the anchors where these immortals would reform if they were destroyed.

Precedent suggests that the Khaleshites must have had their own equivalent of the Voice of the Flame, but few details of the ancient champions remain. The people of Khalesh were constantly clashing with their neighbors. They fought supernatural threats, battling aberrations from Khyber, destroying undead, smashing extraplanar threats. But they were unduly proud of their virtue, and the pervasive influence of Shavarath drove them to {@i fight}\u2014to look for flaws in the people around them. They fought the tyrants of Nulakhesh, clashed with the reavers of Rhiavhaar and the bandits of Sunyagir, and battled the beasts of Borunan. In periods when they were at peace with Nulakesh, they would join forces to attach Ohr Kaluun... which, to be fair, certainly deserved it.",

It's also a question as to whether any of the shulassakar were able to survive the Inspired purge. An unusual possibility is that in their last days, the Khaleshites developed their own form of deathless, similar to the councilors of the Undying Court.

Mabar wiped away empathy, driving people to be cruel and predatory. Kythri drove constant change, a quest for innovation and endless emerging factions. And Xoriat inspired the Kaluunites to pursue strange and terrible visions, to attempt things no mundane mind would consider.",

Thanks to the influence of Kythri, they made countless breakthroughs in arcane science but would rarely maintain or preserve these techniques; thus Kaluunite wizards wielded astonishing powers but rarely passed their knowledge on to future generations. The most widespread and consistent advancements in Ohr Kaluun were made by their warlocks and priests; the lords of Ohr Kaluun were more than willing to make dangerous bargains in exchange for the power that they craved.",

In theory these were hereditary bloodlines, but in practice the title was held by whoever could claim power and hold on to it, and feuds and uprisings were common. Ohr Kaluun is well known for its {@i war mazes}, vast labyrinths that served as both fortresses and cities. Each Shadow Lord dwelled at the heart of a great maze, pursuing their own paths to power and scheming against their rivals. Each lord generally followed a different path to power, and a maze would be devoted to a particular sinister patron, whether that was a member of the Dark Six, and overlord, or an archfiend from one of the planes. While there were a few Kaluunite lords known to have actually been loved by their people, the influences of Mabar and Xoriat drove the Kaluunites to horrific excess and cruelty. If you are ever looking for an image of a classically evil cult, for people willfully embracing the service of fiends or performing vile sacrifices, there are surely tales of Ohr Kaluun that serve that need.",

Every war maze was built within a particular zone, and that colored the practices and achievements of the inhabitants. Evidence suggests that both the skulks and the changelings were created in Ohr Kaluun, using magebreeding techniques that surely drew on the power of Kythri. The influence of Xoriat led them to pursue paths of magic no rational mind would conceive of. Thus, while Ohr Kaluun was known for its warlocks, the Kaluunites dealt with many different patrons; one maze might use the Fiend patron to reflect bargains with native fiends, another would use the Great Old One to reflect dealing with Xoriat, another might use Hexblade to reflect bargains with the Dark Powers of Mabar. The priests of Ohr Kaluun revered the Dark Six, but different mazes had their own unique pairings, names, and interpretations of the Six.",

We've never mentioned Ohr Kaluun as working with the daelkyr or symbionts\u2014but there certainly COULD have been a Shadow Lord who bargained with Belashyrra.

I've suggested that the Sun Queen inspired Tira Miron, but was she the daughter of Galifar the Dark, or was she still alive when Tira first took up her sword? The main point of these characters is that these are examples of what the rulers of Galifar could be: scholars, paladins, tieflings, traitors. Which each, I've tried to suggest ways that their stories could matter\u2014how adventurers might encounter their relics or tales in the present day.",

							"name": "Cyre ir'Wynarn",
							"entries": [
								"Casual students of history may be confused by contradictory accounts of the namesake of Cyre. In some accounts Cyre was Galifar's oldest daughter, a mere minute beyond her twin sister Aundair. In others, Cyre is described as the youngest son of Galifar I, who ruled as king after his father stepped down. Both accounts are true; it was Princess Cyre whose vision of unity shaped her father's kingdom, and King Cyre who ascended to his throne.",
								"The twins Aundair and Cyre were the most mystically gifted of the Wynarns. Aundair specialized in evocation and conjuration; she negotiated with celestials and fiends, and bought down her enemies with storm and fire. Cyre was devoted to divination, illusion, and transmutation. Her interest was always in understanding the true nature of a thing... and exploring the ways it could be expressed. Where Aundair was bold and often reckless, Cyre was thoughtful and empathetic. Cyre's motto is {@i \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create,\"} and it was her motto before it was the nation's. She sought to {@i understand} the people of the Five Nations, and it was her vision of all five working together\u2014of harnessing the best in all of them\u2014that drove the development of her nation and the foundation of Galifar.",
								"Cyre's mastery of transmutation was unprecedented in the Five Nations. Their greatest creation was {@i Cyre's Mantle}, which used principles of transmutation and divination both to alter the form of the wearer and imbue them with new knowledge. Cyre didn't use the {@i Mantle} as a disguise, but rather used it to create unique personas reflecting different  aspects of their identity. Their subjects grew used to \"The Five Faces of Cyre,\" and Cyre considered each to be as much their true face as the one they were born with; few who knew Cyre were surprised or disappointed that they chose to rule as a king, using a confident, decisive persona that embodied their strongest leadership qualities. After their coronation, Cyre used the {@i Mantle} less often; King Cyre wanted the people to have a clear and consistent image of their king, only using their other personas in private or with close advisors.",
								"Those who are familiar with changeling cultures may recognize elements of traveler philosophy in Cyre's use of personas. While the truth is buried beneath centuries, some tales say that Cyre had great respect for the Children of Jes and helped them establish havens across the united kingdom. In some of these tales, Cyre didn't actually create {@i Cyre's Mantle}, but rather received it as a gift from the Traveler. Whatever the truth, both {@i Cyre's Mantle} and a number of their advisors disappeared after the king's natural death; there have been a number of tales of the {@i Mantle} being used at various points in history, but its current location remains a mystery."

							"entries": [
								"Dyran ir'Wynarn was a Khoravar born of the union of the King of Galifar and the Duchess of the Duskwood. As a child, he spent a great deal of time on his mother's estates; some whispered that he was visiting his grandmother, an archfey whose domain lay on the other side of the Duskwood. Whatever the truth of this, there is no question that Dyran was remarkable. When he was appointed as governing Prince of Aundair, he was an Enchanter of the Third Circle; many believe that his true power was greater still but that he choose to conceal it. He was a brilliant orator, blending natural charisma and supernatural gifts. He strengthened the Arcane College considerably during his reign, but his life's work was tracking down and identifying Thelanian manifest zones, following up on obscure tales and walking forgotten paths. Aundairian bards know countless tales of Clever Dyran\u2014how he won the crown of the Count of the Barren Marches, danced with Lady Perilous in the Palace of the Moon, and stole arcane secrets from the Mother of Invention. Some say that he surely could have stolen the throne of Galifar from his human brother Dolan, but that Clever Dyran had no desire to rule. Prince Dyran disappeared when he was 111 years old; the tales say that he surely went to claim a seat in the Palace of the Moon, and that he might be there still today.",
								"While the details aren't known to history, Prince Dyran negotiated with many of the archfey of Thelanis, both on his own behalf and for the good of his nation. Dyran's journals could provide insight both into the location of Thelanian manifest zones and secrets of the archfey; perhaps he made bargains that could still be invoked today. His vaults surely included treasures of Thelanis, and an unusual trinket could turn out to be a fey heirloom of Clever Dyran."

							"entries": [
								"Young Galifar was born in Vult, on the darkest night of Long Shadows. The common story says that both his mother and the attending Jorasco chirurgeon were found dead in the birthing room, the silent child still cradled in his mother's arms. The servants whispered that the child was cursed, that plants withered in his shadow. But it seemed Galifar could sense those who carried death in their heart; when a would-be assassin sought to kill King Cyre, the boy called out the killer's name and the assassin fell dead at Cyre's feet. While others still feared the prince, Cyre embraced him and the two were inseparable until the King's death.",
								"This is a popular story, but as with so many elements of history, the concrete facts are shrouded in mystery. Many scholars believe that Galifar II was a tiefling with ties to Mabar; but others say that the king had an aberrant dragonmark in a place easily concealed. It's said that when Galifar looked at someone, he knew exactly when and how they would die. But while it was these eerie gifts and his cold demeanor that earned Galifar his sobriquet, Galifar II was a good ruler who strengthened the bonds between the Five Nations, reinforcing the Galifar Code of Justice and overhauling the calendar; it was Galifar the Dark who established the {@i Year of the Kingdom} still used today.",
								"Aberrant dragonmarks were rarer in Galifar II's time than in the present day, and if Galifar's \"gift\" was a dragonmark, it was a strong one. If Galifar the Dark did have an aberrant dragonmark, he may have done research into these marks during his reign; it's possible that he sheltered other aberrants, or developed focus items for his or other aberrant marks. If aberrant-marked adventurers in the present day could find conclusive evidence of Galifar's mark\u2014or a cache of journals or tools\u2014it could have interesting repercussions for House Tarkanan and the Twelve."

							"entries": [
								"Hala ir'Wynarn never expected to be Queen of Galifar. The fourth child of the king, she was appointed Princess of Thrane. She devoted herself to Dol Arrah, studying the arts of war and vowing to live a virtuous life. When cruel fate slew her older siblings and placed her on the throne, she began her reign by purging corrupt elements within the royal court and the Army of Galifar. She quickly turned her attention to the ongoing conflicts in southern Cyre and western Breland, and insisted on leading campaigns against ogres and worgs. She was celebrated by the common folk of Breland and advanced the borders of the nation. Stories say that it was her younger brother who convinced her to pursue a grander threat than any mere ogre or troll. At that time, Sora Maenya had been credited with the destruction of a number of small villages on the edge of Aundair, and the Sun Queen led an elite force of trackers and hunters into the Towering Wood to finally end this threat. Hala was only 24 when she led her troops into the Wood, and had yet to produce an heir; her brother claimed the throne when she was finally declared to be dead.",
								"Hala ir'Wynarn is a legendary champion and an inspiration for paladins; Tira Miron was likely following the example of the Sun Queen. Only Sora Maenya knows her final fate, and it's possible that the hag still has Hala's arms and armor\u2014or that they are hidden somewhere in the Towering Wood. A gruesome possibility is that Maenya has bound Hala's soul and has the queen's skull among her trophies; adventurers could be charged to recover the relic and finally allow Hala to rest."

Much of the common traditions of education in Galifar are the direct result of Marala's efforts, leading the people to call her the Hand of Aureon.",
								"In addition to her public works, Queen Marala took great pride in her personal library. She collected tomes from across Eberron, and was known to possess rare texts and spellshards from Aerenal, Ohr Kaluun, and even a massive codex written by a Cul'sir wizard of ancient Xen'drik. The tales say that her library was hidden in an invisible tower; modern scholars believe that this was probably some form of {@spell Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion|PHB|magnificent mansion}. She died under mysterious circumstances, and her trove of texts wasn't accounted for in her will; it's quite possible that her invisible tower is still out there in the ether, waiting to be found."

							"entries": [
								"Prince of Breland, Sarath was last in line to ascend the throne... and yet, one by one, his siblings fell prey to misfortune. In {@i The Serpent and The Crown} the playwight Miala Shol claims that Sarath orchestrated all of these deaths, that he even worked with a shapeshifting fiend to clear his path to the throne. Sarath's culpability in these early deaths is conjecture, but when his fourth and final sibling Laeran took the throne, Sarath stepped into the light. Laeran was a Khoravar, and it was Sarath who first asserted that no half-elf could claim the mantle of Galifar. Laeran was well-loved in Thrane and Aundair, but Sarath succeeded in poisoning the minds of many. While Laeran's Khoravar blood was an early pretext, Sarath found other faultlines that had formed over the centuries, amplifying these and using the anger and frustration of the people to strengthen his position. These schemes ultimately brought down Laeran and set Sarath upon the throne, but in the end he reaped what he had sowed. The fires of hatred that he'd lit continued to burn; there were uprisings across Breland, and his reign was finally brought to an end by a swift civil war led by the Archdukes of Thrane and Aundair.",
								"Sarath is just one example of the Wynarns who placed personal power and ambition above the public good. His short reign is surely invoked by the Swords of Liberty and others who say that the monarchy does more harm than good, and the poisonous lies he spread are still told by those who hate the Khoravar. A critical question is whether he was working with the Lords of Dust, as Miala Shol suggested in her play; Bel Shalor revels in the suffering of innocents, and Eldrantulku would delight in a brother murdering his siblings and sowing strife across his kingdom. It's quite possible that Sarath claiming the throne was a crucial point in the Draconic Prophecy, that securing the power of the Serpent King was a victory for one of the overlords; but did Sarath's fall undo that triumph, or was this just one piece of a plot that will finally come to fruition in the present day?"
