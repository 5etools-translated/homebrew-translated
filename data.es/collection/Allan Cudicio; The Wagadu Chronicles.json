						"Recuerdo la primera vez que vi un libro de juegos de rol de mesa, hace más de veinte años. Era una cosa exótica y extraña, y después de hojear unas cuantas páginas... me di cuenta de que por fin podría revivir las aventuras del Señor de los Anillos y de Final Fantasy VII con mis amigos, alrededor de una mesa, sin limitaciones de ningún tipo, sólo nosotros y la imaginación pura. Estaba enganchado, y lo estoy desde entonces.",
						"Los juegos de rol de mesa me han influido hasta el punto de que mi carrera como diseñador de videojuegos se basa en ese momento: aquel joven negro no lo sabía, pero la magia había entrado en su vida para no volver a salir.",
						"Pero ese no era el final de la historia, algo faltaba. Durante muchos años, todos los personajes que creaba y casi todos los PNJ y culturas de mis historias no se parecían a mí. Durante mucho tiempo no lo cuestioné, simplemente lo acepté como un hecho: la gente que se parecía a mí simplemente no pertenecía a la Fantasía.",
						"A medida que fui creciendo, vi cómo esto sucedía en básicamente todas las facetas de nuestra sociedad, ciertas voces son sistemáticamente dejadas de lado, o peor.",
						"Así que, con el tiempo, tuve un segundo despertar. He tenido la suerte de ser hijo de una mujer africana soltera que, a pesar de todas las adversidades, siempre se aseguró de que sus hijos supieran con orgullo de dónde venían. Ya es hora de que tome esta bendición y la lleve a los juegos.",
						"Wagadu no procede de un lugar de ira, sino de uno de amor. Cuando amas algo quieres más de ello, y quieres mejorarlo. Este libro es sólo un primer paso, un pequeño primer paso que ojalá mi torpe yo de 14 años hubiera podido presenciar; ojalá, mientras planeaba la siguiente aventura con sus amigos, esos maravillosos libros le hubieran susurrado \"¡Negro y marica es hermoso, sé el héroe que realmente quieres ser!\". Pues ahora lo estoy gritando a pleno pulmón, que lo disfruten.",

Esto puede ocurrir a través de todo tipo de medios; a través de películas como Black Panther, a través de la música como Black is King e incluso a través de los juegos, como este libro y su próximo videojuego.",
										"Queremos que las culturas y fantasías negras se impongan en la sociedad mayoritaria. Japón se ha beneficiado de la amplia adopción de sus \"tropos\" culturales, como los samuráis o los ninjas. Los creadores japoneses están mejor, tienen un público más amplio y un mayor respeto y reconocimiento de su cultura.",

Los amos coloniales y los traficantes de esclavos querían que nuestras culturas y nuestra historia desaparecieran, y no les gustaría que las celebraras con nosotros, así que hazlo.",

								"Wagadu puede describirse como una especie de purgatorio, un lugar extraño y salvaje en el que la gente de los Reinos Superiores, el lugar próspero y más pacífico del que proceden todos, \"cae\" y queda atrapada para siempre.",
								"Nadie sabe exactamente por qué la gente cae en Wagadu, pero lo que está claro es que es un proceso irreversible y que lo único que pueden hacer los Caídos es agruparse para sobrevivir al hermoso y duro mundo de Wagadu.",
								"Espíritus poderosos, ancestros inconstantes, bestias furiosas y climas mágicos son sólo algunos de los retos a los que se enfrentan los Caídos, pero por otro lado, suelos fértiles, magia poderosa y poderosas tradiciones que revivir están ahí para recompensar a los supervivientes más resistentes.",

Esto se debe a que los Caídos traen constantemente ideas y culturas con ellos cuando son arrojados a Wagadu.",
										"Sin embargo, se puede esperar que las versiones de Wagadu sean más \"salvajes\", fragmentadas y aventureras. Por ejemplo, mientras que un Imperio Asiman puede durar 2.000 años en los Mundos Superiores, su reencarnación en Wagadu abarcaría unos cuantos ciclos, cayendo en ruinas entre medias y tal vez siendo invadido por los señores de los Espíritus durante un par de siglos; además, podría ser mucho más diverso que su homólogo \"original\", con gente de todos los linajes acudiendo a su seguridad."

										"Wagadu está habitado por todo tipo de personas, miembros de todos los linajes y de todas las clases sociales, pero todos los wagadianos que conocerás en tus aventuras no nacieron allí: todos ellos \"cayeron\" del Mundo Superior.",
										"Para los que lo recuerdan, la caída fue como perder los sentidos mientras realizaban sus actividades en el Mundo Superior, para otros fue como entrar en un sueño vívido mientras dormían.",
										"Para la gente de Wagadu, los nuevos Caídos aparecen como estrellas brillantes, atravesando el cielo antes de caer en picado. Los Caídos suelen estar protegidos por una cáscara de huevo que se agrieta tras el impacto, permitiendo a la persona desnuda, viscosa y confundida, abrirse camino hacia el exterior. Por desgracia, no todos los Caídos sobreviven al impacto, o bien mueren en el huevo o salen arrastrándose para ser recibidos por uno de los peligros de Wagadu antes de que cualquier ayuda pueda llegar a tiempo.",
										"Una cosa que todas las personas de Wagadu comparten es la pérdida de memoria que sigue a la caída. Para algunas personas son sólo grandes lagunas en su vida y para otras es tan grave como no saber siquiera su nombre. Además, no se puede confiar al 100% en los recuerdos del Mundo Superior: podrían ser \"recuerdos de huevo\"; se sabe que la Caída desordena la mente de las personas y hay más de una historia de viejos amigos del Mundo Superior que se encuentran en Wagadu sólo para descubrir que tienen versiones muy diferentes de sus experiencias compartidas.",
										"Es una tradición antigua e ininterrumpida que los pueblos de todas las culturas ofrezcan ayuda a los recién caídos y, cuando las estrellas fugaces iluminan el cielo, se suele enviar a alguien a buscar y ayudar a los recién llegados.",
										"Si estas partidas no encuentran a los Caídos y los ayudan con comida y equipo, muy a menudo los ancestros y más raramente los espíritus, ofrecen ayuda. Se suelen dar túnicas amarillas sencillas a los nuevos caídos.",
										"Los patrones de caída son misteriosos, pero no parecen ser totalmente aleatorios. A veces, un número desproporcionado de Asiman puede caer en las cercanías de una antigua ciudad oasis, por ejemplo, otras veces los patrones son indiscernibles y se sabe que algunos incluso han caído en medio del océano (sin ser Ikakis o Ndyams que respiran agua).",
										"Los niños nacidos en Wagadu crecen invariablemente para unirse al mundo de los espíritus, lo que significa que la única forma de reponer las ciudades y los pueblos es a través de nuevos Caídos; cuando la gente deja de caer se produce un lento declive que conduce inexorablemente a la extinción de toda persona viva en Wagadu.",
										"Después de una extinción, cada vez que alguien cae, comienza un nuevo ciclo. Un ciclo puede durar una generación o, en algunos casos raros, incluso siglos, siempre que la gente siga cayendo y reponiendo Wagadu. La gente suele caer en \"lluvias\", es decir, en oleadas irregulares de personas en diferentes momentos y lugares.",
										"La única razón por la que algunas ciudades y civilizaciones en Wagadu a veces atraviesan Ciclos es porque o bien reflejan algún estado de cosas en curso en el Mundo Superior o porque los ancestros en Wagadu otorgan a los nuevos Caídos conocimientos para continuar con legados y tradiciones específicas."

Durante la estación seca, muchos cursos de agua se reducen o se secan, la hierba se marchita y algunos árboles pierden sus hojas, mientras que en la estación de las lluvias, los lagos y ríos se hinchan y la naturaleza se vuelve exuberante y verde.",

Si es así, recomiendo utilizarlos con moderación: puede ser catártico liberar a un pueblo aislado de esclavos, pero puede resultar deprimente jugar una campaña en la que la mayor parte de Wagadu esté encadenada. La esclavitud de los Espíritus de Wagadu es actualmente rara, y fue practicada sobre todo por los Espíritus en la 6ª era (y, según algunas leyendas, también en las dos primeras eras), la esclavitud de los Espíritus de Wagadu está más cerca de la esclavitud/servidumbre africana precolonial que de la esclavitud americana: la mayoría de los esclavos de Wagadu tienen algunos derechos y algunos pueden incluso llegar a ser líderes de la comunidad respetables y ricos (aunque siempre bajo la propiedad de algún Espíritu). Los espíritus que esclavizan a la gente justifican esto como una \"forma ordenada\" de gestionar la \"intrusión\" de los Caídos en Wagadu y \"ofrecer protección\" a los esclavizados contra alguna amenaza (a menudo fabricada).",
										"Si decides con el grupo dirigir un juego en la 4ª era, entonces podrías encontrarte con muchos ciclos que tienen puntos de vista \"conservadores\" sobre los roles de género y la sexualidad: los tambores sólo pueden ser golpeados por hombres, sólo las mujeres llevan cosas en la cabeza, el sexo no creativo podría estar mal visto. Este tipo de estrechez de miras podría no ser sólo patriarcal, sino también matriarcal o incluso queer, como en una sociedad en la que las parejas heterosexuales están totalmente prohibidas y la mayoría no puede expresar sus afectos libremente.",
										"En la mayoría de los ciclos de las épocas siguientes, estas reglas se olvidan en gran medida y las comunidades que las mantienen suelen hacerlo por la influencia de algunos antepasados muy antiguos pero activos de la 4ª época (que podrían convertirse en un villano interesante para los jugadores). Wagadu es un lugar abierto y diverso y, con previsión, estas excepciones pueden realzarlo y destacarlo, en lugar de socavarlo."

Esto es lo que es un linaje, una manifestación física de una influencia ancestral y espiritual sobre ti.",
								"Para la mayoría de los individuos, los linajes suelen ser \"heredados\" de uno de los padres, pero no siempre es así, algunos niños manifiestan espontáneamente un linaje de los abuelos o de aparentemente \"ninguna parte\" (los eruditos de Wagadu sostienen que, si se profundiza, todo el mundo está relacionado en última instancia con todo el mundo, por lo que cada Fallen tiene ascendencia en todos los linajes). La mayoría de los bebés nacen con un linaje visible, pero unos pocos nacen \"latentes\" sin rasgos perceptibles hasta que crecen (estos tardíos suelen manifestar un linaje cuando son adolescentes). Algunas personas también cambian de linaje a lo largo de su vida, al darse cuenta de que se identifican más con un linaje diferente al de su familia. La mayoría de las veces, este cambio está influenciado por otros miembros de ese linaje, pero a veces puede ocurrir incluso sin ningún contacto con su nuevo linaje. En esos raros casos, es la sintonía con un aspecto específico de su existencia lo que ayuda a transformarlos (por ejemplo, un Ironblood marinero aislado que acaba convirtiéndose en Ikaki).",
								"Pertenecer a un linaje no afecta simplemente a tu aspecto; las nuevas formas en que los Ancestros y los espíritus se comportan contigo y los cambios en tu cuerpo tienen tal impacto que dos miembros del mismo linaje, aunque sean de culturas muy diferentes, siempre tendrán algo en común. La Emere solitaria que ha nacido en un pueblo completamente Swala seguirá teniendo la misma comprensión básica de la magia (\"Conocimiento Juju\") que tiene una Emere con formación mágica de la lejana ciudad de la selva tropical, gracias a los sueños místicos y a las visitas de los Ancestros Emere, aunque siga identificándose como parte cultural de las Nubes de Lluvia, la cultura Swala dominante de esas praderas, y le guste sacar a pastar su ganado entre sus estudios mágicos."

								"The Daa'imas special role was not just that one of messengers but also of guardians of the primordial Birapinya tree, a giant sycamore-fig that reached the heavens.",
								"This tree was marvellous and its magic was so strong that everyone could use it to reach the heavens. Wagadu, the Upper Realms and the Heavens were all connected through the massive branches of the Birapinya. Its fruits were the bright pure magic.",
								"The queen and goddess of the Daa'ima was Addeessa, the Moon. She cherished their freedom and helped from afar but had one rule about the Birapinya: it could be climbed and flown through only when she was looking (the moon visible in the sky), and it would not when she looked away (new moon).",
								"Additionally she asked them to keep her brother Du'a away from the tree.",
								"When there was a new moon, Addeessa always gave way to her twin brother Du'a, God of Waters and Death. As Du'a, the Moon always whispered to the Daa'imas, promising them to reveal the \"secrets of death\" if they allowed him on the Birapinya when Mother Moon was not looking.",
								"After refusing several times, one dark new-moon night, they finally agreed \"but only briefly\" they said. The God of Waters rained on the Birapinya, he rained and rained until its roots rot and its magic began to fade.",
								"Fear struck their hearts as the Tree withered and at the same time, as the Birapinya's life faded, a new consciousness of death awoke in the Daa'imas hearts, an awareness that was never to disappear.",
								"When the tree died, it's heavy dead branches fell through worlds, causing earthquakes and catastrophes and the path between worlds was no more.",
								"When Mother Moon returned, she saw what her children had done and with tears that were falling stars, she watched them for a full lunar month. Not only the Tree was dead but their wings, wet by the cursed rain were shrunken and broken. The Daa'imas were struggling to survive on the ground, lost and starved.",
								"Just as she was considering abandoning them for good, bats, owls, moths and other nocturnal flying messengers (the Ayaana) begged her to have mercy and told her about the Water God's trickery.",
								"Addeessa forgave them but said that she would not give back their old wings, they will stay shrunken as a warning to their descendants.",
								"The Ayaana got together, massive flocks and swarms of birds, bats and insects, to help the Daa'ima. They taught them how to build huts, find food and apply bird & beed husbandry.",
								"To feed their souls, they taught them Saffu (view \"Philosophy and Religion below).",
								"The Daa'ima began to thrive again, settling in mountains to be closer to Mother Moon but nurturing the death knowledge they gained from the Birapinya's rot.",
								"Many moons later, the legendary sorcerer Hamilan discovered lithium and thanks to Mother Moon he was able to turn it into Sibiila. This hard glowing metal allowed Daa'imas to trade and get more intertwined with the other people. It is said that thanks to Sibiila, many Winged Folk started moving to cities to trade and ended up starting communities there giving rise to the Full Moon branch of the Daa'imas."

						"One day, a flock of birds covered the compound's roof and started attacking any member of her family who would try to leave. Adusa, who was in the forest, saw them and knew something was amiss. Rather than trying to go home she went back into the forest and called aloud.",

As Adusa bent several spirits to her will, people kept on coming. Eventually the place became a prosperous kingdom which eventually would get called Adusa's Earrings.",

If it disagrees they might have to subdue it with a fight, but assuming it accepts the offerings, the Spirit becomes Green Water, servant of Sika Maame.
