If you feel especially sadistic, you can even have Persona impersonate a party member, using a hat of disguise to look identical, and one of his masks to imitate that character's unique skills.",
					"{@b Origin}",
					"No one knows for certain who Persona was before he donned his first mask. Many speculate that he was a famous, now forgotten, stage performer, or a well-known, but ill-respected nobleman, but nothing more than incidental evidence truly points to these origins. Persona is an enigma; perhaps there is nothing behind his mask at all. ",
					"For years, a masked thief, conman, and impersonator has been a blight on the most powerful people of Pyremarch. No one has ever seen his face directly for Persona conceals his identity with a number of masks, painted to represent and mock archetypes of the stage. These masks bestow unique powers, related to the characters they represent, which makes Persona immensely as versatile in a fight as he is deadly. Beyond that, when he makes himself known, he wears the fineries of a nobleman, with no less than a dozen rings upon his fingers. ",
					"But most often, he is in disguise. Persona is perhaps the greatest performer that has ever lived; he can inhabit a role so completely as to fool the friends and families of the people he impersonates, which has allowed him to pull off truly incredible robberies and assassinations. He has amassed a small fortune, and made a deadly enemy of the Thieves' Guild, who he confounds at every turn. ",
					"It would appear that all of Persona's actions has been leading to something. The assassination of noblemen, the theft of powerful magic items, and the careful spread of misinformation has thrown the factions of the city into chaos. If he is not stopped, this single masked man might bring thousands to ruin.",
					"{@b Battling Persona}",
					"Persona is far more likely to flee combat than fight an entire party, but he is apt to put himself at risk in order to make a dramatic entrance or exit. Importantly, Persona often tries to charm his audience to sympathizing with his side, even though he rarely tells the truth. ",
					"You might encounter Persona flanked by a pair of official palace guards or a crowd of entranced townsfolk. Wherever he goes, he makes temporary allies to aide him in his goals."

					"Ki Vampires are known across the east, and are feared far more than any other type of undead, for while other undead lose their identities entirely, the Jiangshi persist as they were, with a deadly intelligence, and a lifetime of martial arts skill. Few know that the dreaded Jiangshi are, in fact, mortal, and fewer still know the story of Siddhartha, the immortal first of their kind.",
					"Siddhartha traveled to the east from a far off land, over the mountains to trade spices and silks for gold. When his stocks were sold, and his coffers full, he intended to return home, but was ambushed on the road by ruthless bandits. Siddhartha was a generous man, and offered the men half his gold, a small fortune, if he could carry on safely to his homeland, but the bandits refused. Throwing him from his cart, the bandits took all he had, then broke both his legs and left him to die.",
					"A day passed, and Siddhartha saw no one else upon the road, but watched a small, persistent light flicked high up in the mountains nearby. With heroic strength, the next morning he bound his legs with bamboo, and crawled up the mountain to find help. At the top, he found a monastery, full of kind monks, who fed him, nursed him back to health, and taught him the Way of the Open Palm, and of the ki that suffuses all of us.",
					"Siddhartha stayed with the monks for a year and a day, learning all they had to teach him, but held inside him a seething hate for those who had assaulted him on the road. When he at last could walk, albeit with stiff legs, he left the monastery and found the bandit's hideout. In a rage, he killed everyone he found there, embracing the darkness within himself, and shunning balance with his ki.",
					"In the decades to come, Siddhartha would refine the Way of the Jiangshi and take several pupils. His skin turned grey and withered, and before long, he was indistinguishable from a corpse. Indeed, Siddhartha has lived hundreds of years, and claimed hundreds of lives.",
					"He seeks larger, more powerful spirits to drain and increase his own strength, and uses his army of Jiangshi to seek them out. Siddhartha covets the divine right of emperors and kings, especially, and seeks, whenever possible, to drain their ki to fuel his own.",
					"{@b Battling Siddhartha}",
					"Siddhartha is always to be found among no less than two Jiangshi warriors (use Vampire Spawn stats, but without the Vampire Weaknesses traits.) He will likely know of the party and the party's weaknesses before the fight, and will use this knowledge to his advantage."

No one has ever glanced inside this box and kept their faith.",

Though the temples of the Pantheon are strong and deeply-rooted, contingents of alchemists and arcanists have joined the cause as well -- science and reason are enough evidence for many.",

For an instant, he saw the edge of a Great Table, and immense legs of chairs, and understood that the beings above it all were not gods at all. The Icosahedron, a surprisingly dense 20-sided object, about a foot across, is engraved with strange symbols on each face. When it placed on the ground with one side facing up, those around it can feel the shifting of reality and the pull of fate. Some symbols are more powerful than others, for weal and for woe.",
					"Lastly, when the Icosahedron is rolled, it imparts a sense of scale: The Icosahedron is from reality, and nothing else truly is.",
					"Ransom has two goals for the icosahedron, which stem from his belief in justice and law: he wishes to return it to The Table from whence it came, and he wishes to use it to destroy the universe. The universe is false, a creation of the un-divine, and should be ended. Simultaneously, the Icosahedron belongs to the creators, and should be returned, that all things should be equal when it is over. Nothing else truly matters to him."

Failing that, Virgil looks for something powerful enough to destroy his soul, regardless of the collateral damage. Destroying the world would be acceptable to him, if he can avoid a return to the underworld in the process.",

Lady Patia was a beautiful commoner turned wife of a nobleman, quite against her will. Her husband was Barnum Fax, a despotic nobleman who governed many estates in the East on behalf of the king and was infamous for his mistreatment for his property, including his servants, employees, and wives. However it was that Patia died, it was certainly by his hand, and was so savage that no one that witnessed it dare repeat its details. One year later, Patia's grave was found empty, dug up from the inside.",

She quickly raised an army of corpses and overran Fax's estates, forcing him to flee westward. The cowardly Fax is still on the run, pursued by an undead horde which sweeps the countryside, adding to their numbers wherever they travel. Over a year has passed, and yet Patia the Pale, as she has come to be known, clings to undeath, indicating that she is a revenant of the rarest variety, one gifted with a decade to seek vengeance against those who wronged her. Yet Fax remains hidden, and Patia's pale horde grows.",

					"Directly confronting Patia is no mean feat. She is perpetually followed by her undead horde, a mass of thousands of zombies, skeletons, and ghouls, with a handful of ghasts, wights, and ghosts mixed in. She only reveals herself directly when she thinks she has an opportunity to kill Barnum Fax. Even excluding that, she is a powerful sorcerer in her own right, with a talent for necromancy spells.",
					"There is an alternate approach to dispatch Patia, without fighting through an army of undead. If the party can locate and kill Fax, Patia will return to the afterlife, and her undead will simple become inanimate. Of course, if finding him were easy, no doubt Patia would have managed it already\u2013Fax seems to be protected by powerful magic."

It grapples a prospective host in its tendrils, then burrows into its body, taking up residence in the space between the host's body cavities. Once inside, it generally does one of three things: it can choose to negotiate with its host, offering magic and power, it can coerce its host by wreaking immense pain on its body, or it can simply kill the host and use its corpse as a puppet for a short while, until it begins to rot. One can track the parasite's travels by following a string of desiccated corpses and grisly murders.",

In exchange, the host merely has to follow the parasite's telepathic commands, and allow the parasite to live within it. This pact is a deeply attractive offer, but comes with the eventual cost of the hosts own life, for the more magic the host uses, the greater toll the parasite takes on its system.",

His wife developed a cough, and began to lose the feeling in her fingers. She eventually bore him a daughter, but perished in childbirth, and the child was born very ill. Clerics, healers, and other wizards visited in turn, but none could do anything to alleviate the sickness.",

But rather than summon one to the Material Plane to negotiate with, Faust chose a more daring option: with a dark ritual, he traveled alone to the Nine Hells and sought out a devil named the Advocate. Because he met the Advocate on his terms, he thought he could negotiate a better deal from the fiend, and perhaps could save his child from death. The Advocate suspended time in his domain, and negotiated with Faust for years. The two eventually came to an agreement that Faust believed to be free of any loopholes or disadvantages. He was wrong.",

First, Faust must have the king assassinated by a profane dagger, and ensure that his brother, a wicked servant of the Advocate, would ascend to the throne. Second, he must cause a great disaster within the nation, one that shall cost thousands of innocent lives in the Advocate's name. Lastly, he must open a gate to the Advocate's domain in the Nine Hells, allowing innumerable devils to stream forth into the mortal realm. Only then will Faust be able to remedy his child.",

					"But these protectors are nothing compared to the infernal allies that Faust can call upon. His work is deemed very important by the Advocate, and so a host of devils are automatically summoned to his location whenever Faust would prove to be in mortal danger. Of course, he makes good to never allow his infernal friends to expose him, so he rarely summons them in public places, unless the situation is truly dire or he is confident that he can deal with all the witnesses."
