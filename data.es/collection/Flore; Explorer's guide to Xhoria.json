Noted craftsmen, the Waelen enjoy income from their artisans, as well as profiting from their expertise with gold-working. Their culture, craft and wealth are illustrated in the form of fantastic gold torques and other jewelry worn by their nobles.

Blending animism with a pantheon of local and lesser household gods, the Waelen religion is one of the key factors uniting the disparate isles. The importance and political sway of an island, beside its military power and wealth, is measured how much it is \"touched by the goddess\", with the presence of moonwells.

It is common for skavarot to show their superiority towards their underlings by showering them with shrill abuse on a regular basis. These actions are as much as to inflate a skavarot's ego as to deter potential rivals. Thus, while the failures of a skavarot are due to the weaknesses or the machinations of others, their achievements are nevertheless the result of his own incredible talents. To a skavarot, if a group assault decimates the enemy, it would be thanks to his brilliant planning. If a skavarot horde emerges in the right place, it is thanks to his genius that they have discovered the right path.

The Jesters could even request a hit on an NPC, no questions asked or answered. The DM is to provide a debt call proportionate to the favor fulfilled. If a favor is not repaid within a reasonable period of time, membership to the Jesters can be revoked, and if the debt is large enough, the player may become the next hit contract to make the rounds."
