				"A simple blacksmith raises his hammer above the glowing-hot steel. It strikes once. Twice. He lifts it a third, and holds it in his grasp as he studies the steel. As if in anticipation, the hammer begins to quake with holy force and he brings it down again and again, his divine strength aiding his work.",
				"A half-elf clad in common clothes watches her friend prepare alchemical mixtures, combining the contents of distilled vials into one another before letting loose a shriek as the concoction erupts before her. Looking on the failed works of her friend, the half-elf pats her back with a smile. \"It is alright,\" she speaks, \"try once more, sister. Your work is of the utmost importance.\"",

				"The Oath of the Common Man is born of togetherness, mutual suffering, and righteous indignation at those who would put their boot heel to the collective neck of the worst-off in society. When a greedy baron levies unfair taxes that cut the poor to the bone, when a pompous dragon ransacks the countryside to build his own personal hoard, when a bloodthirsty tyrant forces the poor into conscripted service in his armies, to fight and die on the frontlines, the paladin of the Common Man will be there with the fury of the oppressed at their back, with thunder in their voice and fire in their eyes, and the will of the people behind their every word and action. To a paladin of the Common Man, tyrants and avaricious industrialists are worse than any fiend, and they must be thrown down, their schemes bent and broken, before the might of those they sought to keep beneath them.",
