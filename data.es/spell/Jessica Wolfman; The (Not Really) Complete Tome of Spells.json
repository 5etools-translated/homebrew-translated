				"A major changes is one that adds, removes, or completely alters memories, beliefs, or opinions it has about an individual, organization, or concept, especially if it has a great deal of intellectual or emotional significance to the target. You may also change a creature's alignment in this manner.",
				"For instance, you can alter a paladin's memories so that where she once remembered the high priest of her homeland as being a fair and just man, she now remembers him slaughtering peasants for fun and as sacrifices to dark gods. You can cause cool-headed assassin to become sickened by the thought of harming another and turn herself and her entire guild over to the law for just punishment. Or you can make a dull and retiring peasant believe that he is the Chosen One and cause him to immediately begin rallying people to join his cause to try to issue in a new world order. Any of these things would act as an example of a single major change.",

For instance, you can cause a target to become a teetotaler (or to begin drinking more heavily), to stop spitting and belching in public, or to forget about that one time the baker overcharged him. A minor change such as this is automatic and cannot be resisted.",
