The images may be accompanied by sound as well; for example, the memory of seeing and hearing a conversation, up to the maximum safe volume for the listeners.",
				"Alternatively, this spell could be used on an unwilling creature at 30 or less hit points, in which case the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell functions as normal except the affected creature has no control over what images can be shown, has no ability to end the spell, and you can forcibly pull images from the target's memories. In this case, the target can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of every minute to end the spell. "
