				"Archeillus once stood below only {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} himself in the pantheon of the ancient Kingdoms of Foere. Though the first overking, Macobert, claimed familial descent from the sea god Quell, it was by virtue of the laws and customs of Archeillus that he claimed rightful rule over all the kingdoms and their client states. Despite these once heady heights of influence across the whole of Akados, with the decline of Foere, so too has the worship of Archeillus seen its decline. This has arguably been furthered by the slow increase of support for the foreign deity {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} as the divine patron of the Foerdewaith sovereignty, a trend whose beginnings can be traced back to the time of the great, great, grandson of Macobert, Osbert II, some seven centuries ago.",
				"Still an important god of the Foerdewaith, his religion is now often seen as old-fashioned or outdated, though he remains revered among many of the old noble families, especially in the more backwater areas. This devotion often even includes noble families that are not of Foerdewaith descent or rulers of lands outside Foere's sphere of influence. This is in large part because veneration of Archeillus is traditionally seen as a support of the current ruling class and serves to justify maintenance of the status quo of power among adherents. As a result of this common understanding, despite the fact that Archeillus is inherently a god of law and good, his religion is used by many a less-benign tyrant as means to consolidate and hold power with a veneer of legitimacy. The established church of Archeillus officially finds this practice repellant but also finds it prudent to not try and identify those who should or should not rule because of the inherent risk of opposing a true believer who has merely been mischaracterized by his subjects or, even worse, finding themselves forced to choose sides and ending up on the losing end of a political power struggle.",
				"With its loss in influence over the last few centuries and the inevitable reduction in the number of followers, the clergy of Archeillus has learned to step carefully and walk a fine line between clearly upholding the morality and rule of just law represented by Archeillus and stepping cautiously to avoid upsetting the apple cart of local politics that could result in them being completely removed from the halls of power and spheres of influence altogether. Many priests of Archeillus take comfort in the oft-quoted axiom, \"he that rules does so but by the will of Archeillus,\" allowing responsibility for the issue of rightful rulership to fall squarely upon the shoulders of the god himself. They trust that Archeillus's wisdom will sort out the details rather than muddying the waters by the machinations and inevitable disasters wrought by imperfect mortals, which is perhaps what the god has intended all along."

				"Belon appears to his worshippers as an elderly man wearing flowing white robes and carrying a walking staff. Belon is the embodiment of things learned upon the road, be they magical or mundane knowledge.Priests of Belon often serve as guides, educating themselves in local customs in order to afford better traveling conditions for those in their care. As such, Belon is patron of both journeys and knowledge, exemplified in the wisdom that can be gained by being well traveled. An emphasis on common sense ensures that he finds adherents among the stolid common folk of the world rather than only the scholars and learned.",
				"Belon the Wise was not originally a god of the Hyperborean or Foerdewaith pantheons. He seems to have been an Eastern god of some as yet unidentified Libynosi pantheon. Some scholars speculate that he was a lesser god of the Gohtra of Far Jaati. Other evidence seems to suggest that he was perhaps once an apprentice to Thasizier, the Libynosi Master of Good Magic and ancient enemy of the witch-goddess Hecate. Whatever his origin, it seems likely that Belon became introduced to the folk of Akados after having been carried back home by Foerdewaith crusaders sojourning in eastern realms.",
				"Belon's earliest influence in Akados seems to have been in and around the city of Bard's Gate where he enjoyed some popularity as a god of travel among a burgeoning city of merchants and travelers. Over time, however, his worship waned in favor of other gods that hold mercantilism and commerce among their areas of interest, deities such as Sefagreth and Tykee. Recently, however, the church of Belon has been on the rise again as interest in him as a god of arcane knowledge who can perhaps provide secrets of the ancient magic of the East. Less a travelers' god, it is now more in vogue for wizards who consider themselves to be sophisticated and well-traveled to venerate the White Wanderer. This upsurge has been noticed by the clergy of the traditional god of magic Jamboor, and discussions about what to do among that god's scholars have been going on for years now as more and more practitioners of the arcane arts turn to Belon as their patron."

				"Ceres is an old goddess of the Hyperborean pantheon who has protected home and hearth since the earliest recorded histories. She is seen as a motherly figure who protects her followers and their communities through gentle guidance and nurturing. It is also she who the common folk turn to in prayer to avoid famine from a bad harvest or natural calamities. Though not really a goddess of crops and weather like the god {@deity Telophus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Telophus}, her holy writings and liturgy do universally speak of a bountiful harvest to fill the bellies of the community and the needy.",
				"More concerned with the benign use of the harvest from the standpoint of community well-being and stability rather than being seen as a matron of plant growth in general, Ceres is one of the few deities whose worship involves active benevolence in the form of feeding and sheltering the needy. She is revered by many who are not truly her worshippers (hence her title of \"Revered Mother\") because she is seen as the divine caretaker and overseer of healthy births, though she shares this role with the goddess {@deity Freya|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Freya}. So even those who venerate other gods or are even diametrically opposed to her through alignment or creed are not above uttering short prayer in her name at the birth of their own offspring. In her hands lies the well-being of the next generation, which all humans recognize and generally respect. That her followers are not crusaders or violent radicals seeking to bring judgment in her name makes this veneration by others more palatable.",
				"For all of these qualities and that of providing succor to the sick, Ceres is often seen as the glue that holds families and communities together.The few hospices that exist for the indigent or those unable to afford the services of a personal physician are almost always established by her worshippers.Despite her recognized benevolence, Ceres is seen as somewhat rustic, and has been in decline in some urban centers. She retains her popularity and influence in the countryside among the simple folk, however.The halfling matron goddess Hester serves as her handmaiden, and many rural halflings revere Ceres as well as a result."

There are entire sects of elves who venerate the Lost Queen and her search through the rare appearances of the blue comet Rialae, though Darach-Albith for his part seems to remain stoic in the face of his unending grief."

				"Dre'uain appears as a clubfooted gnome with strong but fine-fingered hands. His flame-red hair and beard always appear singed from his labors over the forge. He has a long nose and piercingly curious eyes and wears a soot-covered apron. Hammer Mittelschmerz claims to have learned all he knows of crafting and invention from Dre'uain.",
				"Considered by many to be one of the oldest deities, Dre'uain embodies the creative mind and its ability to fashion objects and devices. Dre'uain is honored by creators, inventors, smiths, architects, and other craftsfolk of all races. His connection to earthquakes, volcanoes, and other seismic events seem to be a holdover from his earliest days as a mighty giant and arth deity. In that capacity early myths say that he battled the primordial earth spirit Demogorgon for supremacy. The result of the battle was the crippling of Dre'uain and the reduction to his current stature as well as his loss of mastery over the earth, turning instead to mastery of its resources in invention and crafting. Demogorgon faired perhaps worse, losing his mastery over the earth in exchange for knowledge of its deepest secrets instead but at the cost of having his psyche split into two competing halves and being cast into the Ginnungagap.",
				"Since then Dre'uain has succeeded in one of the most difficult tasks in all the multiverse; he was a gnome god who ascended to a position of respect and major worship among humans, with many adherents among dwarves and halflings as well. While dwarven crafters and inventors are more likely to venerate Dwerfater or Crugas and Dre'uain has not been adopted into the Dwarven Pantheon as a result, there are still a fair number of dwarven craftsmen and smiths who prefer to follow his faith than the more magically oriented tenants of Crugas or the distinctly racial patronage of Dwerfater, especially among the hill dwarves who work more closely with other races.",
				"Among humans, Dre'uain not only receives veneration among inventors, craftsmen, and smiths, but his propensity for hard work and virtue of honest labors has endeared him to all manner of manual laborers. Many such laborers follow Stryme, seeing the work of the god of strength in their labors, but for those whose work is less reliant upon physical prowess and more reliant on dogged determination or dedication to tedious or repetitive tasks, Dre'uain strikes a chord. The laborers or many manufactories turn to Dre'uain for their common beliefs and has resulted in the formation of labor unions in some locales.",
				"The presence of Dre'uain's own clubbed foot as a model, and the tendency of some of his followers to unionize has created a following of maimed workers among his followers. This has likewise contributed to a growing number of wounded veteran soldiers among those who follow him, turning away from their former soldier gods in their disability and looking instead to Dre'uain to sustain them. An unexpected side effect of this is that an ever-growing number of beggars\u2014crippled and healthy alike\u2014are beginning to flock to faith. This latest development has created a great deal of discomfort and growing resentment among his clergy because many of these beggars are seen as individuals who eschew hard work in favor of the charity of others, which flies in the face of the very tenants of Dre'uain. Despite many temples openly preaching against the sin of sloth to discourage this or any affiliation with those they see as ne'er-do-wells, any number of almshouses and soup kitchens continue to pop up in Dre'uian's name, though not formally associated with actual members of the clergy. The church hierarchy has yet to come up with a good solution to this situation and are divided as to whether a solution is even necessary.",
				"Dre'uain is frequently associated with the elven deity known as Wayland the Smith (Weland the Smith among the Tuatha De Pantheon). Many assume they are the same god by different names and in different aspects.The dwarves vehemently deny any suggestion of this, and the churches of Dre'uain and Wayland maintain themselves as entirely separate entities. If there is a connection between Dre'uain and Wayland, neither deity has deigned to comment.",
				"Dre'uain's temples always contain an altar composed of large metal gears intended to represent the eternal mechanisms of the cosmos, which Dre'uain is said to understand and perhaps even serve as caretaker over.True members of Dre'uain's clergy can be identified by their ability to disassemble the interlocking cogs of Dre'uain's holy symbols or connect them back together. This secret, known as the \"Blessing of Dre'uain\", is given to them directly from the god. Others who attempt to do so must make a successful DC 45 Disable Device check."

				"The Father has existed as long as there has been life on the world now known as Lloegyr and has often been associated as an embodiment of the world itself or its primordial oceans. He has been known by many names through the ages, The Father simply being the most universal and enduring. To the ancient Phoromyceans who knew of him only through their own ancient legends, he was known as the Demiurge. To the Hyperboreans, who came along an age later, he was known as Boros and represented the planet upon which they lived as well as their home continent to the north. To the ancient peoples of the North before the coming of the Northlanders he was Buri, the grandfather of Wotan. To the Khemitite priest-kings of old he was Nun. The even more ancient Ashurians called him Engur or Abzu. The most ancient writings of Far Jaati refer to him as Dyaus Pitra, and to the Ancient Folk of Akados he was Lir.",
				"Worship of The Father predated the formation of pantheons and culturally defined religions; in fact, the existence of The Father seems to predate the concept of worship or even the existence of humanoid life on Lloegyr.To these early cultures, The Father was known as patron of tribal warfare,competition for scarce resources, survival, dominance, and rulership by might, and he was seen as a primal creator of the world, life, and the gods themselves. The Father was typically not so much revered as feared, for the savage world was harsh and unforgiving with an equally harsh and unforgiving god for the strong to cling to and the weak to perish before. Ritual bloodshed marked the holy times and sites of The Father, and human sacrifice became a standard practice under his stern gaze.",
				"Despite this near hegemony of devotion in the earliest ages of the world, worship for and even memory of The Father eventually died out, supplanted by belief in younger, gentler gods, many of whom are believed to be his children or even their offspring. Only in the most ancient records and esoteric circles is mention of The Father even found and usually then only disjointed and incomplete references. To those few with the depth of scholarship or requisite age (a few of the oldest elves and assorted dragons and undead beings) to even know of The Father, it is believed his eventual decline and erasure from the consciousness of humanity was in large part to the heroic and selfless actions of an equally primeval creator deity known only as The Goddess, mother of many of the oldest gods and both mate and mortal enemy of The Father. Thanks to her efforts, knowledge of The Father was forgotten from the world to the point that he is now considered a \"lost\" deity. None in this day and age revere The Father, nor is there liturgy available to revive his worship, except among a very few small and scattered tribal societies that exist as holdovers from those most ancient of times. Even in these cultures worship of The Father is corrupted and inexact due to lack of any written record, and such peoples themselves are in decline is well so that it is only a matter of time until The Father ceases to exist as a deific entity upon Lloegyr."

As societies advanced and maintenance of water sources and the ability to find them became more sophisticated and reliable, her role as the protector of the community transformed somewhat into that of protector of travel and trade upon the waters of her streams and rivers.

Knowledge of this aspect is largely lost among human cultures today, though some prostitutes (usually in riverside communities) venerate the Sparkling Maiden for her seductive qualities, probably related to her relation to fey such as nymphs and {@creature nereid|tftyp|nereids} that are known for their beauty and allure. Her ancient background is further recalled vaguely in old wives' tales about the dangers of visiting the local spring or well at night because the Water Lady might come and steal the foolish visitor. That this could be a reference to Kamien and the sometimes predatory fey among her followers is a possibility, though it could just as easily be nothing more than a parental admonition to children to avoid drownings and other water accidents while unsupervised."

				"The plucky and puckish God of Halflings, Mick O'Delving is the consummate prankster and ne'er-do-well. However, whereas the gnomish god Hammer Mittelschmerz represents the gnomes' propensity for elaborate jokes and tricks, Mick is much more about finding the advantage in any situation by hook or crook and making his way with a smile on his face, a twinkle in his eye, and always one eye on the authorities. His ability to get into trouble is surpassed only by his ability to get out again. He exemplifies the halflings' ability to survive under almost any circumstances while maintaining a certain humorous and affable outlook on life.",
				"According to fables, Mick's first appearance occurred when some of the dwarven miners serving in the mines of the god Vergrimm Earthsblood complained to him about one miner who refused to wear his boots. Vergrimm descended into the depths to investigate where he found the unusually short, barefoot miner hammering away at a workface with his pickaxe while humming a jaunty tune, much to the annoyance of the dwarves laboring around him. When Vergrimm lifted the brim of his too-large helmet he met the eyes of the grimy-faced halfling good smiling merrily. Why Mick was laboring away in the dwarven mines is a question that the fables fail to answer beyond the fact that he thought it would be a grand joke upon the dwarves. Regardless, his propensity for delving and interminable sense of humor served as a perfect counterpoint to the dour dwarven god such that the two became fast friends and known drinking companions. The fact that Pekko often attends their late-night drinking bouts only adds to the legendarium of Mick and is probably the source of his nickname in many a drunken toast as Mickey Two-Cups, for the ale jack that he holds in each hand. His peculiar origins cause many dwarves to refer to him as the Little Miner, an appellation to which halflings usually take umbrage, though if it bothers Mick himself he has never said so.",
				"Despite his merry, even happy-go-lucky reputation, all of the mythology of Mick is not so jolly. The god's first wife was the goddess Sotheryn, known as Lady Suzanne among the halflings. A goddess of community, fertility, and the life-death cycle, there's was a marriage of balance and happiness with her calming, quiet demeanor serving to offset and soothe his over-enthusiastic, almost manic nature. Yet eternal happiness was not to be even among the gods, for one of Mick O'Delving's many pranks mortally offended the Queen of Spiders, vindictive goddess of the drow, and she plotted to murder him. Lady Suzanne managed to learn of the plot at the last second and drank the poison intended for him, saving him but at the cost of her own life. Perhaps the most famous composition by any halfling bard is the Lay of Sotheryn, penned in honor of the Lady Suzanne.",
				"This incident is also what has spawned own of the most peculiar organizations in the history of halflings, a secret society of halfling assassins known as the Barefeet. These folk lead seemingly normal halfling lives as farmers, brewers, bakers, or any other mundane and otherwise humble trade typically found among halflings, but all the way they wage a clandestine war against the drow and the clergy of the Queen of Spiders in particular. Spying, gathering information, and training in secret, these seemingly ordinary folk carefully plan and orchestrate deadly attacks against their hated foes at opportune moments. The local tailor might close up his shop one day to \"go visit his cousin in the next town over.\" Meanwhile in the next town over a halfling barber closes up shop to \"attend his aunt's funeral in the city,\" with the pattern repeating itself again and again across multiple communities. Then a week or so later, they return to reopen shops and resume business and life as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, while in some other location not far away a drow caravan or delegation of drow clerics is found completely slaughtered by unknown assailants.",
				"After the death of his first wife, Mick O'Delving later married the halfling goddess Hester, Handmaiden of {@deity Ceres|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Ceres} and Mother of the Hearthfire.Theirs is a relationship less ideal than that of his first marriage, with the calm and dignified Hester providing counterpoint to Mick's often wild ways, but lacking the serenity enjoyed by her predecessor. Legends speak of the arguments that have occurred in the household of Mick O'Delving, and halfling children say that the thunder is another pot or pan flung by Hester at her wayward husband. Despite these high-spirited bouts their love is genuine, though some quiet whispers speak of Hester finding love with a mortal halfling causing clerics of both faiths to offer up prayers seeking shelter from any coming turmoil."

				"Mitra has become one of the most commonly worshipped gods in Akados, despite being a transplant from eastern lands. Part of Mitra's appeal is his emphasis on humility among his worshippers while at the same time championing justice and rule of law. Thus while the powers-that-be worship Mitra to uphold their rightful rule and the laws of the land, he is appealing to the common folk for his insistence on the principles of mercy and fairness among the high and low alike. Another god that probably found its way into Akados through the crusading knights of the Foerdewaith, Mitra's true rise to prominence in the West undoubtedly stems from a single incident some 700 years ago when he allegedly appeared to the Foerdewaith overking, Osbert II, before the pivotal battle of Oescreheit Downs promising victory for the beleaguered Foerdewaith against the vastly superior numbers of the Heldring horde. When the Heldring were defeated and their threat finally broken once and for all, many took Mitra's appearance to mean that he favored the rightful rule of the Foerdewaith overkings and adopted him as the patron of Macobert's dynasty.",
				"The shift as a result of this changing attitude was gradual and took place only in small incremental steps, but its progress has been inexorable.The adoption of Mitra as a specifically Macobertian sponsor largely pushed the traditional recognition of Quell in that role to the side until recent centuries when the most devout loyalty to the Sea King has largely shifted to the maritime Empire of Oceanus. Other gods that have felt the greatest decline as a result of Mitra's rise are the sun goddess {@deity Solanus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Solanus} (to such an extent that many folk of Akados have begun to refer to the sun as Mitra in the Eastern fashion rather than as Sol or {@deity Solanus|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Solanus} as has been traditionally done in the West), {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir} as a Lawful war goddess,and {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} in his role of Lawgiver and god of justice. At point in time, virtually every judge and court in Akados looked to {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr} as its patron, but now Mitra predominates in that role by a narrow margin, and his influence in the areas of the sun and healing ensures that his adherents' growth continues even as {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr's} declines."

				"Solanus is the benevolent goddess of the sun, Sol as it has traditionally been named in Akados. She is a goddess of ancient Hyperborea who, as a founding deity of that culture, has known great popularity in Akados across the breadth of the empire. Her priests have often served as field medics in armies and once comprised an entire Legion of ancient Hyperborea. They have also commonly been the local healers in villages and small towns. Some hospitals were established in Solanus's name in certain imperial centers (namely Remenos and Curgantium), but the practice never caught on in more remote settings where sufficient funds from the imperial coffers were frequently unavailable. As a result, her rural clergyremained principally scattered as individual practitioners while her central high church maintained a rigid hierarchy that often looked with disdain upon the rural church as disorganized or even bumpkins. Perhaps the church's greatest claim to notoriety over the centuries, however, has been the propensity for members of her rural clergy to join adventuring bands. At one time in the empire's history, it is likely that as many as 8 out of 10 adventuring parties, mercenary companies, or freelance knights was accompanied by a cleric of Solanus, bringing great acceptance and goodwill among the common folk far beyond what could have been managed by the central offices of the church tucked away in the great cities of the empire. Many of the older bardic hero tales composed in the classical style of those times include a warrior of {@deity Thyr|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Thyr}, a wizard of {@deity Jamboor|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Jamboor}, a paladin of {@deity Muir|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Muir}, and a cleric of Solanus as heroic archetypes. (They also typically include a scoundrel character devoted to Moccavallo, though this is less likely to be acknowledged in polite company.) ",
				"In recent centuries the church of Solanus has seen a steady, and in some cases precipitous, decline. This can be directly attributed to the equally steady rise in the encroaching faith of {@deity Mitra|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} from the far reaches of the East after being embraced by the Foerdewaith overkings several centuries ago. In general her worship becomes more common the farther west one travels across Akados, as the faith of {@deity Mitra|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Mitra} has not yet spread that far. Solanus is one of the three matron/patron deities of the great city of Reme (alongside Dame Torren and Mithras) and still enjoys a great degree of popularity and worship there. Her High Altar remains in that city at the venerable Hospital of St. Jethra the Martyred which still maintains 1,220 beds and accepts the sick and infirm from all over Akados who make their way to its doors."

The lawful aspect of his nature reflects this adherence to the strict natural cycles of day and night, sun and storm, and the endless revolution of the seasons. One result of this detached view of the process is that some strange druidic cults of Telophus have emerged over the centuries that take a distinctly anti-civilization view. Whether this more-malicious interpretation of his faith is bothersome to the deity is unclear, as he has never commented to his priesthood on it in one way or the other."

In fact, it is not entirely certain that he is truly aspects of the same god (though the belief of that is near universal). Regardless, Thyr does not seem to raise any objection to the correlation, and his Thyr identity has by far been his largest church historically. The modern Heldring have formed an almost-theocratic society devoted to Tyr and Eostre (their name for Muir), and their hledwalda petitions annually for the High Altar of Thyr to be moved from Bard's Gate to Kingsgardt in the Kingdom of the Helcynn, while the empress of the actual-theocracy of Alcaldar likewise presses for it to be established in the imperial capital of Mhaltra.

However, his high priest notes that this decline cannot be fully laid at the feet of the upstart Mitra, because it actually precedes his dramatic appearance to Overking Osbert II seven centuries ago. Rather, High Priest Bofred of Bard's Gate points out that the first hints of the decline had occurred even before the end of the Hyperborean Empire, much less the current decline of the Foerdewaith in recent centuries, pointing to a subtle but pervasive omnipresent diminishment in civilization over this time period. A diminishment that Bofred and others fear may be a harbinger of worse things to come."

For his role in imparting knowledge upon the mortal races, libraries and archives are often dedicated to Yenomesh, and many have at least one small shrine in his honor.",
				"Despite the universality of Yenomesh's contributions to the world in the form of writing, he was not always considered to be a part of the Hyperborean pantheon. Originally Yenomesh was found only in the ancient religions of the East. It was during the Hyperborean expansion into Libynos some three-and-a-half thousand years ago that the West encountered the monastics of Yenomesh. They later recognized the value and contributions of the Yenomeshi faith when Hyperborean scholarship realized that all known languages were derived from a script that the monastics used to write their own scrolls. As scholars practiced in the arcane arts discovered that this Foundation language also served as the basis for magical writings, western wizards began to show interest in the faith as well. Yenomesh has never had sufficient popularity among magical practitioners that it threatened the faith of {@deity Jamboor|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Jamboor} or later {@deity Belon the Wise|Lostlands|TheLostLands|Belon the Wise}, but he has also had a small and devoted following of these spellcasters who delve deeply into the mysteries of alternate forms of magical writing."

				"This foul frog-demon cares less about the machinations of men and power than he does about obliterating light and life with slow, oozing sickness and decay. He is the vicious dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth. Making his home on the plane of Tarterus at the mouth of the vast swamp of filth deposited by the River Styx as it flows out of the Abyss, Tsathogga's main form is a colossally bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs andfingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul humors and fluids that leak into the vile swamp in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that all of the slime and filth from the River Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy maw. He never moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible shrieking. Tsathogga commands a host of evil creatures\u2014notably evil aberrations and his own vile frog race, the tsathar. Thousands of fawning tsathar servants continuously bathe his body in fetid slime from the evil swamp, awaiting the divine bliss of being randomly devoured by him. His hatred of light and lack of human worshippers (though there are a few notable exceptions) mean that he is little known to surface races. He has had few organized centers of worship and no standardized holy symbol\u2014each worshipper choosing its own way to best depict his deific vileness. Occasionally, tsathar priests of Tsathogga on Tarterus sculpt a small likeness of him out of foul chunks of solid waste from the Styx that harden into a vile green substance similar to soapstone when taken from that plane. Such items are prized as holy relics."
