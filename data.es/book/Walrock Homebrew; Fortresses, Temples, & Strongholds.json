						"A castle on a wind-swept cliff, overlooking a verdant bone-strewn valley where an ancient battle took place. Set against the seaside, an open-air ivory-columned temple spreads its arms wide to welcome in the elements. At a dusty crossroads, a lone trading post invites all travelers, specially those with purses filled with gold, or lips laden with rumors.",
						"As storied as these locations may be, they were all founded at one point by historical figures. Bold, noteworthy folk of many walks of life, who invested coin and manpower into building these landmarks for purposes inscrutable, either lost to the passage of time or handed down in song and story between the generations. Immortality is available to all adventurers with sufficient coin, should they wish to build it.",
						"Players often wish to leave their mark on the world, to establish something grand that can survive their characters and change the world around them, making it altogether better, worse, or simply different for its presence. Structures that are created by the characters are an excellent opportunity for roleplaying, quests, and story, being an instantly visible and prominent part of the world to those in regions nearby.",
						"A structure included in a game is typically both a focal point of the campaign and an investment opportunity for the player characters. The more gold and time characters spend expanding, improving, and staffing their structure, the more benefits, defense, and utility it provides. A well-governed structure can act as a military bastion, a powerful trading hub, ir the spiritual center of a faith, and those that control the structure may stand as the stewards of the fates of millions."

						"Should players wish to build a structure, they must pay the associated construction fee and invest the proper construction time to build it, as indicated on the Buildable Structures table. If this structure will be on owned land in a kingdom or other governed region, players must typically buy the land to be allowed to build by the government, at a price determined by its size and location. The price of land typically runs between 100 gp and 1000 gp for a small to well-sized plot, but can stretch upwards of 5,000 gp for a large, expansive plot. The DM determines land prices, and not all land is inherently for sale.",
						"The cost of construction includes materials and labor, and players need not be present during construction. Ifa character is present and contributes to labor each for the entire duration of the construction time, you may reduce the structure's total cost by a percentage equal to half the character's level, rounded up. Multiple characters may work on a structure for its entire construction time in this way to secure this benefit multiple times.",
