						"¿Es más importante el destino o el viaje? En el Rail-Away, el equipo industrial ha decidido ofrecer ambas cosas. Las vías de esta taberna ambulante pueden atravesar cualquier número de lugares para adaptarse a tu campaña: por encima y por debajo de la tierra, entre ciudades y pueblos, por el campo, por las montañas o por la costa. La pista puede ser circular para un bucle infinito que te lleve de vuelta al punto de partida, o un viaje de principio a fin con aventuras a lo largo del camino. Como variante para jugar utilizando este libro, el Rail-Away puede servir como barco de crucero que visita todas las demás tabernas en orden.",
						"Las aventuras que se encuentran en la Taberna están pensadas para personajes de nivel 5 a 10. La taberna puede jugarse como un lugar temporal, que sirve de respiro a las aventuras peligrosas. Alternativamente, puedes jugar a través de su combinación de misiones y un evento de misterio de asesinato utilizando los NPCs proporcionados.",
						"Aunque la frecuencia con la que el Rail-Away se detiene en las estaciones queda a discreción del GM, algunas misiones requieren al menos un día de viaje entre paradas para que los personajes de los jugadores tengan tiempo para aventurarse. Las paradas también pueden ser instigadas por el reabastecimiento de combustible, las transiciones de los pasajeros, o la adición de carros de carga.",

Aunque el exterior del vagón es del mismo nivel que el resto del tren, el interior está desnudo y sin decorar.

A particularly hot-headed youth with an anger problem, Raivo was cursed by an ancient and powerful efreeti during an argument (one that he has forgotten the cause of, so frequent and inconsequential were his disagreements). The most prevalent effect of this curse is Raivo's hair, which acts like opaque fire. When his mood is good, the \"flames\" are low lying, barely flickering, but as his anger grows the flames grow stronger and gain real heat. Touching his hair when he is noticeably angry deals {@dice 1d8} fire damage.",

										"Raivo uses the {@creature gladiator} statistics, with a few additional abilities. He uses empty bottles and glasses in the place of spears, and a steel serving tray instead of a shield. Raivo also knows the cantrips mage hand and minor illusion, which he learned from his elven mother. He has proficiency in Herbalism, Brewing, and Alchemy, all of which assist him in creating his sometimes magical cocktails.",
										"The curse placed on him by the efreeti is so powerful that it cannot be removed by a normal {@spell remove curse} spell. Casting remove curse on him will instead have a rebound effect where Raivo and the caster both feel sweltering heat for the next 24 hours, suffering from a level of exhaustion that cannot be removed by magical means. There are rumors that a {@spell greater restoration} spell would work, but Raivo\u2014concerned about possible counter-curse effects\u2014has not tried it.",
										"Depending on his anger level, Raivo can create different special cocktails (see the Cocktail Menu). However, there is a danger that, if provoked enough, he will vault over the bar and attack. He avoids outright killing people, but some bar-goers need to be taught a lesson.",

Her build is slim and wiry, accented by leather armor dyed black underneath her cloak. Her hair falls in two braids. She has a small scar at the corner of her mouth, but smiles pleasantly if spoken to. She mostly stays to her room."
