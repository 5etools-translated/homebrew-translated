								"The grotesque, violent game of Cackleball is a firm favorite with Scarthey's students, and the annual Varsity Cup is a highlight of the University's calendar.",
								"Cackleball is played with a severed goblin head. Before play, the umpire casts {@spell speak with dead} (or {@spell magic mouth}) on the head, causing it to cackle manically during the game. The objective of the sport is to outscore the opposing team by defending the head while it rests atop a small pyramid shaped mound within your own half of the field. Each beat of the drum - roughtly every second - score the team a point. Getting the head to pronounce you the winner is worth a significant 20 points. The drummer keeps a beat for 2 minutes a third (20 rounds), with the game going to the team with the highest score at the end.",
								"Crackleball teams consist of an equal number of prowlers, who must remain within their half of the field, and raiders, who may enter the opponent's half to capture the head. Each team is allowed a number of substitutions, decided before the match. Quarterstaffs, wands, and magic are allowed, and players may use these as well as full contact to secure and defend the head. The rules of cackleball strictly prohibited killing, but are otherwise tolerant of most strategies."

								"To run a rowing contest, mark out 11 squares on a sheet of paper. Each racer starts in the first square. next, each rower makes a Strength check, with all by the lowest advancing one block. Repeat this two more times, then have each rower make a Constitution check, with the lowest result not advancing. The entire race follows this pattern unitl the final strength check, when only the lead rower with the highest total advances, crossing under the causeway and making them the winner.",
