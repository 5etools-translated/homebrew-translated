También incluye cosas que han sido creadas indirectamente por el incomprensible saber de los Antiguos: mutantes y accidentes con forma de carne, descendientes de experimentos, etc.",

								"\"La numenera\" es un término que se refiere a todo lo que parece sobrenatural y que proviene de las épocas anteriores que precedieron incluso a los Elfos Mayores. Desde el punto de vista del siglo XXI, esto significa dispositivos, máquinas, vehículos, robots, ordenadores, armas, satélites, drogas, etc. Pero también significa criaturas de bioingeniería, seres cibernéticos y criaturas traídas desde mundos alienígenas de otros sistemas solares o dimensiones más allá de las que normalmente se entienden como parte de la cosmología. En otras palabras, no se trata sólo de alta tecnología, sino también de dispositivos que superan incluso nuestra comprensión del siglo XXI, cosas que manipulan el tiempo, el espacio, la gravedad y más.",
								"Sin embargo, es importante recordar que los personajes de los jugadores no ven los numenera como la gente del siglo XXI ve la tecnología. En un mundo de fantasía, un proyector de campo de fuerza y una radio bidireccional parecerían no sólo magia, sino magia del mismo nivel de poder. De hecho, la radio podría parecer más potente porque su uso es más amplio y sus efectos son \"invisibles\". Los personajes con una sensibilidad medieval no tienen ninguna perspectiva sobre qué tipos de tecnología son más avanzados que otros, y no dan nada por sentado.",
								"Es probable que ocurra lo mismo con muchas de las criaturas presentadas en {@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA}. Los plebeyos probablemente pensarán que la mayoría de ellos son simplemente \"demonios\". Los aventureros de PC probablemente aprenderán lo contrario, pero el aldeano medio, el pueblerino, el comerciante o el guardia en un entorno de fantasía no tiene el conocimiento o la perspectiva para imaginar que una cosa de casi 20 pies de altura que tiene hambre de carne es otra cosa que una bestia sobrenatural de pura maldad. Pero en realidad, esta cosa -en este caso un {@creature jiraskar|AotA}- no es un demonio en el sentido planar, sino un depredador supremo, uno de los muchos transportados de alguna manera desde la época de los Antiguos. A pesar de su tamaño, son animales. Pero los peligros que suponen estas criaturas hacen comprensible la percepción de un plebeyo. El concepto de demonio -una entidad espiritualmente maligna- es una etiqueta para amenazas que no se pueden entender. Agrupar a todas las criaturas que tienen hambre de carne y cazan humanos como demonios es claramente simplista. Y lo que es peor, hacerlo así probablemente priva a los lugareños de posibles estrategias para enfrentarse a una criatura de este tipo. A un animal se le puede hacer frente. ¿Pero un demonio?",

Thus, it drives its host (or hosts) into more frequent and more vicious conflicts. The creature to which a hungry pennon makes this attachment may at first value the advantages provided.

The GM can customize them by adjusting size, stats, specifying what form its attacks take (claws, slams, and so on), adding manufactured weapons (swords, rays, or even cyphers or relics), different movement modes, skill bonuses, or even a special ability. These changes should be limited so the GM doesn't have to adjust the automaton's challenge rating. For example, the basic automaton's listed melee attack method is just called \"melee attack\"; it doesn't matter if that's a claw, drill, or blade, and the GM can use the listed attack stats for whatever weapon they decide the automaton is using.
