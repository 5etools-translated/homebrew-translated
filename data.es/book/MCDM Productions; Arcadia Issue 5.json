					"To say that Garin Najis was born with a silver spoon in his mouth would be an understatement\u2014start with platinum, and then change spoons for every bite. After a life of opulence, he should want for nothing, yet all he does is want. His path of avarice started early and only deepened.",
					"Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy. When he came of age and his parents decided to teach him how to manage the mines, he was initially horrified. They exploited their miners for little pay and forced them to work in dangerous conditions under strict contracts that prevented departure.",
					"Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it. But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to Pta'u to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied. He convinced his workers that their labor in his service was a path to the divine. Their hard work, sweat, and tears would lead to countless rewards in the next life... and countless rewards in this life for Garin.",
					"A prosperity preacher of the highest order, Garin keeps a close counsel of powerful, mercenary-minded adventurers and commands a loyal following of brainwashed cult-like laborers who literally die to hand him a freshly mined gem. Garin can be found most often managing his various enterprises, but as of late he has felt the itch of adventure and has taken to traveling in search of more resources (both material and humanoid) to exploit.",
					"Garin never faces down an enemy without a well-prepared battlefield or plenty of minions. His primary strategy is to keep as much cannon fodder between him and his foes while simultaneously bolstering his legions and himself. He makes good use of his Prophet Motive feature to keep buffs on his allies and himself while using spells like {@spell guardian of faith} and {@spell spirit guardians} to control the battlefield to his liking. He is a coward at heart and will leave his minions to die if he sees the tides turning against him."

								"To say that Garin Najis was born with a silver spoon in his mouth would be an understatement\u2014start with platinum, and then change spoons for every bite. After a life of opulence, he should want for nothing, yet all he does is want. His path of avarice started early and only deepened.",
								"Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy. When he came of age and his parents decided to teach him how to manage the mines, he was initially horrified. They exploited their miners for little pay and forced them to work in dangerous conditions under strict contracts that prevented departure.Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it.",
								"But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to Pta'u to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied. He convinced his workers that their labor in his service was a path to the divine. Their hard work, sweat, and tears would lead to countless rewards in the next life... and countless rewards in this life for Garin.",
								"A prosperity preacher of the highest order, Garin keeps a close counsel of powerful, mercenary-minded adventurers and commands a loyal following of brainwashed cult-like laborers who literally die to hand him a freshly mined gem. Garin can be found most often managing his various enterprises, but as of late he has felt the itch of adventure and has taken to traveling in search of more resources (both material and humanoid) to exploit.",
								"Garin never faces down an enemy without a well-prepared battlefield or plenty of minions. His primary strategy is to keep as much cannon fodder between him and his foes while simultaneously bolstering his legions and himself. He makes good use of his Prophet Motive feature to keep buffs on his allies and himself while using spells like {@spell guardian of faith} and {@spell spirit guardians} to control the battlefield to his liking. He is a coward at heart and will leave his minions to die if he sees the tides turning against him.",

I hope they ignite your imagination, as they do mine.",
