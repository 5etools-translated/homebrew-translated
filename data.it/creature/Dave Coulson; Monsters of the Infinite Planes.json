					"Warden archons are powerfully built humanoids with the head and paws of a bear. A smooth coat of fur covers their muscular bodies and they rarely wear armor, preferring belts, girdles, and shoulder pads for their celestial ornamentation. Warden archons are charged with protecting gates and portals, normally leading into and out of Mount Celestia, but some units of warden archons have been given orders to keep guard over other portals as well across the multiverse. In many planar metropolises, such as the City of Glass on the Plane of Water and Ravnica the City of Guilds, the presence of a warden archon is a sure sign of a gate to the Seven Heavens."

									"A common occurrence on the Plain of Infinite Portals is the running of the blackhides, a great stampede of the monsters. It occurs when one of the manu pits on the layer expels a great plume of magic from somewhere lower in the Abyss. The resulting black cloud drives the blackhides to frenzy, and they rush about in herds seeking to destroy everything they can. Pazuzu and his flying ilk are fond of dropping travelers into the fray, taking bets on how long a victim lasts before they are trampled, gored, or slashed to death by the rampaging horde."

No two scrap golems are exactly the same, but they are all constructed with powerful fire magic that fuels their inner workings."

The Necromancer King that wanders Acheron found a solution to this problem with the creation of the ironbone. ",

In addition, the iron can be shaped, and the Necromancer King's legion of ironbone warriors have elongated claws as sharp as blades."

									"A nereid protects her shawl with every fiber of her being, and with good reason. If the nereid's shawl ever be destroyed, the fey is destined to expire within a day. Some nereids tell the tale of Ciellieri, an ancient nereid who lost her shawl to a cruel wizard long ago. It is rumored that Ciellieri was able to fashion a new shawl to save her own life, but the transition warped and twisted the fey's mind and body. Some say that Ciellieri is still somewhere in the Darkened Depths of the Plane of Water, hiding away in some shadowed cave, plotting revenge against the playful nereid that squander the joy she was robbed of so long ago."

Its black skin melds perfectly in dark surroundings, and they eschew weapons, preferring to use the jagged claws at the end of their sinewy arms to rip foes limb from limb. They move with a surprising speed and grace and are capable of surprise attacks that leave opponents paralyzed with pure panic. A shock of black hair runs from their bony broad heads down their spines, ending in rough ebony fur covering their hindquarters. "

The centaurs of the Greenway recognize the signs of their approach and move to avoid them, but over the years many of them have fallen prey to the beastwraiths of the pack. Since they are responsible for creating many of the Pack of the Damned, members of the Glorious Conclave are special targets for the horde of beastwraiths. Areas such as Blackstone Lodge are warded against the incursions of such attacks, but many Glorious Conclave hunters know better than to stand and fight against the pack out in the Beastlands."

He was searching for a fey creature for sport, and in coming to the Feywild he was led to a small village of tiny fey folk. Cruel and uncaring, the noble scattered or killed the helpless creatures and stole rare herbs from their home. His actions brought down the wrath of an archfey, who cursed the noble and transformed him into a massive boar that would forever be linked to the Plane of Faerie as a hideous defender. Since then, more triath have appeared, though it is unclear whether they are all cursed mortals who upset an archfey or if the Plane of Faerie has spawned them naturally in the intervening years."
