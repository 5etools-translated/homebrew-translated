A creature that is immune to being {@condition charmed} is not affected by the illusion.",

Creatures outside of the dome and uncharmed creatures inside the dome see a dark but translucent covering instead of a pure black wall. Charmed creatures inside the dome take the black dome to be the night sky, stars shimmering brightly in every direction. A huge gibbard moon shines with brilliant white light above an elven forest that resembles the Feywild inside of this illusion. Woodwind music whistles throughout the illusory night, and small ponds of still water reside next to riverbanks lined with rows of blossoming crystal flowers, seemingly dancing in the light breeze.",
				"A creature {@condition charmed} by the illusion enters a peaceful state of mind, sees and hears no other creatures, loses concentration, and is hypnotized by the gleaming light of the large moon. It hears and sees nothing from outside the sphere, and cannot receive information via divination spells or telepathically. It loses its bonus action and reaction and must use its movement every turn to move as close as it can to the point directly underneath the moon at the center of the sphere, and must use its action to {@action Dash} if not there yet. Otherwise, it loses its action on that turn. A creature that ends its turn inside of the illusion gains 10 temporary hit points, as beautiful naturistic music plays through its head. A creature can have a maximum of 80 temporary hit points granted by the music of the spell. A {@condition charmed} creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it is no longer {@condition charmed}, and can attempt to run out of the illusion. The area affected by the spell is considered difficult terrain.",
				"If a {@condition charmed} creature takes damage from a source outside of the sphere, it is no longer {@condition charmed}. When the spell ends or when a creature leaves the area of effect, it loses all its temporary hit points given by the spell, if any. The creature then must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking psychic damage equal to 40 + the amount of cumulative temporary hit points granted by this spell on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This damage can not exceed 120."

In this case, if you do succeed in finding the emerald, it is guaranteed that you will meet this willing archfey. Divine beings are not necessarily omniscient, so if your deity does not know exactly how to respond without being misleading, or if a scenario is too easily changeable, they will reply with \"unsure\" and the spell ends. For example, asking your deity whether you will find true love one day may be met with \"unsure\" as a response.",

The more unlikely a prophecy is to be fulfilled, or the more extreme a goal is, the harder it is to find the key to success and the easier it is to fall for the foreboding omen. Only one prophecy can apply to a single creature at a time. If you attempt to request for a second prophecy before the first one is fulfilled on the same creature, your spell slot will be consumed and nothing happens. Once either the prophecy is fulfilled or if the DM decides it is not possible for the key to be found (the emerald is disintegrated in the previous example), the spell ends, the creature is made aware, and a new prophecy can now be applied.",
						"Casting this spell requires your deity to come up with a difficult answer as to not mislead you, and so you may or may not receive your prophecy immediately. If your deity responds immediately, the green smoke above the cauldron will display your prophecy to you visually, and maybe audibly. If not, then during the creature's next long rest, it will be visited by the god in its dreams, and it will receive it then. Attempting to cast prophecy again in the time before you or the creature receives an answer will force you to lose your spell slot without any effect."

A creature casting this spell that is not of a good alignment fails to connect to a deity willing to send down this mote of divine power, expending the spell slot and ending the spell. If you see the sky and it is clear, the column of light seemingly descends from a point infinitely high up. Any clouds obstructing the path automatically disperse to form a large 100-foot radius circular area where the beam can pass through. If underground or in a place where the sky is not present, the roof where you center the column opens a bright divine fissure allowing the column to strike down, seemingly having come from an extraplanar dimension. Bright light extends out from the column in all directions to 150 feet, and dim light shines out to 150 feet beyond that. The light is considered natural light, extends around corners, and remains for the duration of the spell.",

Until the spell ends, a creature within 20 feet of the center of the column is immune to all conditions that reduce the creature's speed to 0.",

Additionally, the creature takes {@damage 8d10} radiant damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. This 40-foot radius is also considered difficult terrain and the bright light rays that extend from the column makes the area lightly obscured.",
				"If the spell lasts for the full duration, the divine light imprints a holy symbol into the ground where it is cast. As the column retracts upwards, a glowing runic symbol relating to the deity that facilitated the spell's casting appears in the burnt crater that the light created. Soft white sparks fly out of the symbol and it gives off a low hiss that resembles the sound of radiant fire. The symbol emits dim light out to 20 feet, and any creature not of a good alignment that enters the 10-foot area for the first time on their turn or starts its turn there takes 50 radiant damage. The symbol remains inscribed in the ground for 1 hour."
