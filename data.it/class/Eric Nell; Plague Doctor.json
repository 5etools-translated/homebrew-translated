						"Meandering through a blighted village, a halfling kneels beside the emaciated body of a human child. The child's lips are dry and cracked, her skin covered in blackened sores. The halfling waits patiently, peering through the lenses of his mask. There it is; a slight rising of the child's chest. She breathes still. Hurrying, the halfling opens his medicine bag and quickly mixes together a handful of herbs and curious liquids, tipping the small vial into the child's mouth. She may survive yet.",
						"Bearing her torch aloft, a human steps quietly through the catacombs that crawl beneath the city. She listens for a moment, and in the distance she makes out a soft sound; an anguished moaning, echoing along the walls of the crypt. Pulling her blade and whispering an incantation to protect against the abominations, she creeps forward, leaping at the last moment to remove the head of the creature that has been spreading disease and suffering throughout her city.",
						"Crows wheel overhead as the half-elf picks their footing carefully through the battlefield. The fog of war has cleared, but a miasma still hangs over the area. They had watched the battle from the encampment, and now that it was over, they searched for survivors. As they inspected a body for any signs of life, an enemy combatant rises from the ground and lunges at the half-elf. They back peddle wildly, crying out a curse at their assailant. The warrior falls to the ground, choking on his own breath, before toppling over, blood and pus oozing from his lips, his body bloating with abnormal quickness.",

								"Plague Doctors have a fascination, some would say morbid obsession, with biology, death, and disease. Spending many years devoted to the study of the body and the ailments that may afflict it, plague doctors are dedicated to the extermination of pestilence wherever it might try to reach. Some plague doctors spend their time researching and discovering various concoctions that might better prevent or combat plague as it spreads among the populace, while others hone their skills as cunning warriors, dedicating their lives to eradicating with sword and purifying fire any creature that brings illness upon the land. A few plague doctors have become so desensitized to the horrors they witness, or so filled with hatred for these diseases and those who spread them, that they use their vast knowledge to develop their own supernatural plagues to bring to bear against their foes.",
								"In combat, a plague doctor is a valuable ally. Using their tinctures and spells, they can be a boon to their comrades, and a curse to their enemies. A plague doctor approaches combat with a shrewd cunning, remaining beyond the reach of the fray as much as possible to better assist his allies, careful to allocate their assistance where it will be most effective, but close enough that they can rush in and stabilize a fallen friend, or strike down an enemy with violent precision."

Though their work is invaluable, they are also viewed as an ill omen, for where a plague doctor goes, calamity has either struck, or is soon to follow. A few plague doctors have become so twisted by the horrors they see daily, that they become monsters in their own right, and work to undo the efforts of their less twisted brethren.",
								"Some more powerful plague doctors can learn to channel this fear and use it to drive away the enemies of the innocent, instilling terror in in the wicked and and profane. Theirs is a darker side to good works, and rare is the plague doctor who feels that, when it comes to their line of work, the ends don't justify the means."

								"As you create your plague doctor, give some thought to why you pursued such grisly studies. What is it about death and disease that drew you to search it out, when so many others might run away? Did you lose friends and family to plague, and as the survivor, you've developed a burning desire to snuff it out? Perhaps you've always had a fascination with the forces of life and death, and the studies and travels of a plague doctor were a natural progression from childhood inquisitiveness? Are you a nihilist who understands that entropy is a part of the natural order, and you are only playing your own small role in the grander scheme of the multiverse that most people can't even fathom, let alone appreciate? Not all plague doctors work for the greater good, after all.",
								"Consider your relationship to the populace. Most people fear the presence of a plague doctor, though your work is certainly important. How does your character handle being an object of fear, and in some cases, of loathing? Do you embrace and accept it, acknowledging it is a necessary sacrifice in a line of work that is desperately needed in many regions? Or do you resent the people you seek to aid, fighting off the urge to leave the ungrateful wretches to suffer? Or worse, do you cultivate that fear and your gruesome knowledge, turning it against the very people you first swore to help? The life of a plague doctor can certainly be lonely, and few can walk through so many horrors and tragedies and emerge unscathed."
