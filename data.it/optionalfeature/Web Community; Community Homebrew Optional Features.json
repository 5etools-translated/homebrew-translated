The range of the Breath Weapon is doubled and every damage dice turns into the superiority die used. Example: if your Breath Weapon normally deals {@dice 4d6} damage, has 15 ft. cone range and the expended superiority die is a d10, when you use this maneuver, the Breath Weapon would instead deal {@dice 4d10} damage and have 30 ft. cone range.",
