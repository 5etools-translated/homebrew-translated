								"Immaginate di trovarvi nel vostro mondo di D&D preferito. Intorno a voi ci sono foreste, paludi, montagne, paludi, rovine, città e molto altro. Sotto i vostri piedi, ci sono innumerevoli tunnel labirintici e sistemi di caverne, forse persino l'Underdark. Che stiate viaggiando sulla superficie del vostro mondo di D&D preferito o nelle caverne sottostanti, abbiamo una buona idea di come gestire una partita in quell'ambiente.",
								"E se guardassimo in alto? Certo, potrebbe esserci una città di nuvole, ma se guardassimo molto in alto? E se guardassimo una stella e ci chiedessimo cosa c'è lassù? Come facciamo ad andarci? Si potrebbe provare a volare, ma non si arriva lontano prima che l'incantesimo fallisca e la stanchezza prenda il sopravvento. Forse un dirigibile? Come fa il vostro dirigibile a volare quando l'aria dell'atmosfera superiore comincia a rarefarsi?  È una barriera insuperabile per la nostra esplorazione di mondi fantastici?",

								"Wildjammer è un set di regole neutrale ispirato all'ambientazione della campagna di D&D Spelljammer, creata da Jeff Grubb e pubblicata da TSR, Inc. nel 1989 come ambientazione di punta per D&D 2a edizione. Spelljammer ci ha dato i mezzi per portare le nostre avventure nello spazio senza perdere nulla della fantasia essenziale di D&D. Immaginava un universo strutturato in modo tale che tutte le ambientazioni di D&D potessero essere navigabili senza che le regole o il carattere unico di un'ambientazione ne ostacolassero un'altra.  Il vostro personaggio di Faerun (Forgotten Realms) potrebbe viaggiare nello spazio e trovare Oerth (Greyhawk) o Krynn (Dragonlance), o qualsiasi altra ambientazione il DM decida di aggiungere. L'obiettivo di questo Wildjammer è più o meno lo stesso: offrire un set di regole che possa essere usato in una partita di D&D 5a edizione per unire diverse ambientazioni e farlo in modo da non ostacolare il sapore fantasy essenziale di D&D.",

Ci immaginiamo un universo che abbia almeno la parvenza di essere scientifico, con l'impossibile spiegato da una serie di chiacchiere tecnologiche. Non c'è molto in giro che ci porti nello spazio e non aggiunga anche questa parvenza di scienza all'universo.",
										"Wildjammer non è fantascienza o science-fantasy, è space fantasy. L'universo non è intrinsecamente scientifico, è intrinsecamente fantastico. Non è necessario che ogni pianeta sia più o meno sferico, perché non avere un pianeta a forma di ciambella? Perché non avere pianeti che hanno una terra cava al loro interno? Perché non avere stelle coscienti e intelligenti? Dopotutto, questa è fantasia! Il limite è la vostra immaginazione.",
										"Leggendo questo supplemento, sentirete alcune idee davvero assurde che non trovano posto in un universo scientifico. Vorrei sfidarvi a estendere la vostra incredulità mentre leggete questo supplemento, nello stesso modo in cui estendiamo la nostra incredulità quando un monaco corre per 75 piedi su un muro in un solo turno di combattimento. Perché un veliero può volare nello spazio? La magia. Perché le persone non vengono risucchiate nel vuoto dello spazio? È una fantasia. Abbracciatela e godetevi la libertà della fantasia nello spazio!"

										"Come Spelljammer, Wildjammer trae grande influenza dall'Età della Vela e dall'Età d'Oro della Pirateria. Piuttosto che pensare a Wildjammer come a uno Star Trek fantasy, pensatelo più come a Pirati dei Caraibi, ma nello spazio. Pensate a Il pianeta del tesoro, navigando verso l'ignoto per trovare l'equivalente spaziale di un tesoro sepolto nel mare della notte. Siete marinai, solo che invece di navigare nel blu dell'oceano e combattere contro mostri marini, pirati e trovare isole con tesori sepolti, navigate nello spazio, combattendo contro mostri spaziali, pirati e trovando asteroidi con tesori sepolti."

										"Se avete guardato un po' in giro per internet, avrete probabilmente notato che ci sono parecchi progetti come questo che cercano di portare la meraviglia di Spelljammer in D&D 5e. Potreste chiedervi perché ho realizzato questo progetto quando ce ne sono già molti altri in circolazione.",
										"In poche parole, mentre stavo dando un'occhiata a diversi prodotti per giocare a D&D nello spazio, mi sono imbattuto nell'ambientazione della campagna Dark Matter della Mage Hand Press.  Questo libro è un'eccellente ambientazione space opera science-fantasy e un libro di regole, perfetto per chi cerca un'ambientazione in cui Spelljammer incontra Mass Effect. Consiglio vivamente di dargli un'occhiata! Mentre lo leggevo, ho scoperto che il libro aveva un sistema di combattimento navale meravigliosamente intuitivo. Ho deciso di adattare quel sistema al fantasy spaziale di Spelljammer. Così è nato Wildjammer: Altre avventure nello spazio!",
										"Il sistema di combattimento navale si distingue per l'estrema somiglianza con il combattimento terrestre. Ci sono sicuramente alcune differenze, ma come regola generale, le cose nel combattimento navale avvengono in modo simile a come avvengono nel combattimento terrestre. Quando si lancia una balista, non si usa il bonus di attacco della balista, ma il proprio. Quando una nave effettua un tiro salvezza, è il Timoniere che effettua il tiro, non la nave stessa. Con questo sistema, la nave viene trattata come uno strumento che si usa e si migliora man mano che si sale di livello, non come un blocco di statistiche che si usa per questo gioco secondario di D&D."

						"Wildjammer non è una proiezione nel futuro. È una lettera d'amore all'Età della Vela.  Si tratta di un'epoca che va all'incirca dalla fine del 1500 alla metà del 1800, dominata dalla guerra navale, dalle armi a polvere da sparo, dalla pirateria, dalle compagnie commerciali navali e dai corsari. Quest'epoca di esplorazione vide navi enormi con numerosi alberi e vele che viaggiavano attraverso il mondo verso terre lontane. Wildjammer cerca di catturare la stessa sensazione, ma nello spazio.",

Si può avere un nastro d'acqua piatto che scorre dentro e tra gli asteroidi in una cintura di asteroidi su cui navigano le navi tra gli asteroidi galleggianti. Si può avere un pianeta cavo e la gente vive sulla superficie interna. Se volete, metteteci un sole! Potete avere mondi quadrati, mondi triangolari, mondi a disco, mondi tartaruga, qualsiasi cosa! Non siete vincolati dalla fisica, perché questi sono stati creati dagli dei o dalla magia. L'unico limite è la vostra immaginazione!",

								"Ora diciamo che decidete di lasciare il vostro pianeta.  Decidete di salire nel mare della notte e di scoprire cosa c'è lassù. Forse volete vedere la luna da vicino, o viaggiare verso una stella, o trovare un altro pianeta e vedere chi ci vive. Se trovaste un modo per viaggiare verso l'alto e lontano dal vostro pianeta, finireste per raggiungere una soglia, un punto in cui l'aria e la gravità semplicemente si fermano. Questo è il confine tra il vostro pianeta e quello che viene chiamato {@b wildspace}.",
								"Lo spazio selvaggio è essenzialmente lo spazio esterno, il vuoto tra i corpi celesti che spesso viene chiamato il mare della notte. È soffuso di un'energia magica quasi impercettibile ma sempre presente, nota come {@b aether}.",
								"Facendo un paragone con un'avventura di Age of Sail, se un corpo celeste è un'isola, lo spazio selvaggio è il mare.  Così come il mare è composto da una grande quantità di acqua, lo spazio selvaggio è composto da una grande quantità di etere.  Tenete presente che il wildspace è il mare, non ancora l'oceano. Quando guardiamo lo spazio selvaggio intorno all'ambientazione dei Forgotten Realms, è come se stessimo guardando un arcipelago di isole.",

									"type": "entries",

									"entries": [
										"La prima sfida che dovete affrontare per lasciare il vostro pianeta è la gravità. Immaginate che la gravità sia come una potente marea, che vi riporta sempre indietro quando cercate di andarvene. Tuttavia, in Wildjammer la gravità si comporta in modo diverso da come ci si potrebbe aspettare. A differenza della vita reale, la gravità può essere attivata o disattivata e tira sempre come la normale gravità terrestre, a meno che la magia non intervenga per amplificarla o ostacolarla. In altre parole, la gravità non diventa più forte o più debole in base alla sua fonte, ma si estende semplicemente più lontano dalla fonte. Qualsiasi oggetto di dimensioni pari o superiori a 6 metri ha un campo gravitazionale.",
										"Potreste chiedervi perché questo non si presenta mai nella vostra ambientazione di D&D preferita. La risposta è che quando due fonti di gravità sono a stretto contatto, il campo più grande ha la meglio su quello più piccolo. Poiché tutto ciò che si trova su un pianeta è più piccolo del pianeta stesso, la gravità del pianeta è l'unica in vigore (a meno che non si usi qualche forma di magia). Solo nello spazio selvaggio due campi gravitazionali possono sovrapporsi senza che uno disabiliti l'altro, e anche in questo caso solo se le sorgenti non si toccano.",
										"Un'altra caratteristica interessante della gravità è che tira sempre nella direzione più conveniente per la sorgente. Questo di solito si traduce in un'unica fonte di gravità che attira tutte le cose verso di sé. Per esempio, un pianeta tira verso il nucleo, mentre la gravità di un wildjammer tira verso il ponte principale della snip Allo stesso modo, un drago potrebbe sdraiarsi sul suo piano gravitazionale e nuotare nello spazio. Ma non può avvicinarsi al pianeta.",
										"Questo porta a una fisica interessante. Per prima cosa, immaginate una classica nave dell'Età della Vela. C'è il ponte principale, gli alberi, le vele e tutto il resto. Il campo gravitazionale corre lungo il ponte principale, tirandovi giù mentre siete in piedi su di esso. Se si scende sotto il ponte principale, si finisce per oscillare oltre il piano gravitazionale e ci si ritrova sul lato inferiore del ponte principale! Si è a testa in giù rispetto a chi si trova sul ponte principale. Fortunatamente, la maggior parte delle navi che vanno nello spazio sono progettate per far sì che il campo gravitazionale si concentri sul ponte più basso, quindi questo problema non si verifica sempre."

									"entries": [
										"Ora che avete capito la gravità, che dire dell'aria? Come si fa a respirare al di fuori dell'aria del proprio pianeta? In Wildjammer, tutte le creature e gli oggetti possono portare con sé una certa quantità d'aria nello spazio selvaggio, in base alle loro dimensioni. La dimensione di questa bolla d'aria è sempre uguale alla dimensione del campo gravitazionale, se la creatura o l'oggetto ne ha uno. Tutti gli oggetti possono trasportare aria nello spazio vuoto, ma solo quelli più grandi hanno la gravità.",
										"Ciò significa che non appena troverete un modo per uscire dal campo gravitazionale del vostro pianeta, lascerete anche il suo involucro d'aria e prenderete solo la quantità d'aria consentita dalle vostre dimensioni. Questo significa che vi servirà qualcosa di grande, come una wildjammer. Queste navi sono abbastanza grandi da portare con sé una consistente bolla d'aria ovunque vadano. Allo stesso modo, le creature massicce come i draghi che volano nello spazio portano con sé una propria bolla d'aria che a volte può essere sufficiente a sostenerle per lunghi viaggi.",
										"Attenzione però, si può finire per esaurire l'aria!  Tutti i wildjamer possono trasportare una quantità di aria in base alle loro dimensioni. Più creature a bordo respirano l'aria, meno tempo ci vuole per consumarla tutta. Una volta esaurita, l'aria si incrosta, dando a tutte le creature che la respirano uno svantaggio su tutte le prove. L'aria viziata dura quanto l'aria fresca. Se l'aria viziata viene consumata, diventa letale e tutte le creature a bordo guadagnano un punto di esaurimento per ogni minuto in cui respirano l'aria letale.",
										"Fortunatamente, non è troppo difficile ottenere aria nuova! Ogni volta che due involucri d'aria entrano in contatto, l'aria si distribuisce uniformemente tra i due involucri. Ad esempio, se due involucri d'aria di uguali dimensioni si sovrappongono, e uno di essi è letale e l'altro è completamente fresco, entrambi dividono la differenza e diventano nocivi. Questo non è il modo migliore per ottenere aria nuova.",
										"Il modo migliore e più comune per ottenere nuova aria è quello di navigare con la wildjammer abbastanza vicino all'atmosfera di un pianeta, in modo che l'involucro d'aria della nave si sovrapponga a quello del pianeta. Dato che il pianeta ha molta più aria della nave, la bolla d'aria della nave si riempie completamente. È anche possibile ripristinare un po' d'aria in un involucro d'aria trovando sacche d'aria intorno agli asteroidi. L'aria nei campi di asteroidi è generalmente molto meno abbondante di quella presente nell'atmosfera di un pianeta.",

										"Ora sappiamo che per fuggire dal nostro pianeta dobbiamo trovare un modo per superare la gravità del pianeta e un modo per portare con noi molta aria. Un wildjammer trasporterà l'aria per noi, quindi abbiamo solo bisogno di un modo per fuggire dal campo gravitazionale del nostro pianeta. Fortunatamente, il wildjammer permette a chi lo pilota di vedere le correnti di etere, fiumi di energia blu luminescente che dallo spazio selvaggio scendono sul pianeta.",
										"Se un pianeta è un'isola, lo spazio selvaggio è il mare e l'etere è l'acqua che lo compone, le correnti dell'etere sono come grandi fiumi, baie e insenature.  Queste correnti rendono la navigazione da un'isola al mare molto più facile. Proprio come i diversi gruppi durante l'Età della Vela cercavano di controllare le città portuali, le baie e le vie fluviali, allo stesso modo le fazioni nello spazio selvaggio cercano di controllare questi punti di ingresso e uscita dai pianeti.",
										"Per estendere ulteriormente il paragone, proprio come i fiumi, le baie e le insenature naturali, possono verificarsi catastrofi che ne causano il prosciugamento e che non consentono più l'accesso ai jolly che vogliono salire o scendere dal pianeta. Questi scismi possono essere causati da catastrofi magiche o semplicemente da processi naturali che non sono ben compresi. In ogni caso, coloro che sono interessati a controllare queste rotte di navigazione verso i pianeti potrebbero trovarsi a lottare per mantenere il controllo dopo un tale spostamento!

								"Bene! Siamo fuggiti dal nostro pianeta (isola) e abbiamo navigato lungo l'etere (acqua) in tutto lo spazio selvaggio (il mare). In questo tempo, si incontrano altre creature, si incontrano pericoli nello spazio e ogni sorta di cose divertenti. Alla fine lo sguardo potrebbe volgersi verso una delle stelle. Cosa c'è oltre questo mare? Cosa c'è oltre lo spazio selvaggio? Dov'è l'oceano in questo paragone che ho fatto? Decidete di scoprirlo. Volgete il vostro martello selvaggio verso una stella che vedete e salpate dagli unici pianeti (isole) che avete conosciuto.  Ora le cose cominciano a farsi strane! Siete salpati, avete un equipaggio con voi, tutti ansiosi di vedere cosa c'è nella stella che avete scelto. Avete lo stesso ansioso ottimismo che Truman Burbank provava mentre navigava attraverso il mare che aveva intrappolato in The Truman Show (1998). Proprio come Truman, avrete una grande sorpresa quando il bompresso del vostro jolly si schianterà contro un muro.",
								"Vi avvicinate alla prua della nave e allungate la mano. La mano si posa su una parete. Quel nero che avete visto tanto tempo fa, quando eravate sul vostro pianeta, è una parete, un guscio che circonda lo spazio selvaggio su ogni lato. Quello che state toccando si chiama sfera di cristallo.",
								"Le sfere di cristallo sono costruzioni supermassicce così grandi da poter contenere al loro interno un intero sistema solare (o più). L'idea delle sfere di cristallo si basa sulla teoria delle sfere celesti presentata da Platone, Aristotele, Tolomeo, Eudosso e Copernico.  Secondo questa teoria, il nostro sistema solare è circondato da un guscio al cui interno sono fissate le stelle.",
								"In Wildjammer, queste sfere di cristallo sono reali. Queste sfere segnano il confine di un'ambientazione della campagna.  Quando si attraversa una sfera di cristallo, si lascia ufficialmente l'ambientazione e le sue regole.",
								"Anche gli dei sono limitati all'interno delle sfere di cristallo: Questo fa sì che, a prescindere da quanto potenti siano gli dei, quanto selvaggia sia la storia, quanto unica sia la storia, non influisca su nessun'altra ambientazione. Volete un'ambientazione con poca magia? Forse un'ambientazione fantascientifica? Forse un'ambientazione in cui le persone vengono lentamente fatte impazzire a causa di un orrore eldritico che vive nel sole? Forse volete una sfera che abbia solo un gruppo di tartarughe spaziali con mondi sulla schiena. Tutto questo è possibile semplicemente avvolgendolo in una sfera.",
								"Fortunatamente passare attraverso una sfera di cristallo non è troppo difficile. I portali naturali appaiono e scompaiono in modo apparentemente casuale lungo la sfera di cristallo. Questi portali possono essere individuati con incantesimi di divinazione di basso livello per l'equipaggio iniziale di wildjammer, oppure possono essere creati con un equipaggiamento avanzato da wildjammer o con incantesimi di alto livello.",

								"Ora continuiamo la nostra avventura. Ripariamo i danni causati allo scafo dallo schianto inaspettato contro la parete della sfera di cristallo e poi troviamo un modo per raggiungere uno dei portali sulla sua superficie. Proprio come un veliero che parte da un arcipelago per salpare attraverso il vasto oceano, superando la soglia della sfera di cristallo ci si ritrova nel vasto oceano arcobaleno noto come flogisto.",
								"Il flogisto, talvolta chiamato flusso o oceano arcobaleno, è una vasta distesa di colori arcobaleno che riempie lo spazio tra le sfere di cristallo. È difficile descrivere la sostanza effettiva del flogisto, poiché fluisce nella bolla d'aria di una nave senza sostituire l'aria stessa. Non blocca la vista se non per le cose a distanza, come la nebbia. È come trovarsi in un quadro espressionista dai colori dell'arcobaleno.",
								"Prendetevi un momento per immaginare un acquario. In questo acquario abbiamo una quantità infinita di spazio ed è pieno di questa sostanza arcobaleno. Al suo interno galleggiano queste grandi sfere di vetro, all'interno delle quali si trovano lo spazio selvaggio, i corpi celesti e tutte le civiltà che conosciamo dalle nostre avventure in D&D. Questo è il piano materiale. Questo è il piano materiale. Vedete?  Ve l'avevo detto che le cose si fanno selvagge nello spazio!",
								"Detto questo, il flogisto ha alcune strane proprietà.  La prima e più importante è che è altamente infiammabile e agisce come un accelerante. Se siete abbastanza coraggiosi o sciocchi da accendere una fiamma, la troverete invariabilmente esplodere nel momento stesso in cui viene accesa, danneggiando probabilmente voi e la vostra nave. Nel corso degli anni ci sono stati molti tentativi di armare il flogisto, ma purtroppo si dissipa poco dopo aver superato la soglia di una sfera di cristallo. Nessuno sa con certezza perché questo accada, ma probabilmente è meglio così. Se il flogisto dovesse mai fluire in una sfera di cristallo, troverebbe la strada verso i pianeti di fuoco e il sole, provocando l'accensione del flogisto e facendo esplodere l'intera sfera!",
								"Forse ancora più stranamente, il flogisto sembra mettere a terra la magia dimensionale o planare. Tutti i tentativi di raggiungere i piani interni o esterni dal flusso falliscono completamente. Questo perché non ci sono piani quando si è nel flogisto!",
								"Il modo migliore per pensare al flogisto è come un isolante tra le ambientazioni. Per quanto potente possa essere un dio nei Forgotten Realms, quel dio non ha alcun potere in Ravnica finché il DM non decide che ha dei poteri e può agire come un dio in quell'ambientazione. Non importa ciò che gli scrittori di Greyhawk fanno con i piani, non contamina ciò che Eberron fa con i suoi piani. Il flogisto isola dalla contaminazione dell'ambientazione, dando al DM la libertà di usare il cosmo che preferisce, o di mischiarlo per ogni ambientazione.",
								"Per quanto riguarda il paragone con l'Età della Vela, il flogisto è come l'oceano aperto. È uno spazio vasto e vuoto che esiste tra arcipelaghi e continenti.  Per la maggior parte del tempo, tutto ciò che si vede è l'orizzonte fino a quando non si raggiunge una nuova terra, come ad esempio la scoperta di una nuova sfera di cristallo.  Così come i marinai trovavano le rotte attraverso l'oceano in base alle correnti del vento e dell'acqua, anche nel flogisto ci sono correnti di flusso che aiutano i marinai a navigare.",
								"Anche se i combattimenti possono avvenire nel flogisto, non sono frequenti. L'oceano aperto è vasto e la possibilità di imbattersi in un'altra nave è minima rispetto a quella di imbattersi in un arcipelago più fitto. Anche se si incontra un'altra nave, è raro che questa voglia ingaggiare un combattimento a causa dei limiti della polvere da sparo. Tuttavia, ci sono marinai che raccontano storie di grandi demoni del flusso che raccolgono i marinai incauti che cadono in mare. Per molti è sufficiente rimanere vigili nell'oceano arcobaleno."

								"Ora che abbiamo discusso di come sia possibile portare la propria nave attraverso il piano materiale, dal proprio pianeta natale a un'ambientazione di campagna completamente diversa, che dire dei piani? La maggior parte delle ambientazioni di D&D ha un qualche concetto dei piani precedenti, che si tratti della Grande Ruota di Planescape, dell'Albero del Mondo di Forgotten Realms o persino della Cosmologia di Eberron. I diversi modelli possono a volte includere piani simili o identici, oppure possono averne di completamente nuovi. Questo pone una sfida interessante a Wildjammer, dove i nostri avventurieri possono viaggiare da un'ambientazione all'altra, ma non insuperabile.",
								"Tutti i piani risiedono all'interno di un enorme spazio simile a un oceano chiamato Mare Astrale, e un wildjammer adeguatamente equipaggiato può raggiungerlo e navigare tra i piani stessi, proprio come farebbe tra i mondi. Ciò è possibile grazie a un costoso aggiornamento di un wildjammer che incide sullo scafo potenti rune arcane che permettono a un incantatore che lancia {@i plane shift} di deformare la propria nave e tutti i suoi passeggeri nel Mare Astrale vicino al piano che si vuole raggiungere. Da lì può semplicemente navigare attraverso la soglia del piano per apparirvi.",
								"Detto questo, navigare nel Mare Astrale può essere pericoloso.  Mostruosità enormi come la Dreadnought astrale nuotano in cerca di prede. I domini degli dei inviano flotte per combattere gli uni contro gli altri o per proteggere i confini del loro piano dagli attacchi. La stessa Guerra del Sangue si estende fino al Mare Astrale, con gli Helljammers di Baator che lavorano regolarmente per frenare l'espansione della Flotta del Flagello dell'Abisso. Viaggiare attraverso il Mare Astrale non è qualcosa da prendere alla leggera!",
								"Se vi piace questo tipo di contenuti e ne volete altri, date un'occhiata a The Planes Above di Rob Heinsoo, pubblicato nel 2010 da Wizards of the Coast. Si tratta di un libro per D&D 4e dedicato alla navigazione nel Mare Astrale!",

										"In Wildjammer, i piani possono essere meglio compresi attraverso il modello dei Piani Infiniti. Ogni piano che il DM può immaginare esiste da qualche parte nel Mare Astrale. Questi piani sono completamente indipendenti l'uno dall'altro e dal piano materiale, finché non sono legati dal pensiero, dalle credenze e dalla fede degli abitanti di una sfera di cristallo. Ciò significa che la popolazione di ogni sfera crea un legame metafisico tra la propria sfera e un sottoinsieme dei piani infiniti. Questo, a sua volta, modella il modo in cui gli studiosi di quella sfera vedono il cosmo planare.",
										"Per esempio, supponiamo che un equipaggio di Faerun, che ha una connessione con la Grande Ruota, si rechi a Ravnica, dove non c'è il Monte Celestia. Anche se queste persone conoscono il Monte Celestia, un incantesimo di spostamento di piano non potrebbe portarle lì perché il Monte Celestia non è collegato a quella sfera. D'altra parte, alcuni piani hanno connessioni in più sfere, come il Monte Celestia che è riconosciuto in entrambe le ambientazioni della campagna Greyhawk e Forgotten Realms.  Si può effettuare il plane shift da una delle due sfere cristalline allo stesso Monte Celestia e viceversa.",
										"Questo permette a una sfera di cristallo di essere indipendente o coinvolta in altre ambientazioni, anche a livello planare.

Forse, invece di avere armi da fuoco con caricamento a canna, le armi sono tutte con caricamento a culatta, come un fucile da caccia che si gira in avanti per caricare i proiettili.

Nella Wildjammer, i timoni assumono l'aspetto di grandi troni, che sono condotti per il potere magico. Quando un incantatore si siede su questi troni, può sintonizzarsi con il timone, permettendo alla sua magia di penetrare in esso e poi in tutta la nave stessa. Questo fa sì che i sensi del Timoniere si estendano alla nave e gli permettano di muoverla come se stesse muovendo il proprio corpo. Grazie a questo legame, un Timoniere è in grado di spingere la propria nave a velocità incredibili, che gli permettono di navigare attraverso le vaste distanze dello spazio selvaggio e del Flusso.",

C'è l'Orbus, un beholder indebolito e schiavizzato che viene usato da altri beholder per spingere le loro Navi Tiranno. I nani prediligono un elmo chiamato Elmo della Forgia, che se installato nel nucleo di una montagna può creare propulsione dall'energia delle loro creazioni, dando vita a montagne volanti.

Un wildjammer non può accelerare a velocità di disturbo mentre si trova nel campo gravitazionale di un altro oggetto in scala mega o di una creatura mega.",
												"Quando si muove a velocità di disturbo, il wildjammer si muove sempre in linea retta e sempre a una velocità di poco superiore a 4 milioni di miglia all'ora. Ciò significa che in un giorno di viaggio standard di 12 ore per un Timoniere, il Wildjammer può percorrere 50 milioni di miglia, ovvero poco più della metà della distanza tra la Terra e il Sole. Con due persone a turni alterni, la nave percorre 100 milioni di miglia al giorno, un po' più della distanza tra la Terra e il Sole.",

Se un wildjammer in viaggio si avvicina a una mega creatura, a un wildjammer, a un corpo celeste o a un altro oggetto di grandi dimensioni su scala mega, il wildjammer rallenta immediatamente a velocità tattica. Questa improvvisa perdita di velocità non è un danno per nessuno a bordo, ma significa che il wildjammer deve manovrare intorno all'ostacolo e spendere un altro minuto per caricare il timone e tornare alla velocità di disturbo."

La differenza principale è che il flogisto ha i cosiddetti fiumi di flusso. Questi fiumi di flusso aiutano a guidare i wildjammer da una sfera all'altra e li accelerano oltre la normale velocità di disturbo.

I jolly possono facilmente imitare queste velocità per mimetizzarsi, oppure possono usare {@i Hover Sailing} per andare più veloci. Quando naviga in hovering, un wildjammer può navigare o volare per un numero massimo di miglia orarie pari a cinque volte lo slot incantesimi più alto non utilizzato del Timoniere.

Nella sezione dedicata al combattimento, ho parlato di come gli incontri su mega scala cerchino di imitare il più possibile i combattimenti su scala terrestre.  Purtroppo, c'è una meccanica da aggiungere che non ha un equivalente su scala terrestre: la manovrabilità.",
												"In generale, la manovrabilità è il grado di rotazione del wildjammer durante il movimento. Nei combattimenti a terra, siamo abituati a poterci muovere in qualsiasi direzione fino alla nostra velocità. Quando controlliamo una nave in uno scontro su grande scala, siamo limitati nel grado di rotazione.",
												"Immaginate una nave che naviga sul mare. Se volesse invertire la rotta, potrebbe fare perno sul posto? Non proprio.  Potrebbero provare a fare delle manovre fantasiose, ma girare una grande nave richiede in genere un po' di tempo e un arco nella rotta di navigazione.",
												"Per risolvere questo problema meccanicamente, ogni wildjammer ha un punteggio di manovrabilità. Questo punteggio può essere di 360°, 180°, 135°, 90°, 45° e 0°. Quando un wildjammer si muove, può spostarsi fino alla sua velocità entro un cono di movimento pari a quel punteggio di manovrabilità.  Dopo essersi mosso, può ruotare fino a quel numero di gradi a sinistra o a destra rispetto alla direzione in cui si trova.",
												"Per il gioco su griglia, i wildjammer possono affrontare fino a 8 direzioni, corrispondenti alle quattro direzioni cardinali e alle quattro direzioni intercardinali: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W E NW. Ognuna di queste direzioni è di 45°. Ad esempio, se la velocità della nave è di 3.000 piedi (90°) ed è rivolta a nord, può spostarsi di 3.000 piedi in un cono di 90°, e poi può virare fino a 90° a sinistra o a destra, da nord a est o da nord a ovest.",
												"Per quelli di voi che giocano senza griglia o usano esagoni, usate quello che va bene al vostro tavolo! Basta adattare queste regole per tenerne conto. Il gioco con gli esagoni sarà probabilmente il più difficile, dato che questo sistema è stato progettato su griglie o senza griglie per adattarsi al normale combattimento della quinta edizione.",
												"Vale anche la pena di notare che mentre un jolly naviga a velocità jolly, l'equipaggio non deve lavorare attivamente le vele perché un jolly non può girare a quella velocità.

The ship combat system presented here is an adaptation of the ship combat system Mage Hand Press designed for their Dark Matter campaign setting. This system is not compatible with the ship combat system presented in the official D&D 5e books. The goal of this system is to make the ship feel more like a tool the party uses and gets better at as they level up, similar to getting better with a weapon or at casting spells.",

								"As you've read through this supplement, you've likely seen the word mega come up a lot. In Wildjammer, you can run combat in either ground scale or mega scale. Ground scale is the scale that you're likely already familiar with from playing D&D 5e. Mega scale is the scale in which ship combat takes place. If this book refers to something as mega, it means that something is only applicable to ship scale combat. For example, ships have mega hit points, also called hull points, and they deal mega damage. The purpose of this is to keep a clear line between which mechanics apply to which kind of combat. A bunch of undead landing on your ship and attacking the crew is a ground scale fight, while battling a massive space kraken or a rogue moon is a mega scale fight.",
								"As a general rule of thumb, something mega is 100 times what it normally would be. For example, ground scale has a 5-foot by 5-foot grid, while at mega scale, ship combat has a 500-foot by 500-foot grid. If you deal 1 damage to a creature, they lose 1 hit point, but if you deal 1 mega damage to a creature, they lose 100 hit points, which is equivalent to 1 mega hit point.",
								"As you might imagine, this means you could easily mop up Tiamat with her ~600 hit points by dealing just 6 mega hit points. For this reason, it is important to understand that this difference of scale is a convention for the division of mechanics, not for translating them between scales. Just as a wizard shouldn't be casting a ground scale fireball at an enemy ship, an enemy ship shouldn't be attacking a ground scale wizard. There are ways for the wizard to cast their spells in a mega scale fight, and if the enemy ship wants to attack the wizard, they can get in close and board the wizard's ship and handle it in ground combat.",
								"One thing that doesn't scale up between these scales is time. A single round of combat is 6 seconds in both. The purpose of this is to make it easier on the DM should player characters be in ground combat while others are on the ship fighting against something else.",

While it may seem intuitive that the cannons on a ship would be dexterity based ranged weapons, this leaves many martial characters at a disadvantage that doesn't feel particularly fun. For this reason, this system has a new kind of attack, a {@i Ship Weapon Attack}.",
										"When a character makes a ship weapon attack, they roll a d20 and add their proficiency plus either their Strength or Dexterity modifier (their choice) to the attack roll. Based on circumstances, the DM may call for this roll to be made at advantage or disadvantage. If the total of this attack meets or beats the AC of the target, the attack hits. On a hit, the character rolls the damage of the ship weapon, but they do not add their modifier to the damage roll.",
										"Some classes have features that modify their attacks. Both the Gunner and Fighter Helmsman role have a feature to allow these to work in ship combat subject to DM approval. Using a feature like {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} with a ship weapon is fairly self-explanatory, but a feature like a barbarian's Reckless Attack doesn't translate well to mega scale. It either has no drawback or it has a drawback that hampers the entire group (beyond what it normally would). Luckily, a barbarian could jump into a Spirit Warrior where Reckless Attack makes more sense.",
										"DMs, remember that players build their characters because they like to use the abilities of the character. Reckless Attack is problematic because the drawback effects the entire party. Something like Divine Smite has no such drawback. I encourage you to be open and adaptable to using class features at mega scale!"

								"Spelljammer was initially thought of as being AD&D in space (Sorry - Innnnn Sppaaaaace!), but soon became obvious as a way to tie the existing campaigns together. One of the challenges of all the campaigns existing in the same reality, was that there are small differences like gods, for example, some of which overflow into other campaigns and others which do not. And things like the constellations of Krynn moving around. Crystal spheres, enclosing each solar system in its own container, were the answer to that."

								"How is it that one god has so much power in one setting but not in another? In Wildjammer, the answer is rather simple: No matter how strong a god is in one sphere, that power doesn't translate to another sphere. No matter how hegemonic their power may be in their sphere, the sphere itself is a hard limit. Ifa god wishes to have power in another sphere, they need expand their religion and get followers in that sphere.",
								"A consequence of this is that classes like cleric or paladin that derive divine power from a deity end up beyond the reach of their god.",
								"Luckily, there are two divine spells included in this supplement that help account for this: {@spell Contact Home Power|wjmais} and {@spell Detect Powers|wjmais}. These spells allow the cleric or paladin to once again regain spell slots while they are away from home. Paladins that worship an ideal rather than a specific god will still want to use {@spell Detect Powers|wjmais}, as it links them up to the power of that ideal in the new crystal sphere.",
								"Warlocks are able to bypass this limitation because their patrons are generally lesser planar beings that don't have the same power as a god. Gods tend to only get concerned about the intervention of other gods.",
								"If a cleric or paladin were to spend the time to spread the faith of their god in another sphere, they would start regaining spell slots as normal. Though be warned, the gods of that sphere may take issue with a cleric or paladin coming along to proselytize the faith of an interloping deity.",
								"Some gods already occupy multiple spheres, giving their clerics and paladins more freedom. Think of how many different settings use Correlon and Lolth. Worship of these gods can be found in multiple settings, and so the clerics and paladins of those faiths have power in those settings. There are also a handful of popular faiths in Wildjammer that are present almost everywhere. These faiths are the Temple of Ptah, the Path and the Way, and the Celestians.",

										"Priests of Ptah are fanatics about converting people to their faith. They argue that since they don't need rituals to contact their god in other spheres, it shows that they have found the originator god from which all the spheres were forged Opponents rightly point out that the Temple of Ptah is old enough and has such wide reach that they have worship in most spheres. Their access to magic comes from them being widespread, not because Ptah has some special status.",
										"In their zealotry, the priests of Ptah will often conflate Ptah with whatever god is at the top of a pantheon they run into to try to show that Ptah is the supreme ruler of all pantheons.  This has gone so as far as to have the Priests of Ptah saying that Ao the Overgod of Realmspace is an aspect of Ptah. This stance often leads to others being hostile to them.",

										"Funny enough, there is great disagreement over which gods fill which roles at which time, resulting in this faith splintering into countless factions with their own interpretation. It doesn't appear to matter much, however. Paladins and clerics of the Path and the Way from one sphere are just as at home in another sphere, suggesting that they are all correct and connected in some divine way. As such, a cleric from Kara'tur in Realmspace that sees the Overgod Ao as the head of the celestial bureaucracy is still in good standing with the Path and the Way of Greyspace, where they believe that Boccob resides at the top of the celestial bureaucracy instead of Ao.",
										"Although this faith is split into many factions, the factions rarely war with one another in a violent fashion. They work with one another readily enough, even if they have different interpretations. This has allowed the Path and the Way to be a considerable power in the spheres.

Only those who subvert their faith or attack their people are enemies.",

										"In a groundling adventure in D&D 5e, we can make use of the CR system to have a general ballpark idea for how powerful a creature is. Unfortunately, that doesn't extend to ship combat. We can't just scale up a creature to mega scale and expect things to work out. As much as I've tried to make the ship combat mirror ground combat, it does differ, and it is important to take that into account when designing encounters.",
										"Think of a standard party. Each character has their own amount of hit points, AC, magic items, features, features, and so on. When going into a fight, creature balance accounts for the fact that there are multiple player character targets, each with their own stats. This doesn't translate to ship combat where the ship defines the entire party's HP, AC, number of weapons, movement speed, and more. {@b What your party can do is constrained by the ship they are in.}",

												"Lets dive into that a bit more. I think understanding how a ship constrains the party is important to cake ship scale encounters.",

												"Now lets put this party in a Dragonfly. This ship has 75 HP, 12 AC, and 1 light catapult. When one of the Gunners uses the light catapult, they have a +10 to hit and they deal 7 (3d4) mega bludgeoning damage per attack, plus 5 once per turn from the Gunner feature {@optfeature Precise Shot|wjmais}. Assuming our Gunner is a Fighter with {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} (2), that means this ship can deal an average of 26 (7 + 7 + 7 + 5) mega damage each turn if every attack hits. That's pretty good when going against a Dragonfly or other low tier ship!",
												"Lets put the same party in something bigger, a Hammership. Their ship has 250 HP, 16 AC, and 3 heavy catapults. The Gunners still have a +10 to hit, but now they deal 13 (3d8) mega bludgeoning damage per attack, plus 5 from the {@optfeature Precise Shot|wjmais} Gunner feature. Furthermore, all 3 Gunners can make attacks, as the ship has more hardpoints. Lets say all Gunners are Fighters with {@classFeature Extra Attack|Fighter||5} (2), that means they can do 44 a +13+13+5) each. That's a total of 132 damage if all attacks hit!",
												"See how different this is? The same party in separate ships is a big change. The point I want to convey here is that when you are balancing your encounters, you need to design the offensive potential of your enemies based on the defensive potential of your party's ship. Your party will get better, but a ship is like a piece of equipment. It doesn't level up with you, it doesn't get better just because the characters aboard it are better. The characters can use weapons better (higher attack bonuses and the like), but the ship isn't changing."

												"That said, you may reach a point where you want to throw an enemy ship at your party. After all, it is ship combat! I recommend you {@b design your enemy ships exactly like monsters.} In a normal D&D 5e game, we don't normally assign class levels to enemy creatures, we simply give them enough HP and AC to last, with enough attacks to hurt and create tension, and enough features to make the fight fun. Build your enemy ships in exactly the same way. Don't get bogged down on the exact stats of every bridge crew officer (except for use in a boarding fight). I never reference the creatures aboard the ship when running an enemy ship, I just build the ship's stat block to include whatever features I want it to have.",

I don't own Dungeons & Dragons and I don't own the rights to Wildjammer. Much of what is in this supplement comes from information that can be googled or original ideas by myself or others. In this section, I'll be attempting to give thanks to everyone that helped along the way.",
						"First off, big thanks to Jeff Grubb and the other writers and designers on the Wildjammer team back at TSR who helped bring this setting to life. Although Wizards of the Coast hasn't published much of Wildjammer since the original run, the fact that it holds an esteemed position in the community speaks volumes to how creative and great a setting it is.",
						"Second, huge thanks for the Mage Hand Press team. After spending months trying to find a way to make ship combat feel fun, it was your combat system in Dark Matter that inspired me the most to get this project going and carry on with it so long. I'm looking forward to getting my backer kit, and I recommend everyone else who reads this far to go check out their stuff, {@link here|https://store.magehandpress.com/}.",

If the other crew continue fighting, the giff of the winning side rescue the giff of the losing side. Woe be to the captain that tries to stop them."

The goal in creating the Threshership was to build an affordable and formidable combat ship for new privateers, who so often found themselves retrofitting commercial ships for combat purposes.",

This has lead to many using the Threshership as a Fire Projector platform, moving in close, hitting hard, and covering ships in waves of fire.",
