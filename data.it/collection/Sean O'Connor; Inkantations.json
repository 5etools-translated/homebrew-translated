						"This book covers both mundane tattoos and body art, as well as magically infused tattoos\u2013some merely decorative, others imbuing the bearer with special abilities the equal of many magical items. From a butterfly tattoo that flutters its wings, to tattoo gills that allow one to breathe underwater, magical tattoos come in many different varieties. In addition to tattoos, other forms of body art can be found in various cultures, from ritual or decorative scarification, to branding, to getting variety of body parts pierced. Not every craftsman who offers one of these will offer all three, and certain forms of body art will be rare no matter where one travels. Tattoos vary widely by culture, by subculture, by race, and by class or occupation. Tattoos can often tell the canny observer quite a bit about the decorated individual, whether it reveals membership in a secret society, indicates having been a prisoner, or even a past bound in slavery. By the same token, different cultures have different associations with tattooing. For example, in some cultures, having a tattoo is the sign of being a criminal, and as such has a negative stigma attached. In another culture, a tattoo marking a rite of passage may be required before one is allowed to live independently or marry and start a family. Tattoos often serve as a symbol of brotherhood, with mercenaries often getting the emblem of their company tattooed on their skin. (Author's note: These are mainly intended to provide guidelines for NPCs and background for PCs)",

							"type": "section",
							"name": "TATTOOS BY RACE",
							"entries": [
								"Race is usually not a major factor in whether or not an individual is likely to admire or get tattoos. Those are much more a part of the subculture and social class an individual is a member of. What race does determine is much simpler: whether or not an individual can in fact get tattoos in the first place. In basic terms, any creature of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type, barring those with incorporeal or reptilian subtypes, are eligible for tattooing. Creatures with fast healing or regeneration powers are also ineligible for tattoos\u2013their bodies repair the miniscule damage from the needle too quickly to allow the tattoo to form. In addition, creatures with natural body armor have their natural armor bonus added to the tattoo artist's DC for the tattoo, and creatures with an Immunity to piericng cannot get tattoos unless special tools are used (see the {@item Gnomish Tattoo Machine|INK} in Chapter 1 and {@item Katavahndi's Stylus|INK} in Chapter 3).",
								"When you do consider the races, elves infrequently use tattoos as they prefer the unspoiled beauty of natural forms. However, their appreciation of beauty means that when they do adopt the art they usually master it with the same graceful and intricate design work seen in their architecture and clothing, using the tattoo to enhance the beauty of its wearer. Orcs usually use cruder materials under the care of less skilled craftsmen. Their tattoos are often rough, larger, in a few brash colors and have an almost smeared quality to them. Not surprisingly, these tattoos are easier to see at a distance and are more useful on a battlefield. Halflings rarely adopt tattooing in their native cultures, though some who live among humans develop a taste for it. Gnomes use tattoos even less than halflings do, with a few rare crafters' guilds adopting the use to show rank among colleagues. Of the so called ‘short races' dwarves are probably the only race to widely adopt tattoos, though it is far from universal. For example, dwarven miners or soldiers may get ink done after getting drunk (and dying their beards pink). Humans are the most creative and diverse of tattoo enthusiasts, though they are also so varied as to defy generalization.",
								"Beyond the common races, there are other factors to consider\u2013fur covered humanoids can get tattoos, but are unlikely to want to endure the arduous task of repeated shaving to get and display the inkwork. Beings such as centaurs and lamias can get tattoos on their humanoid parts without having to deal with such things. Fey such as pixies, dryads, and nymphs, are beings of constant change, and while they may use henna and body paints or magic to mimic tattoos for decorative purposes, they will rarely permanently mark themselves. Reptilian creatures such as kobolds, lizardmen, and troglodytes cannot get tattoo work done because of their scaled hide\u2013the ridged scales prohibit the smooth line work necessary for tattooing to be possible.",
								"Undead creatures cannot get tattoos, but they will keep any they had in life. With vampires in particular, the ink will often look much bolder due to the pallor of the flesh and will not fade with time. In the case of magical tattoos, they will remain functional for intelligent, self-aware undead only. Constructs may be sculpted with markings and engravings that look like tattoos, but they cannot get actual ink of any sort done. Shapeshifters who aren't otherwise prohibited may get tattoos, however unless their tattoos are enhanced with the shapechanging aspect (see Chapter 1), they are hopeless distorted in any form other than the one they were tattooed in.",
								"Of special note: elves and other species with large or pointed ears may get tattoos on their ears, but this is only common among some subcultures\u2013it is often a signal of slavery. Multiple piercings are much more common. Ear tattoos, if magical, occupy the head slot (or the optional Ear slot\u2013see Magical Body Jewelry in Chapter 3)."

							"entries": [
								"In general, wilderness cultures tend to feature extensive tattooing, especially to indicate strength, prowess, or the gift of magic. Tribal warriors will bear extensive tattoos as a testament to their pain tolerance, made all the more impressive when one considers the method used to create the tattoos\u2013tools such as sharpened bone needles and a small hammer are common. Nonwarriors may have tattoos to indicate passage into adulthood, marital status, as cosmetics, and in slaveowning cultures, to indicate who owns them. Clans within the tribe may also have their own markings to show their heritage. Shamans will usually have numerous tattoos to correspond to their experience and their level of power or prestige. In fact, almost all important occasions in some tribes are marked in such a way, leading to all members of the tribe except children being tattooed extensively.",
								"Wilderness cultures characteristically have rather abstract, stylized tattoos that are deeply reminiscent of the pictographs many tribes use to record tribal history and legends. Such tattoos may appear crude, but in truth tribal tattoos do not attempt for realistic representations. Instead, they attempt to capture the ‘spirit' of what they depict in an abstract manner. For example, a tattoo that, to the civilized eye, might look like a cluster of jagged lines with a serpentine track between them, may represent the mountain stream where the tribe successfully fought off a lethal invader. Lines and circles depicting natural cycles are also common motifs. Of particular note are tattoos mimicking tribal war paint\u2013warriors who are inked with permanent war paint are often berserkers, lethal in combat and troublesome in peace, who even members of the same tribe will give a wide berth. Such tattoos are both an honorific and a warning. Tribal tattoos are also a means of identification and unity. Outsiders wearing tattoos that look like tribal tattoos will instantly be viewed with suspicion and unless they can convince a tribal member they earned the tattoo in a fitting manner (successful Persuasion or Deception check with -5 circumstance penalty), are likely to be attacked and if they're lucky, only have the offending tattoo forcibly removed (see Tattoo Removal in Chapter 1).",
								"Nomadic and seafaring cultures often use tattoos as a means of self-decoration that doesn't take up precious space or add unnecessary weight during one's travels. Tattoos among such cultures are generally highly individual, as opposed to the community-based tattoos found among tribal peoples. The tattoos are less abstract in their representations and are usually easily deciphered. Sailors are likely to have images of ships, exotic natives, of battles against sea creatures, and of strange ports tattooed on themselves. Nomadic herders and traders tend to commemorate family, prized livestock, or whatever suits their fancy. Traders will collect tattoos from a variety of lands they travel through, while herders will usually avoid the needlework of other cultures, maintaining a sense of \"home\" no matter where they go. Both of these cultures frequently have scripted tattoos as well as representative tattoos, with sayings, names, or mottoes all being popular forms of ink among nomadic and seafaring peoples.",
								"Agrarian cultures are generally sparing of tattoos\u2013subsistence farmers can't afford the luxury of self-adornment that inking represents, and larger, wealthier farmers don't find much appeal in it. Priests of agricultural deities may occasionally be marked with the symbol of their gods, but otherwise there is little interest or call for tattooing among farming cultures. A major reason for this is because they stay in one place to develop the land and raise crops, thus reducing their exposure to other cultures and eliminating the need to carry a \"piece of home\" with oneself. In addition, because farming is labor intensive, it's impractical to have a farm worker unable to work for a few days over getting a tattoo done.",
								"It is among urban cultures where the art of tattoos becomes the most diverse and idiosyncratic. The density of population allows for a degree of anonymity, and the relative affluence of cities mean that tattoo artists can find enough customers to support their art. While tattoos in urban culture have less immediate meaning across the culture, they can be very meaningful to the individual and are often indicative of one's subculture. Trade cities are also likely to have a variety of artists, styles, and methods to choose from, while more isolated cities might only have one method, but it is developed to a very high degree."

							"entries": [
								"One's subculture is truly the determining factor for most tattoos. Gangs, mercenary companies, military units, clans, tribes, and guilds are all likely to have tattoos which serve as a badge of membership. Sailors in the same crew will often bear either the ensign or the name of the ship, witches in the same coven may have the same mark imbued on their skin. Essentially any group which places value and pride on membership is likely to have a tattoo common to its members. Adventurers who have been traveling together a long time and shared many escapades may memorialize this with tattoos as well."

								"In societies with very rigid social classes, or even hereditary castes, tattoos marking one's station may be found. Slaves in particular will be tattooed or branded as a method of marking them as chattel, and distinguishing which slaves belong to which owner. Peasants or indentured servants might bear similar marks to show who they serve or work for.",
								"Some communities take the opposite approach, with commoners and slaves bearing no tattoos or brands, and the higher-ranking members of society being decorated instead. Nobles and merchants may receive tattoos as they move up in rank on the local social ladder, or in politics or business. In areas with high rates of illiteracy, business-owners may find that a tattoo marking them as a butcher brings them more customers than hanging a sign above their door."

Even though the number of different individual tattoos that can possibly be inked is infinite, all tattoos fit into one of seven categories: textual, abstract, symbolic, enhanced (further divided into animated, luminous, shapechanging, and long-lasting), spell, wondrous, and punitive.",
						"{@b Textual Tattoos}: Words indelibly inked on one's flesh, be they words of wisdom, common maxims, or the names of those nearest and dearest to oneself. These are by far the simplest form of tattoo art and unless the tattoo artist is unfamiliar with the language the text is in, very difficult to make mistakes on. Such mistakes are often amusing to those fluent in the language. Textual tattoos are, unless otherwise requested, Small in size, often wrap around the arm or leg of the bearer, and are done with black ink. Basic DC 5 + size modifier, +5 for masterwork (calligraphy), +10 if the tattoo artist does not speak the language.",

Abstract tattoos are generally only done in black ink unless otherwise requested and are Medium in size unless otherwise specified. Basic DC 10 + size modifier, +5 for masterwork (more complicated patterns), +5 for multiple colors.",
						"{@b Symbolic Tattoos}: The most artistic of all tattoos, symbolic tattoos are images that look like what they represent. While not necessarily an exact reproduction, they are instantly recognizable as what they are supposed to be. Symbolic tattoos usually involve the basic palette, unless otherwise requested, and by default are Medium in size. Basic DC 15 + size modifier, +5 for masterwork (high quality image), +5 for advanced colors.",
						"{@b Enhanced Tattoos}: Animated, Luminous, Shapechanging, Long-lasting: Tattoos beyond the norm, enhanced tattoos are touched with magic to give them a variety of extraordinary effects. Animated tattoos add motion to their images: animals caper, dancers flow, trees rustle with the breeze, and so on. Luminous tattoos produce their own light, glowing in the color of their ink. The light is not bright\u2013a Medium luminous tattoo produces about as much illumination as a candle. However, it does make the tattoo readily visible and memorable. The light produces no heat and can be extinguished at will with a command word. Shapechanging tattoos do not move like animated tattoos, rather they shift between one form and another, normally. However, when on a creature with the shapechanger subtype, they will retain their form even as the bearer changes. Normally a tattoo would be hopelessly distorted by the shapeshift. Long-lasting tattoos are just as they sound, remaining vibrant for twice as long as usual. Regular tattoos, even with perfect care, need to be touched up due to fading, every 5 + 1d6 years. Long-lasting tattoos look fresh for 10 + 2d6 years. An abstract tattoo. A symbolic tattoo, representing a griffon.",
						"{@b Spell Tattoos}: Tattoos infused with a spell\u2013arcane or divine\u2013by the tattoo artist, allowing the bearer of the tattoo to access the spell a single time.",
						"{@b Wondrous Tattoos}: Wondrous tattoos are more powerful than spell tattoos, often mimicking the powers of a magic item.",
						"{@b Punitive Tattoos}: Punitive tattoos are a type of wondrous tattoo usually\u2013but not always\u2013applied to a person against their will. Similar to cursed magic items, in that they are detrimental to a character bearing one, punitive tattoos do not have a price or cost listed."

The character receiving the tattoo takes nonlethal damage equal to half the Craft DC of the tattoo, and can endure a number of hours of getting work done equal to their Constitution score.

Slaves caught attempting to escape or fomenting trouble may be branded by their owner. Soldiers who display cowardice or who desert their unit and are caught will often be branded with a \"D\" for deserter or \"C\" for coward on their face and or body. This is similar in principle to punitive tattoos. Branding does 1d4 fire damage. Applying a brand requires a Crafting (Tattoo/Body Artist Supplies [scarification]) check, DC 10 +5 for especially large or complex patterns, or for each part of a compound brand (i.e. successive irons being used in the pattern).

Either type of henna is used in the same way\u2013to create temporary tattoos of elaborate designs. The designs are often of cultural or religious significance, but are sometimes done simply to enhance the beauty of the one receiving the henna. Applying henna or silver henna requires a DC 10 Craft (henna) check, +5 for especially large or complex patterns.",

Body jewelry includes nose rings, labrets, tongue piercings (usually bar or stud shaped), eyebrow rings, navel rings, and even such exotica as nipple piercings and piercings of the private areas and arrangements like the \"corset piercing\". Sometimes piercings are connected by fine chains as well. In some cultures these decorations are worn only on special occasions, such as one's wedding day, with far plainer jewelry worn day to day. In other subcultures, body piercings may be openly displayed at all times, often as a symbol of rebellion or rejection of traditional looks. Performing a piercing requires a Craft (piercing) check, DC 5 +10 for more sensitive areas. The recipient takes 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. Failing the roll by more than 5 does the same amount of lethal damage, with 1 point of bleed for 1d3 rounds, or until healed.",

None of these are actual scarification, however. Scarification is the process of being intentionally scarred for decoration. Some cultures, especially among races that cannot be tattooed, use it instead of tattooing; others have religious significance associated with the act. Whatever the purpose, the process is generally the same. Sharp tools, not unlike leatherworking tools, are used to carve a pattern into living flesh, which is then either cauterized or otherwise treated to form clean scars. Performing scarification requires a Craft (scarification) check, DC 10 +5 for complex patterns. Scarification does 1d6 points of non-lethal damage and 1d3 lethal damage. Failing the roll by more than 5 does the total amount in lethal damage, with 1 point of Bleed damage for 1d6 rounds, or until healed.

						"Magical tattoos come in three varieties\u2013enhanced, spell, and wondrous. Enhanced tattoos are tattoos that have very minor magic placed on them permanently, allowing a tattoo of a bird to seem to flap its wings, or a dancing girl to spin and twirl. Enhanced tattoos have no other powers. Spell tattoos are tattoos that have been infused with the power of a spell. They usually do not look any different than a typical textual, symbolic, or abstract tattoo. In essence, spell tattoos are like scrolls, and like such magic items, they are one use only. After activating the magic, the tattoo remains but it no longer contains a spell. Typical spells infused in tattoos include those providing bonuses to ability scores, to armor class, to combat abilities, or those that provide healing, but any spell can made into a tattoo.",
						"Wondrous tattoos are more powerful than spell tattoos. Wondrous tattoos are permanent unless removed (see Tattoo Removal in Chapter 1), though they can be temporarily dispelled with dispel magic. Wondrous tattoos can be created that essentially mimic just about any known magic item, and in addition there are a number of unique wondrous tattoos, which are detailed on the following pages.",

The all-mask, when activated, changes the character's facial appearance to that of another face, real or imagined.

The all-mask does not change the bearer's voice or the height, weight or body type, altering only the face, eyes, ears, and hair. When used to impersonate an actual person, the tattooed character can make a DC 15 Wisdom Save, adding his ranks in Disguise to the save. For every point they beat the check by, the duration of the tattoo is increased by one hour, up to 24 hours maximum. This only applies when impersonating an actual person, not when changing features to a fictional person. If the duration is increased to 20 or more hours, it may not be activated again for a full 24 hours. The secrets of the all-mask have been stolen from House Arimaa so it is possible to get the tattoo elsewhere, however seeking the tattoo risks incurring the wrath of agents of the house.

								"These geometric tattoos traditionally cover a single finger of the right hand with such tight sigils and designs that from just a few feet away it looks sickened or diseased. The deep reddish purple ink often spills onto the rest of the hand, and onto the arm, in different swirls depending upon which type of tattoo it is. Originally created long ago by the Amaranthine order of wizards, the knowledge and ability to create the tattoo has since spread much more widely. A single finger sleeve doubles the number of spells an arcane caster can cast each day; with the spell level doubled the same as the sleeve level (similar to a ring of wizardry). Because of the nature of the tattoos, a wizard must have the lesser version before getting the next step tattooed (for instance, a wizard cannot simply have a sleeve III, she must also have a sleeve I and II). Thus, if a wizard wishes to receive a sleeve III tattoo, the costs (and benefits) of sleeves I and II are added to the cost of the sleeve III (130,000 gp total). As each sleeve is added, it takes up another tattoo slot, so a sleeve V takes up a ring slot, hand slot, wrist slot, shoulder slot and back slot, and the tattoo covers all five fingers, the hand, the entire arm, the top and back of the shoulder and upper back, and the lower back. The wizard with such a tattoo has the number of spells of 1st through 5th levels he can cast each day doubled. Since the decline of the Amaranthine Order in recent decades, no one has seen a wizard with a sleeve V, though there are rumors of powerful liches or vampire wizards with such tattoos.",

Most couples choose to have matching rings tattooed, but some choose half a heart with the other's initial, or the other's name or even portrait. Regardless of the imagery, bonds of love tattoos provide their bearers with a constant knowledge of the other's well-being, regardless of distance, so long as they are on the same plane of existence. In addition, once per day each tattoo bearer can protect their beloved with the effects of a shield other spell, again regardless of distance, so long as they are on the same plane. Bonds of love only work in pairs; there is no benefit to getting one without a lover to get the other tattoo, and no more than two people can benefit from the magic of the tattoos. In the event that one member of the pair dies, the surviving member will be fully and completely aware of their passing, then the magic of the tattoo will cease. Should one member of the pair cross to another plane of existence, the other will no longer be aware of their status, but will sense that the tattoo is still active. Couples who already had bonds of friendship tattoos can get bonds of love and benefit from both. ",

Cantrell Ovin was a wainwright in a tiny village who once repaired the wagon of the traveling inkantationist Rezol Ungmir. As payment, Rezol gave Cantrell the coin tattoo, but the only gold coin he had as a likeness was one from a far away empire. Rezol warned Cantrell to use the power of the tattoo sparingly and discretly. Unfortunately, Cantrell did not heed the warning and used the coins everywhere, in grand fashion. It didn't take long for the locals to notice that only Cantrell spent the foreign coins, which always disappeared within 24 hours. Less than a month after receiving the tattoo, Cantrell Ovin was hanged as a thief. His name stuck to the wondrous tattoo afterward as a warning for others to heed Rezol Ungmir's warning of discretion.",

								"A criminal's brand is a magical tattoo or brand that marks a criminal. The mark is in the form of a letter representing the crime\u2013\"R\" for rape, \"T\" for theft, \"M\" for murder, etc. In most societies, the criminal's brand is reserved for repeat offenders or for especially heinous crimes and usually takes the place of imprisonment. The effects of a criminal's brand are varied, depending on the crime. For minor crimes, such as theft under 1,000 gp, disturbing the peace, vandalism, etc., the effect is a -3 penalty to Charisma and a -5 penalty to a skill related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was theft, the penalty would apply to Sleight of Hand or Stealth). GMs should apply the skill penalty as they see fit, but to only a single skill. For major crimes, such as assault, murder, theft over 1,000 gp, or rape, the effect is a -5 penalty to Charisma and a -10 penalty to a skill or ability related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was rape, the penalty could apply to Intimidate or to attack). GMs should apply the penalty as they see fit, but to only one skill or ability. The criminal's brand can be set to fade after a certain length of time (the sentence for the crime, usually a few weeks to a couple of years) or to be permanent (usually the case for the most heinous of crimes). An unexpected benefit to criminals who bear the mark is that in some criminal circles, the Charisma penalty suffered by the tattoo bearer is not only negated, but a bonus equal to half the value of the penalty is actually received (round down). For instance, a thief who receives the criminal's brand for stealing a 750 gp gem might find that among some of his fellow thieves his -3 penalty to Charisma becomes a +1 bonus.

The effects double for every 50 feet beyond the limit they go. Under the effects of this curse, attributes can drop below zero and result in death. The magic of the tattoo is such that a superior officer can give the shamed tattoo bearer orders to leave the designated area for specific tasks, but if the deserter does not return by a pre-determined time the effects begin to kick in.

When Rynzoe then made a circle with his thumb and forefinger a magical lens shimmered within the hole created. With one hand (either left or right) the circle made a magnifying glass. With each hand making a circle and placing his thumbnails on the bridge of his nose he made reading glasses for seeing close up or corrective lenses for seeing far away. If he extended one hand in front of the other, pantomiming a telescope, an ethereal length of tube appeared between his hands creating a magical telescope. When he placed forefinger to forefinger and thumb to thumb a mirror glistened within the space. Rynzoe never again lost his glasses and the tattoo proved so popular, he repeated it for others. The tattoo is a fairly common one today, in demand by inkantationists themselves, as well as jewelers, crafters, rogues and spies. When using the tattoo as a magnifying glass, the tattoo bearer gains a +5 competence bonus to Perception checks when examining things up close, including looking for traps, hidden locks, or hidden doors and a +5 bonus to Craft checks.

Tattooing a spell takes 1 hour per spell level. The tattooed wizard with a specialization in a school of spells gains a +2 bonus to both rolls if the new spell is from his specialty school. Caudex tattoos do not occupy tattoo slots and can co-exist with magical and wondrous tattoos.",
								"A tattooed wizard must study their caudex each day to prepare their spells, which may involve using a hand mirror or other reflective surface to see spells tattooed on the back or shoulders. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his caudex, except for read magic, which all wizards can cast from memory. A tattooed wizard begins play with his caudex containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any, as per the wizard) plus 3 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to the caudex. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels he can cast, based on his new wizard level, for his caudex. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in another wizard's spellbook or caudex to his own caudex."

Each different feat may not be utilized in such a manner more than once per week. If the feat effect applied is from a feat not already known, the inked sorcerer must still meet all normal qualifications for it.",
								"{@b Bloodline Powers}: Your painted heritage has given you some unique abilities, many related to the art of ink and needles. You have extraordinary abilities with even regular tattoos, and even your magic has a touch of ink about it. Ray of Ink (Sp): Starting at 1st level, you can unleash a ray of magical ink as a ranged touch attack. If it hits its target (one creature), it leaves a visible mark in your choice of color which lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. While so marked, your allies receive a +5 bonus to Perception checks to notice, track, or follow the target, and a +1 bonus to melee attacks and +2 to ranged attacks against that target. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. Magic Inkwell (Sp): At 3rd level, you gain the ability to temporarily store a spell in a mundane tattoo, either on your own body or on someone else. Storing the spell uses up a daily spell slot until the spell is used (it will recover normally after rest once expended) but will stay stored until used or dispelled, via dispel magic or similar effects. Tattoos with stored spells will detect as magical in the presence of a detect magic or similar spell. Ink Transmogrification (Ex): Beginning at 9th level, the ink of your tattoos changes, becoming infused with various metals\u2013steel, mithral, adamantine, etc.\u2013and this change grants you a permanent +2 natural armor bonus. This change does not alter the appearance of your tattoos. At 13th and 17th levels, the natural armor bonus increases by another +1.",
								"{@i Living Ink (Sp)}: At 15th level, you can infuse life into your creature tattoos, summoning them to assist you for a short time. This ability functions as a summon monster VII spell, summoning the selected tattoo creature for 1 round/level. The tattoo disappears from your body while active; if the creature is destroyed in combat, you take 1d4 non-lethal damage and the tattoo does not reappear until you have rested for at least 8 hours. To summon a creature, you must have a tattoo of the creature on your body (for instance, you cannot use this ability to summon a dire bear if you do not have a dire bear tattoo somewhere on your body). This can be used once per day at 15th level and twice per day at 19th level.",
								"{@i Inked Master (20th)}: The ink on your skin becomes infused with your arcane power, and every magical tattoo has added potential. Whenever you activate a power from a wondrous tattoo that has a duration measured in rounds, you increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to half your sorcerer level. If the duration is measured in minutes or hours, you increase the duration by a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. Any tattoo with a limited number of uses per day can be used one extra time each day. Also, any damage delivered to a foe through the power of one of your tattoos adds a bonus to damage equal to your Charisma modifier. Finally, a number of tattoos equal to your Charisma modifier are treated as if they were created with the Compact Tattoo feat. This applies only to existing tattoos, not to tattoos received after you gain this bloodline power, and this does not affect any tattoo already created with the Compact Tattoo feat."

										"{@b Marks of the Past}: Painted ones blend their new art with their earlier training. At 2nd level and every other level thereafter, a painted one can select one special ability she could have obtained if she had remained in a different class and gained a level in it. In order to activate the ability in question, she must have a tattoo dedicated to her former class and the tattoo must be uncovered for the duration of the effect.",
										"For example, a 4th level rogue/2nd level painted one could increase her sneak attack to +3d6, choose a rogue talent, or advance her trap sense to +2. If sneak attack was chosen, the painted one would have to reveal her tattoo to activate the extra 1d6 of damage. If her tattoo was covered, removed, or suppressed, she could not use her extra dice of sneak attack damage.",

A series of three DC 25 Craft (Tattoo/Body Artist Supplies) checks are required by the artist to bind the weapon to the body art. The ritual requires three days, and one Craft check is made each day. By the end of the ritual, 500 gp of ink and supplies must be spent per +1 of the weapon's enhancement (consider the total bonus value of the weapon, so a +1 flaming shortsword counts as a +2 weapon, and thus requires 1,000 gp worth of ink and supplies). The weapon cannot weigh more than 10 pounds, nor can it be more than 6 feet long. The corresponding tattoo does not have to resemble the weapon, or any weapon, but if the tattoo does resemble the weapon, the painted one receives a +5 bonus to each of the Craft checks.",
										"Once the ritual is successfully completed, the weapon can be magically stored inside the tattoo and can be summoned with a command word as a move action. It will appear in the painted one's hand or, if her hands are full or bound, at her feet. The tattoo must be visible for the weapon to be called forth, and remain visible for the duration of the effect. The weapon will manifest for 1 minute per caster level, after which it disappears back into the tattoo. A painted one can call on her weapon twice per day at 5th level, 3 times per day at 7th level, and 4 times per day at 9th level.",
										"If the tattoo is somehow removed while the weapon is inside it, the weapon and the link to the weapon are lost forever. If the weapon is damaged while it is in use, its pieces may be returned to the ink, but they will not re-form or regenerate and it will appear as a broken weapon when called forth again. The weapon will have to be repaired (by mundane or magical methods) before it is useable again. A new weapon cannot be linked to a tattoo that has housed another weapon; a new piece of art will have to be applied to bind a new weapon, and the ritual costs will have to be paid again.",
										"{@b Sentient Tattoo (Su)}: At 10th level, a painted one can awaken intelligence in one of her existing tattoos, or do so for a newly applied piece. A ritual is performed to grant sentience to the design, which must reflect the personality and traits the painted one wants the tattoo to have. The tattoo must resemble an animal or creature that normally is not sentient, or an object, such as a weapon or item. A tattoo previously designated as a tattoo weapon by the painted one cannot also be a sentient tattoo. The tattoo has the same alignment as the painted one, can communicate telepathically with the painted one, and has blindsense 60 feet.",
										"A painted one can only have one sentient tattoo at a time, and the awakening is permanent unless spells like wish or miracle are invoked to permanently dispel it. Removing a limb with a sentient tattoo on it will temporarily keep it from functioning, but the tattoo will function once again if the limb is restored. If the painted one's alignment changes, the alignment of her sentient tattoo remains the same, despite any penalties that might bring.",
										"A sentient tattoo essentially functions in ways similar to a wizard's familiar or bonded object. The sentient tattoo can cast any one spell the painted one knows once per day, without using up a spell slot. This spell cannot be modified with metamagic feats. The sentient tattoo can cast the spell without direction from the painted one, including while the painted one is asleep or unconscious. In addition, the painted one receives the Alertness feat as a bonus feat, if the feat is not already possessed, though the sentient tattoo must be uncovered for the feat to apply. The sentient tattoo also gains other properties, depending on the type of tattoo:",
										"{@b Weapon tattoo}: manifests as the spell spiritual weapon once per day for a number of rounds equal to the painted one's caster level. The sentient tattoo can activate this power even if the painted one is unconscious or asleep.",
										"{@b Armor or shield tattoo}: manifests as a shield spell once per day for a number of rounds equal to the painted one's caster level. The sentient tattoo can activate this power even if the painted one is unconscious or asleep.",
										"{@b Animal tattoo}: the tattoo has normal (human-like) vision and low-light vision. If the painted one is blinded, the tattoo can function as his eyes. If the painted one does not already have low-light vision, he gains it.",
										"{@b Magical beast tattoo}: the tattoo has normal (human-like) vision and also darkvision 60 feet. If the painted one is blinded, the tattoo can function as his eyes. If the painted one does not already have darkvision, he gains it.",
										"(There are many other possible types of tattoos. GMs and players can feel free to expand this list to best suit the type of sentient tattoo the player desires, using the above examples as guidelines.)",
										"If a painted one dies and is not resurrected within 1 day per painted one level, a sentient tattoo will become inert. It is said that awakening the same design on another painted one's body in the presence of the dead painted one's body will transfer the awareness of the inert tattoo to the second painted one, but that, like many other things about painted ones, remains a mystery."

Years ago one member of the Fellowship accidentally donned a cursed robe that changed his alignment, and before he could be stopped had committed terrible atrocities. In the years following the disaster, many of the secrets of the order were learned by outsiders (including the process of tattooing the finger sleeves). Today, the order is secretive and almost distrusting of others.

When spotted, they will always secretly offer their fellow comrade a 15% discount on all purchases, and will usually alert them to the best items\u2013including magic items\u2013available.

The head of the order has the title of Malik. Beneath him are the Vizirs. Each Vizir commands at least ten companies of 100 men known as Rooks. The Rooks in a company are divided into squads of 10, each commanded by a Knight (meaning there are 110 members to each company\u201310 Knights and 100 Rooks). Brand new recruits in a company are often referred to as Pawns instead of Rooks until they have proven themselves on the battlefield.",

Knights receive 55 sp per week and 1% of the value of all spoils. Vizirs are paid 70 sp per week and 20% of the value of all spoils from all companies under their command.

												"{@b Malik Ivan Russo (LN male human fighter 15) is the current head of the order. He was voted in by his peers just over a year ago, and is the youngest to ever take the position. He is a fierce and respected leader, fearless yet wise in battle. He cares deeply about the Myrmidons and makes an effort to learn the name of every Pawn under his command. Though he has no magical abilities himself, he has collected a number of wondrous tattoos over the years, and those pieces of art combined with other mundane tattoos and the tattoos of the order leave him with little ink-free skin.",
												"{@b Vizir Sonja Allyn} (LE female half-elf fighter 8/ inked bloodline sorcerer 4) was passed over for the position of Malik when Ivan was selected, and is still bitter about it. She wishes to take the Myrmidons in a different direction, one she believes will bring them more spoils for less work. The knights and rooks under her command tend to agree with her leanings, and she is biding her time. Sonja has been with the Myrmidons long enough to know that no one person is in the seat of power very long, and she is patient enough to wait her turn.",
												"{@b Vizir Demit Chane} (NG male elf ranger 12) was also in consideration for the title of Malik last year, but unlike Sonja, was happy to see it go to Ivan. Demit likes his rank in the order, and has no desire to be in charge. He would much rather spend his time fighting orcs and \"monstrous men\", and training new members of the Myrmidons. Like the Malik, he is nearly covered in tattoos, including a tattoo of fierceness against orcs.",
												"{@b Knight Vaughn Blackforge} (LN male dwarf tattooed wizard 7) is an up-and-coming battle mage in the order, serving under the command of Vizir Demit Chane and fiercely loyal to Malik Ivan Russo. He is more than handy enough with a battleaxe, but prefers to sling spells in combat, and does so with great accuracy.",
												"{@b Rook Ashland Marr} (NG male human bard 4/ painted one 2) counts himself lucky to still be considered a member of the order. Not long after he had proven himself and attained the rank of Rook, his left leg was shattered in battle. Instead of falling in a heap on the ground, Ashland fashioned a makeshift splint out of his quarterstaff and limped after the company, continuing to sing songs of courage and inspiration. His bravery was recognized by letting him keep his rank and serve as the order's historian and record-keeper. He fears what will happen to him if Sonja ever attains the position of Malik, and is trying to warn Malik Ivan Russo of her dark plans."

										"The members of the Ryueken Order are legendary within their own nation but little known outside of it. The monastery of the Ryueken is high in the mountains in a realm traditionally considered lawless. The orc tribes and stranger beasts that crawl are said to have once terrorized the county side until the Old Man came. He came as a petitioner to the small monastery and became a student, quickly mastering his insane rages and putting his past behind him. Dedicating his life to the order he now walks among his own students, often disguised as one of them. Some say he has achieved the first step of enlightenment\u2013abandonment of fleshly entrapment\u2013and now seeks to abandon his own awareness of ego.",
										"Members come to the order either as children whose parents think they have special talents that will make life difficult for them but might benefit from being raised by the monks, or men who have retired from a military life to pursue spiritual and artistic pursuits. Those who seek to join live in the monastery for one year, working and training and if accepted, the Old Man, usually as a featureless young child, makes an announcement at morning prayers on their last day of training.",
										"The Order believes in inner purification through demanding physical training, meditation and encouraging artistic pursuits such as calligraphy and painting. At any time, a few masters continue the tradition of their tattoo arts with half a dozen or so apprentices. The Ryueken Order style of tattooing is one of the few that not only disapproves of using a tattoo machine but can not be done with it and must be done by hand.",
										"Ryueken are still oath-bound members of their empire and are sometimes called upon as diplomats, messengers or body guards by the imperial palace due to their inability to be bribed or threatened. Even a weak Ryueken combatant will not be intimidated to compliance though they may be scared for their lives.",
										"All who wish to join the Order must be lawful or willing to become lawful within a very short time as they learn self-discipline and order. If a petitioner fails to become lawful before their initial year of training is over, or if their alignment changes from lawful at the end of their training, they will not be accepted into the Order. Those who do become members must continue to maintain their lawful alignment; members whose alignment changes from lawful are expelled from the Order and forced to leave the monastery. Petitioners to the Order can come from any character class, though any levels gained after becoming a member must be in the monk class.",
										"The Ryueken tradition of tattooing is well known in their empire, and easily identifies them there. All petitioners accepted as members receive the Order tattoo\u2013a word symbol meaning \"true believer\", placed wherever on their body they wish. As they progress in rank over the years, they receive further tattoos to mark their progress. By tradition, all new tattoos received by a member of the Order must be done with traditional hand-held needles, not with machines or magical tattooing devices. As members learn self-discipline, they learn to channel away the pain of receiving a tattoo. For every 4 monk levels the member has increased vigor, or 1 temp hp which regenerates on each short or long rest. Because members of the Order are forbidden from owning much in the way of material goods (no more than 500 gp worth of gear and magic items), most cover their bodies with magical tattoos to help protect themselves, aid them in combat, and provide other bonuses. Outside of their own region, Ryueken Order members are sometimes mistaken for tattooed wizards, inked bloodline sorcerers, or painted ones. The Ryueken Order has no mark for former members\u2013members are free to come and go as they please, and are always considered welcome at the monastery. The order rarely asks a member to leave, but those who cannot maintain lawful tendencies do not fit in with the tenets of the order. Members who shift alignment or break other tenets of the order, are marked and forcibly removed from the monastery grounds. Ejected members are tattooed prominently on the forehead with a word symbol meaning \"unfaithful\" or \"sinner\".",
										"A member of the Order who spends time training with other members in a specific class feature can work to untrain and gain a DIFFERENT features for the same class/subclass.",
										"A character who spends a minimum of 6 hours per day training for 90 consecutive days can, at the GM's option, replace the feature for one which with they normally qualify. The character must find a mentor at the monastery who already has the feature they desire to learn. Any interruption in this schedule requires the character to begin a new training period. The GM may, at his discretion, provide for more advanced training opportunities (with the appropriate skill bonuses gained, if applicable), keeping in mind that more sophisticated techniques require longer training to complete. In this case, the bonus skill rank in a given skill may be taken more than once if the GM so rules. It is also possible to receive combat training at the monastery (perhaps just for a specific armor/weapon versus a whole category (ie longsword vs martial; plate vs Heavy). A character can spend a minimum of 6 hours per day for 8 consecutive workweeks training with a combat instructor and receive proficiency. Any interruption in the schedule requires the character to begin a new long training period.",

												"{@b The Old Man} (LN male human monk 15/inked bloodline sorcerer 5) is the current head of the Ryueken Order. He guides the order from the ancient temple that is the primary monastery of the order, though he is rarely seen\u2013at least, not that others realize. The Old Man spends most of his time in the guise of younger students, lesser teachers or even small children. In this way, he is able to wander among other order members and local villagers without drawing attention to himself.",
												"{@b Wind} (LG female human monk 10/tattooed wizard 3) is one of the master instructors at the monastery. She was criminal when she came to the order, seeking asylum from the local authorities. The Old Man took her in and watched her closely, guiding her as she renounced her criminal ways, became a devout and loyal order member, and worked her way up to her current position. She is often referred to as \"Wicked Wind\" behind her back because she can be a stern taskmistress.",
												"{@b Sedge} (LN male dwarf monk 8/cleric 4) teaches petitioners and students the use of various types of weaponry. Not only does Sedge teach them to use the weapons, but to clean them and maintain them, and how to manufacture and repair them as well. Sedge believes that a spiritual warrior and his weapons are extensions of one another, and that both must be strong and both must know the other for either to prevail.",
												"{@b Stara} (LG female halfling monk 4/inked bloodline sorcerer 4) teaches calligraphy, painting and tattooing at the monastery. She is, like many of her race, delightful, perky and happy-go-lucky, though she can be quite serious and even deadly if it is called for. Stara is also well-known for being the order member that pointed out that nowhere in the order's teachings\u2013before or since The Old Man\u2013does it state that members cannot enjoy physical relationships with one another.",
												"{@b Heffel} (LN male half-elf fighter 2) is a recent petitioner who arrived at the monastery after deserting from a mercenary group that was raping and pillaging nearby lands. Heffel grew sick of the gratuitous violence so he slipped away in the middle of the night. He now seeks to purge himself of the memories of and guilt over things he saw and did."

With specific command words, the ink in the hummingbird reservoir can be changed to any color desired. If the artist needs to pause in the application of the tattoo, another command word will cause the hummingbird to fly over to the tablet and remain there until commanded to resume inking. When the tattoo is done, the image on the glass tablet is cleared away by taping the glass with the stylus and speaking the command word. With this device, the artist may even tattoo themselves.",

Otherwise the device will continuously refill with nonmagical tattoo ink and will never run dry, allowing the artist to create unlimited mundane tattoos.",
				"If the hummingbird inker, the glass tablet or the brass stylus is broken or damaged, it must be replaced or repaired (at 1/3 the cost of the entire device) before any parts of the device can be used again."

If the duration is increased to 20 or more hours, it may not be activated again for a full 24 hours.

As each sleeve is added, it takes up another tattoo slot, so a sleeve V takes up a ring slot, hand slot, wrist slot, shoulder slot and back slot, and the tattoo covers all five fingers, the hand, the entire arm, the top and back of the shoulder and upper back, and the lower back. The wizard with such a tattoo has the number of spells of 1st through 5th levels he can cast each day doubled. Since the decline of the Amaranthine Order in recent decades, no one has seen a wizard with a sleeve V, though there are rumors of powerful liches or vampire wizards with such tattoos."

Unless the tattoo is somehow removed or nullified, the bearer can travel no further than 1,000 feet from the activator\u2013attempting to do so causes the bearer to be paralyzed in place, as per the spell {@spell hold person} [DC 15] (Save results in no effect, but each minute beyond the 1,000 will require a new save, until the activator mentally wills them to be free. Likewise, the activator can, at any time, activate the hold effect on the bearer of the tattoo. Also, if the bearer of the tattoos attempts to hide, the activator can always find them as if {@spell Locate Creature}.",
				"Highly prized slaves\u2013usually female\u2013are almost always the bearer of an arcane bonds tattoo, and as more than one unlucky slave has discovered, the death of the activator does not release the bearer of the tattoo from the magic that binds them. It is rumored that arcane bonds were first created by a drow inkantationist to manage a harem of captive surface-dwelling slaves.",
				"There are three ways to end the magic of arcane bonds. First, the inkantationist who created and applied the bonds can deactivate them. Second, if the bearer of the bonds can learn the original activation word, she can deactivate them herself (this proves very difficult, as activation words are kept heavily guarded secrets). Finally, any normal tattoo removal process performed in conjunction with a successful casting of {@spell dispel magic} and {@spell Remove Curse} can end the effects of the bonds."

The name of the tattoo comes not from the creator of the tattoo\u2013as most named wondrous tattoos do\u2013but rather from the name of the most unfortunate person to ever bear the tattoo. Cantrell Ovin was a wainwright in a tiny village who once repaired the wagon of the traveling inkantationist Rezol Ungmir. As payment, Rezol gave Cantrell the coin tattoo, but the only gold coin he had as a likeness was one from a far away empire. Rezol warned Cantrell to use the power of the tattoo sparingly and discretly. Unfortunately, Cantrell did not heed the warning and used the coins everywhere, in grand fashion. It didn't take long for the locals to notice that only Cantrell spent the foreign coins, which always disappeared within 24 hours. Less than a month after receiving the tattoo, Cantrell Ovin was hanged as a thief. His name stuck to the wondrous tattoo afterward as a warning for others to heed Rezol Ungmir's warning of discretion."

The effects of a criminal's brand are varied, depending on the crime. For minor crimes, such as theft under 1,000 gp, disturbing the peace, vandalism, etc., the effect is a -2 penalty to Charisma and disadvantage for checks to a skill related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was theft, the penalty would apply to Sleight of Hand and/or Stealth). GMs should apply the skill penalty as they see fit, but to only a single skill. For major crimes, such as assault, murder, theft over 1,000 gp, or rape, the effect is a -2 penalty to Charisma and a -10 penalty to a skill or ability related to the crime (for instance, if the crime was rape, the penalty could apply to Intimidate or to attack). GMs should apply the penalty as they see fit, but to only one skill or ability. The criminal's brand can be set to fade after a certain length of time (the sentence for the crime, usually a few weeks to a couple of years) or to be permanent (usually the case for the most heinous of crimes). An unexpected benefit to criminals who bear the mark is that in some criminal circles, the Charisma penalty suffered by the tattoo bearer is not only negated, but a bonus equal to half the value of the penalty is actually received (round down). For instance, a thief who receives the criminal's brand for stealing a 750 gp gem might find that among some of his fellow thieves his -3 penalty to Charisma becomes a +1 bonus. This is a GM's decision, however, for some members of the branded thief's guild (especially his superiors) might be irritated he was caught and punished."

A side effect of the activation is that the ink burns away as the magic activates, doing 1d4 fire damage, and leaving a non-magical brand-like mark in the same shape as the original tattoo. The ingredients for the ink of this tattoo were shared with several others, and soon it spread across the world. Though carefully guarded, there are several inkantationists and wizards who know how to craft a mark of recall. The design of the tattoo is usually symbolic of the location to which the bearer is to return (the original mark of recall was an image of Gregor's tower) but when secrecy is a must, an abstract image can be used. The tattoo must be in a location where it is easily reachable, so except for the most flexible of characters, the back is not recommended."

After misplacing them for the umpteenth time he decided to create a set of lenses he could never lose. He tattooed the outside edge of each of his hands from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the forefinger with a single solid dark line. When Rynzoe then made a circle with his thumb and forefinger a magical lens shimmered within the hole created. With one hand (either left or right) the circle made a magnifying glass. With each hand making a circle and placing his thumbnails on the bridge of his nose he made reading glasses for seeing close up or corrective lenses for seeing far away. If he extended one hand in front of the other, pantomiming a telescope, an ethereal length of tube appeared between his hands creating a magical telescope. When he placed forefinger to forefinger and thumb to thumb a mirror glistened within the space. Rynzoe never again lost his glasses and the tattoo proved so popular, he repeated it for others. The tattoo is a fairly common one today, in demand by inkantationists themselves, as well as jewelers, crafters, rogues and spies. When using the tattoo as a magnifying glass, the tattoo bearer gains a +5 competence bonus to Perception checks when examining things up close, including looking for traps, hidden locks, or hidden doors and a +5 bonus to Craft checks. When used as eyeglasses, the tattoo grants the bearer a +5 bonus to Perception checks to spot people and items not actively hidden or trying to hide. When used as a telescope, the tattoo bearer can see twice as far as normal (this does not affect darkvision or low-light vision). When used as a mirror, the tattoo acts as a standard mirror."

Rangers who receive a tattoo of fierceness designate the tattoo to work against their favored enemy (or one of their favored enemies if they have more than one). Anyone other than a ranger who receives this tattoo must also designate a specific \"chosen enemy\" for it to work against, using the same rules as for favored enemies.

In addition to the bonus to Intimidate checks, once per day the tattoo of fierceness may produce a fear effect (as the cause fear spell) in the chosen enemy (DC 10 + the tattoo bearer's Charisma bonus Wisdom Save to negate). The fear effect does not work against any creature type normally immune to fear. While the tattoo may draw the attention of other enemies, and possibly startle them, it has no intimidation or fear effects against any creatures other than the chosen enemy designated by the receipient of the tattoo."

So long as the tattoo bearer is within what would normally be considered line of sight, the tattoo of the unseen renders him unseen by the chosen enemy type so long as he remains still (a DC 14 Wisdom Save bypasses the effect, allowing the bearer of the tattoo to be seen). If the tattoo bearer moves, he receives advantage to their Stealth check vs. the chosen enemy only. If the chosen enemy makes a successful Perception check, they sense something, but still cannot see the tattoo bearer unless the Wisdom Save is successful. Once the enemy makes a successful Wisdom Save, he cannot be affected by the tattoo again for 24 hours. If the bearer of the tattoo makes any attacks against the chosen enemy, or against anyone within the chosen enemy's line of sight, the effect is instantly lost and the specific enemy cannot be affected again for 24 hours. Note the tattoo bearer is not actually invisible, as any creature other than the chosen enemy designated can still see him. On a similar note, if a friend or ally happens to be of the same type as a designated chosen enemy, they too can be affected by the power of the tattoo and have to make the required Wisdom Save and Perception check to see the tattoo bearer. A tattoo of the unseen and a tattoo of fierceness cannot be possessed by the same character unless each tattoo affects a different chosen enemy type."
