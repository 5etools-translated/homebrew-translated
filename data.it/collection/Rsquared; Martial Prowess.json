						"A common complaint about recent D&D is the gulf of power and utility that opens up between the warrior and the mage. While the wizard, cleric, and druid learn world-altering spells, the fighter swings his sword a few more times. Moreover, the metanalysis of weapon combat is largely solved, to the detriment of most of the weapon list. The tools in this document attempt to provide warriors with meaningful choices, options, and incentives to take actions other than 'I attack with the weapon I chose at level 1.'",
						"This is primarily a 'gamist' document, so while flavor is considered, it does not claim to fix combat to some imagined realistic or historical standard, or expand the weapon list for its own sake. This work attempts to adhere to 5E conventions: only as few modifiers and rolls as necessary to the mechanics. Each set of rules is presented ala carte, so a DM may wish to allow only some of these pages or powers; a checklist is provided separately for that purpose",
						{
							"type": "entries",
							"name": "Weapons and Techniques",
							"entries": [
								"The vanilla weapon list has duplication and weapons with no mechanical value. The revised weapons table attempts to make any weapon an interesting choice for a warrior, balanced by weapon damage dice, properties, and available weapon techniques. These weapon techniques improve weaker weapons, take advantage of circumstances, or impose effects rather than increasing the damage ceiling."

						{

							"name": "Combat Actions",
							"entries": [
								"Actions beyond basic {@action attack|PHB|attacks} and {@action grapple|PHB|grapples} are often locked behind feats, making builds inflexible and competing with ability score improvements. The Combat Actions section moots certain feats (such as {@feat Charger} and {@feat Grappler}) with situational actions, codifies DMG object damage guidelines for combat, and adds more ways for PCs to interact with their enemies and environment."

							"entries": [
								"An innovation in the 3E Tome of Battle, stances provide martial characters with passive bonuses during combat. Combat Stances replace 5E's Fighting Style feature with dynamic stances inspired by Unearthed Arcana and the Book of Nine Swords. Instead of one choice near character creation, a PC makes strategic and tactical choices during level-ups and rounds of combat."

							"name": "Maneuvers",
							"entries": [
								"The final section vastly expands maneuvers, with specializations - Cut-Throat, Mystic Knight, Savage, or Warlord - that represent approaches to battlefield superiority alongside a standard maneuver group. Like warlock invocations, some maneuvers have level requirements and are correspondingly more powerful. These rules also include optional features to gain limited access to these powers in exchange for their lesser class bonuses: a fighter, paladin or ranger can replace a stance, a rogue can sacrifice some sneak attack damage to add on-hit effects, and a barbarian can reduce his critical damage bonus. At higher levels, monks learn to perform maneuvers using martial arts and ki."
