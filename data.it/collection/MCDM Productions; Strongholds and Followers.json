The wearer of the Crown chooses which ability they want to raise, but raising Wisdom while wearing the Crown isn't the best use, as you're already basically immune to charm person and other mind-dominating spells. That is, unless you use Wisdom for spellcasting, in which case 24 Wisdom is going to rock your enemies for however long it lasts.",

But 24 is so high (+7!) that you can even raise your best ability and be even better at whatever you do. So it's a choice between surviving longer and doing your thing better.",

Like all the Court, the Princip prefers to smash evil over neutral monsters, but it tends to try to defend the character it Crowned, even over the character who summoned it. However, if it thinks the Crowned character is now so powerful it doesn't need help, it defaults to the character who summoned it (if they're different people). If neither its summoner or the Crowned needs help, the Princip defends the most vulnerable party member.",

								"In 1985 I was fifteen and a sophomore at Cypress High School, and I spent the year in my computer science class with Brad Thomas and Chris Steele talking about Elric and the Black Company and the Incarnations of Immortality. They were friends outside of school, part of a larger group, but I was still hanging out with the kids I grew up with in my apartment complex. I knew Chris and Brad played board games and roleplaying games, and I wanted in.",
								"At the end of the school year I signed their yearbooks: \"If you guys get together to play games, give me a call.\" They did. About thirty seconds later, they were my best friends. It changed my life.",
								"We spent that summer playing board games and RPGs and going to the mall, and the arcade, and hanging out at the pool. It's a time and place that has now been immortalized and paid homage to in popular fiction. When I want to connect with my mother's formative years, I watch {@i American Graffiti}, filmed one town over from where she grew up. Folks looking for that same experience for my generation's formative years watch {@i Stranger Things}. It was easy for an adult back then watching us sitting around Dave Miles' pool table rolling strange dice, listening to Rush, and pretending to be elves to imagine we were wasting our time. And not just adults, a lot of our peers felt the same way. But I never did. I knew something worthwhile and remarkable would come out of the hobby: a lifetime of creativity and memories and shared experiences doing something amazing with my friends whom I loved. You don't need YouTube or Kickstarter, it's reward enough just ending up at the end of your life being able to look back on the worlds you created and shared with your friends and the heroic adventures you undertook. The hobby isn't a means to an end, it is an end unto itself. And while the places and events and people and things we create and meet in our secondary worlds are not real, one thing is.",
								"Dreams are not real. Nothing that happens in a dream is real. With one exception. Chris Nolan wrote a whole movie about it.",
								"{@i Inception} takes place in dreams but it's about movies. It argues that while all these people and places and events are not real, something in film is. The emotions you feel watching a movie are real. That's what gives them meaning and value. When I watch Casablanca I fall in love with Ilsa every time. Generations of kids watched {@i The Adventures of Robin Hood} and ran outside play-swordfighting. Because the emotions you feel at the movies are real. Inception is using dreams to make a point about movies. And, I argue, RPGs.",

						"Once upon a time in the dim days of the hobby known as the 1970s, the game assumed you played until you were about 7th level and then built a stronghold. There were no rules for this, nor was any reason given for why the player or their character might want to do such a thing.",
						"For those original players, building a stronghold was a {@i self-evident good}. It was just neat, and they assumed it would be obvious why you would want to do such a thing. It meant your character was now interested in things besides killing orcs and acquiring gold. Treasure was a means to an end. As your character grew in power, they became more concerned with the state of the world. There were political conflicts and armies and incursions from other dimensions, and a single fighter with a sword, even a very nice sword with its own personality and special purpose, was not enough. You needed an army, or new spells, or extraplanar allies.",
						"The game transitioned from local problems to national problems, to global problems. Eventually, your 7th-level character fought a few wars or invented a spell or two, and then retired. Typically around 13th level. And that was it. The game had an end.",
						"This book seeks to recreate that style of play, but in a modern sense, by giving the players reasons to build strongholds. And we got a lotta reasons. 😃",
						"In this book you will find rules for four types of strongholds: {@book keeps|SaF|3} help you raise armies and improve your fighting ability, {@book temples|SaF|5} help you summon extraplanar allies to aid you in battle, {@book towers|SaF|4} let you research new spells, and {@book establishments|SaF|6} let you collect secrets and generate cash.",
						"Every stronghold also improves your signature class feature, powering up your Bardic Inspiration or your monk's Ki. Strongholds grant {@b improved class features} because they draw power from the land itself.",
						"The local area around your stronghold is called your {@b demesne} (deh-MAIN). Within your demesne, your character is now, if not ruler, certainly a very important person, so the power of the land manifests itself in unusual ways in your favor.",
						"Building a stronghold also inspires people, allowing you to {@b attract followers} by rolling on a chart specific to your class. These followers could be mercenary legions or artisan peasants, foreign ambassadors or fellow adventuring heroes!",
						"Large-scale actions taken by your new army, your stronghold, or your followers sometimes take {@b months or seasons}. Also, your new abilities eventually run out of juice, after which you must return to your demesne to refresh yourself. This is called an {@b extended rest}.",
						"To support these new options, the book comes with many new systems, including rules for {@book warfare|SaF|10}, in which units of soldiers clash; rules for {@b concordance}, which allows any character to plead with their deity for aid; rules for {@b creating new magic items}; and rules for taking your {@b retainers|SaF} with you into combat without having to run an entire second character.",

Or no \"types,\" just different abilities to buy a la carte. But I find these four get us 90% of what we need, with their variations getting us another 9%.

But even were we to pick a historical period as our baseline, there was no time in history that had bands of wizards and warlocks roaming the countryside pillaging dragon hordes and coming back to civilization with tens of thousands of gold pieces.",
										"Therefore any costs we derive must first be based in the economies of a fantasy RPG. And that means they must cost a lot, but not take too long.

										"It was short, at least, shorter than Dade. Lithe. Humanoid in form, but otherwise an insect with brilliant, multifaceted eyes. It bore twin rapiers at its hips and wore emerald green armor that reflected light with a liquid sheen, unlike any substance they'd seen before. It reminded them of a beetle's carapace.",
										"Its antennae curled and twitched, sensing arcane forces in the air. It seemed full of cocky confidence and daring.",
										"\"A mantis knight!\" Irdy exclaimed in delight. \"Oh I'd forgotten about them. Well done, old lady.\"",
										"Wenna, Dade, and Jeremy had drawn their weapons. Credan started saying a prayer under his breath. Only Meliora did nothing, except wonder. She was already way ahead of them.",
										"\"This isn't real, is it?\" She could tell by the way it manifested.",
										"\"Very good,\" Irdizavonax said with a slight bow. \"Well, real is, as Orvosortiax taught you, mostly a collection of habits, and by that standard...this creature is very real.\"",
										"The creature stopped before them and bowed, one hand flourishing before it, the opposite leg extended slightly out.",
										"It spoke. Its voice was gay, like birdsong on a spring morning. \"Corovaxinar remembers things that were, things that should have been, and things that might yet be. I am Lady Eweshtleth. I hold the honor of the Gate and the Door.\"",
										"The children stared in rapt attention. Only Irdizavonax was not in awe. \"They're from the Court of...well, now the Court of Arcadia, I suppose,\" he said. \"But once the Mantis Knights were the chief lieutenants of the elves. Still are, I imagine. Somewhere.\"",
										"\"So this a...a memory?\" Meliora asked.",
										"\"Good guess, but I don't think so. Well, maybe. Rather I suspect this is a real person who lived...or will live, displaced chronographically.\"",
										"\"What?\" Several of the children asked.",
										"\"Oh she's from the past, probably. Or the future.\" When none of them spoke, Irdy took it upon himself to impress them with the gravity of the situation. \"This is the power of the Eldest.\"",
										"Meliora looked at the little dragon. Someday...if they succeeded, a million million years from now, Irdy would be like that massive creature slumbering before them. She wondered, privately, if the little dragon would remember them then.",
										"\"Corovaxinar welcomes you,\" the alien insect-woman spoke in a smooth, assured voice. Quite unlike the absentminded old professor they'd gotten used to in Irdy.",
										"Everyone looked to Irdy, but Irdy nodded to Meliora.",
										"\"Oh. Ah. Okay, um...hello. Ah, welcome to...our world.\"",
										"\"A world under siege,\" the Mantis Knight said to Meliora. \"Corovaxinar needs your help.\"",
										"\"We need hers,\" Meliora said.",
										"\"A happy mutuality of purpose,\" the knight said, and bowed its head, smiling.",
										"\"Oh I like her,\" Irdy said, turning to Dade with a smile.",
										"\"Prepare yourselves,\" the knight said, drawing herself up.",
										"\"Um...um for what?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"The War rages. Corovaxinar's projections falter. But you are not projections.\"",
										"\"But we're just...\" Credan gestured from Wenna to Jeremy. \"Kids.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth raised an eyebrow and one antenna twitched. \"Are you now? I think not. You summoned me. You found the hidden fastness of the Eldest when none of your ilk could gain its sanctum.",
										"\"I do not wot of Men. There are none yet, in my time. Or have not been any for millennia. But I deem thee worthy, if any are.\"",
										"\"'If any are,'\" Jeremy echoed, looking at his older brother. Dade shook his head in disbelief.",
										"\"Besides,\" Lady Eweshtleth said, nodding at the axe on Dade's hip, \"you bear The Edge That Severs Souls. A weapon that would master lesser beings.\"",
										"\"The Soul Carver!\" Irdizavonax exclaimed, taking a step back from Dade. \"Ah yes! Many threads converge. Much that was hidden is now revealed. Hah! And to think I stood with you when you found it. Ahh, to be alive and young in such a time.\"",
										"\"We didn't...\" Dade said, his hand on the pommel of the axe. \"We don't know what that means.\"",
										"\"Yes well don't let that stop you, by all means. You've managed to do pretty well for yourselves knowing not much more than a bunch of farmers' sons and daughters. No reason to change tactics now.\"",
										"\"What...\" Meliora said, taking a step toward the Mantis Knight. \"Where will we be going?\"",
										"The knight cleared her throat, and a portal opened behind her. A swirling, cloudy thing. \"I am the Gate and the Door,\" she said.",
										"\"The door to where?\" Meliora challenged.",
										"\"The World Below,\" Lady Eweshtleth said. The children gasped. They suspected, they feared, but knowing it was another thing altogether.",
										"\"I don't think...\" Credan put a hand on the talisman to St. Gryffyn the Stout. \"I don't think St. Gryffyn can hear me there.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth cocked her head as though listening to a voice, which she was, and nodded. \"Corovaxinar will maintain the portal and act as a conduit. Your saint will hear your prayers.\"",
										"\"What will we find there?\" Meliora asked.",
										"Lady Eweshtleth straightened and assumed a dour persona. \"Horrors,\" she said.",
										"\"How can we face them?\" Wenna asked.",
										"\"As with all things,\" Lady Eweshtleth laughed, her dour demeanor gone. She placed a hand on one elven rapier. \"With song, spell, and steel.\"",
										"She stepped aside and gestured to the portal. Dade and Jeremy looked at each other and then started forward. The others followed.",
										"At the edge of the portal, they stopped and looked behind them. Irdizavonax hadn't moved. Looking very small now, he stood alone.",
										"\"Aren't you coming with us?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"Coming with you? Into that?\" The small topaz dragon nodded at the gate. \"I beg your pardon! Hardly. No, you've already got Corovaxinar on your side\u2014I would be useless. A trifle. Besides, what use is a young sage compared with five stalwart heroes!\" He was teasing them. But he really wasn't going.",
										"Meliora walked back to him. She'd grown and was now a little taller than the topaz wyrmling. \"But we need you,\" she said, her eyes watering.",
										"\"Ah, you like me, and for that am I flattered, lady. But you do not need me. Think back to all you've done. What hand did I play? A humble narrator, little more. It was your actions, your bravery that led you here. All I did was...explain things frankly that I don't think you needed to know.\" \"We'll miss you,\" Meliora said, her voice quiet.",
										"\"Well, I'm not going anywhere,\" Irdizavonax said, looking around the cave. \"I'll be safe as houses here. And I'll be waiting, when you come back.\"",
										"\"Come on,\" Dade said, not unkindly.",
										"Meliora nodded and turned. But Irdizavonax stopped her.",
										"\"Meliora,\" he said, and she turned back.",
										"\"To answer your question,\" Irdy said, walking forward. His voice in her mind was quiet. She knew only she could hear him now. \"I will always remember you,\" Irdizavonax, the topaz wyrmling, said, his wide milky eyes looking up at her in wonder.",
										"Meliora started to cry.",
										"Irdizavonax took a step back and turned his mindspeech back up.",
										"\"Goodbye, tiny humans!\" He waved to them as Meliora joined her friends, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her robe. \"And good luck.\"",
										"The children stepped through the portal. Lady Eweshtleth saluted Irdizavonax with her rapier, and followed.",
										"\"I'll miss you too,\" Irdizavonax thought, to no one in particular."

						"Large-scale battles have been part of the fantasy genre since Tolkien invented it in 1937 with The Hobbit and the Battle of Five Armies but, tellingly, that entire battle happens offscreen while Bilbo is knocked out.",
						"Like that battle, warfare in the game has always been something the GM was expected to handwave away. And that's fine for the core game\u2014it has enough to cover just managing skirmishes and everything else that can happen in an RPG. It's up to supplements like this to cover that material.",
						"Raising an army is a meaningful part of this book, and it plays heavily into the next book, {@footnote {@i Kingdoms & Warfare}|{@i Kingdoms & Warfare} by Matt Colville is currently unconverted for 5etools.}. Building a stronghold is only the beginning. The region around the stronghold becomes your demesne, and you might want to grow it beyond a single province and gain more power and influence. And in any event, as a GM I've always assumed the last step in acquiring a stronghold is {@i defending it in battle against those who would take it from you}.",
						"To this end, we present a system for resolving epic battles featuring hundreds or thousands of combatants on a side. Since that system gets an entire book after this one, we present only those bits you'll need to get the job done.",

								"One core assumption of this system is: 5th Edition players are already playing a very complex game and should not be expected to also play a whole other wargame.",
								"You may disagree with that. You might think that having a complete, robust, epic-scale miniatures wargame for 5th Edition would be keen. And I would agree with you! But you and I are not the only people to consider.",
								"Because every table I've played at had one or two players who loved wargames, one or two who didn't feel strongly about them one way or the other, and one or two who really didn't want to play a wargame of any sort. They showed up to play their character and had no interest in running an army.",
								"This system, therefore, is opt-in. You can award your players units, they can hire mercenary units, they can build a stronghold and attract units, and they may use them in battle. But a player who finds warfare distasteful can literally ignore it all, and while the other players are commanding an army, they'll just be playing their characters. While you can use this system all by itself to resolve a battle\u2014or use the rules in {@book Appendix: Simple Warfare|SaF|11} (page 241) for something even faster and more streamlined\u2014this system assumes a battle (clash of armies) takes place at the {@b same time} as an encounter (PCs fighting monsters and bad guys).

The armies clash outside the castle walls, or over the nearby hill, or along the road leading to the town, but we don't worry about where the units are standing, or how far away they are from each other, or which unit is next to which. We presume the armies know how to do their job and are doing their best to maintain position and carry out orders.",

But in my opinion, if that's the kind of game you want to run...you don't really need a system for warfare. If you're running a game where the outcome of an entire war depends on the actions of one character or a small group...you've got a whole fantasy RPG for that! That sounds like a great adventure!",

It takes place over four parts, and each part can be completed in one or two sessions of play, depending on your group's playstyle and how long you like to play in a single sitting. If all goes according to plan over the course of this adventure, the player characters will expose an usurping lord, fight orcs, acquire a stronghold, defend it from an invading army, win the admiration of a town filled with potential vassals, and make political connections within the Barony of Bedegar.",

								"One of our stretch goals was an adventure using these rules...and this is it! Some of you may be familiar with it if you've watched my original campaign diaries. They basically begin right before the action in this adventure. There are several ways to get a stronghold: a local noble awards one, you buy one, or\u2014perhaps the most common: you clear out a ruin and say, \"Let's make this our base!\" So we use this adventure to show off arguably the most complex iteration of these rules: The players clear out a castle infested with orcs, become embroiled in the local political landscape, and must decide how they're going to use their new stronghold. (Is it a castle with a keep, tower, and temple inside? Or just a huge keep? Not an insignificant question when an enemy army is bearing down on you!)",
								"I wrote the outline for this adventure and had already run it two or three times in my own games, but to minimize the impact on our production schedule, I asked James Haeck to write it. So what you're about to read is a combination of my outline and his ideas. He took Pinna from being a one-line description to one of my favorite NPCs! I can't wait to run her the next time I deploy this adventure. 😃",

Its map would show you a series of far-flung baronies connected by disused roads, surrounded by hazardous wilderness.
