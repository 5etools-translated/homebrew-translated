A creature that consumes the food or drink or who takes damage from that weapon must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. A creature that fails that saving throw must succeed on another Constitution saving throw after one minute has passed or become unconscious for 8 hours. When a creature uses its action to rouse the sleeping creature or the sleeping creature takes damage, the sleeping creature may make another Constitution saving throw, waking up on a success.",
				"{@b Smelling Salts}. A creature can take the Use an Object action to administer a dose of these salts to itself or another creature within 5 feet of it. When it does, the creature affected can choose to wake up or end one effect causing it to be charmed, frightened, or stunned.",
				"{@b Tangle Root Toxin}. You can apply a dose of this toxin to a weapon with the Use an Object action. The next time this weapon deals damage, the creature is inebriated for the next minute. While inebriated, it has disadvantage on Perception ability checks and the first time each turn it uses its movement, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the end of its turn.",
				"{@b Waking Nightmare Acid}. You can apply a dose of this acid to a weapon with the Use an Object action. The next time this weapon deals damage, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it is frightened and takes 1d6 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.",
