						"Mankind is hardwired for faith. Before the invention of pottery and agriculture, humans had already invented the gods some 25,000 years before. The first deities were aspects of nature: animals spirits, tree spirits, the sea and sky, and so on. All of nature was to be revered.",
						"Stories were handed down by word of mouth, and nature started to take on anthropomorphic form. A spider spirit morphed into a human god with spider legs. The trees and lakes became a goddess who could transform from human into water or water nymph.",
						"The original stories were lost to time, but as mankind developed written languages, the gods took the forms we now understand. For centuries cultures collided, borrowing from one another's stories so that gods like Ishtar, Isis, Mithra, and Aphrodite all started to look alike. North Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and India all flourished with tales of thousands of gods and goddesses. As people migrated and cultures came in contact with one another, Europe and Asia added their tales to the growing tapestry of world religions.",
						"With the advent of monotheism, these religions became mythologies, and a single creator began to replace the scores of pantheons dotting the globe. Missionaries brought word of a single god to every society, and many cultures lost their spiritual heritage.",
						"It would not be until the 18th century and the German advent of Religionsgeschichtliche that other faiths would be taken seriously as \"cultural phenomenon\" again. It is from this school of thought that so many stories were rescued and our modern snapshot of mythologies starts to take shape.",
						"But this book is not about Western, arm-chair philosophers trying to make sense of the ancient world from their ivory watchtowers. This book is about the celebration of faiths from all corners of the globe, reimagined in a gaming context.",
						"These gods and goddesses are our nineteen favorites from a host of pantheons, spanning thousands of years of written and oral histories. Time has been spent not only examining them in their historical context, but also keeping as much of their genuine histories alive while still making them playable in a fantasy campaign world.",
						"We've gone the extra mile of making them all part of the same cultural gestalt, putting African, meso-American, and even a Mongolian god right next to each other in a fantasy world. The dynamic environment here should be obvious. What happens when the followers of Shiva and Tengri meet each other, arguing over who invented the world?",
						"Fantasy gaming has introduced many gods from the Western World time and again. But we think the material here, written in this manner, reveals the most important element of faith: respect for heritage. Where a god or goddess comes from is just as important as the ideas that are spawned from their philosophies.",
						"We hope these introductions to some amazing gods inspire you to dig deeper into the faiths of the ancient (and, in some cases, modern) world. And at the very least, may they lead to some great stories.",

								"Options for a Game Master (GM) are a wonderful thing. This book can assist you in bringing in new elements to your current campaign setting. Add them to an existing setting, or create an entirely new world based around these gods and goddesses.",
								"There is enough information presented here to have adventures for years to come\u2014new cleric domains, paladin oaths, spells, special abilities, and much more.",
								"What motivates your clerics and paladins? What new abilities and spells will your players use? If you are a GM, have new encounters for your players with an upstart religious group. Perhaps all these new gods and goddesses have recently appeared in the last dozen years or slowly built a following over the centuries. The possibilities are virtually endless.",
								"Has there ever been a time when a character could encounter such a divine being? While it would never be recommended to have a conflict with a deity's avatar, the gods' stats and other mechanicals info are provided. These are super-powered entities with which players should take extreme caution, even at levels 20 and beyond. Some deities are so powerful that they can wipe out an army or city in moments. Proceed with extreme caution when encountering any avatar.",
								"Additionally, the gods and goddesses within have at their disposal many companions who will assist them when called upon. These companion encounters are more likely for mortals. However, make no mistake\u2014these are the most supreme powers in all of creation, and they will use all the tools at their disposal if their plans are disrupted. These deities can literally change the course of history overnight.",
								"The actions of the gods generally do not happen often at the cosmic level (thankfully), but more through the mortals who worship them. Conflicts like this are nothing new and have been around for eons. No one truly knows the motivations of the gods at any given time, but this is how characters can be conduits for their deities of choice and carry out their plans in your world.",
								"Fight for your god. Defend the name of your goddess. Dispatch all known enemies in the name of your chosen deity. Your characters have a higher purpose which will inevitably clash with others in the world. What better way to seek adventure and spread the word of your god or goddess? You now have many more options, so have fun on the journey."

She comes from a time when mankind was rough but wise and honored their elders, a time when the word \"witch\" meant \"wise\" and when grandmothers taught their tribes the art of giving birth. Baba Yaga is the first such woman who understood the mystery of birth and death. Baba Yaga (literally woman of stone) is as much an earth elemental as she is a goddess. Her wisdom endures now through nature, and her original form is still rumored to reside in a craggy mountainside in the cold northern lands.",

Koschei can shapeshift into a whirlwind, summoning thunder and lightning at will.",

She is the perennial witch and mother of winter. She is the birds, clouds, death, matriarch, mermaids (rusalka), moon, pelicans, and snakes. She is the watcher of wicked thoughts. Baba Yaga guards over what she considers her people. Unlike most gods, she has no temples nor proselytizers who spread the word of her faith. Rather, she is the shepherd of the weak, teaching them to grow strong and punishing those who grow arrogant or wicked.",
