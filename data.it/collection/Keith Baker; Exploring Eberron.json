						"Nel 2002 Wizards of the Coast annunciò il Fantasy Setting Search: un bando per la creazione di un nuovo mondo per Dungeons & Dragons. Ricevettero migliaia di proposte, tra cui il mio mondo, che alla fine sarebbe diventato Eberron. Ho lavorato con James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins e molti altri per sviluppare la mia idea originale in Eberron come lo conoscete oggi.",
						"Sono estremamente orgoglioso del mondo che abbiamo creato. Tuttavia, ci sono elementi che amo e che non ho mai avuto l'opportunità di esplorare in un libro ufficiale. Quando ho iniziato a progettare il mondo, ho incluso le nazioni acquatiche, considerando le civiltà che i merfolk, i sahuagin e altre specie sottomarine intelligenti avrebbero potuto costruire. Abbiamo sviluppato un sistema di piani unico per Eberron, dal sapore molto diverso rispetto alla consolidata Grande Ruota. Abbiamo presentato l'idea di un fiero impero di goblinoidi che governava il Khorvaire molto prima dell'arrivo dell'umanità. I piani esistono, ma non c'è mai stato abbastanza spazio per descriverli in più di un paragrafo ciascuno, il che non è sufficiente per capire cosa rende Fernia diversa dal Piano Elementale del Fuoco o come si potrebbe ambientare un'avventura a Mabar. Dal materiale canonico sappiamo che i sahuagin esistono e che hanno ambasciatori a Stormreach, ma non viene rivelato nulla sulle loro civiltà.",
						"Fin dall'inizio ho sperato che avremmo potuto vedere un {@i Planes of Eberron} sourcebook, ma non è mai stato realizzato e quando Eberron è tornato nella quarta e quinta edizione di D&D, i sourcebook dovevano dare priorità alle basi fondamentali dell'ambientazione e non avevano spazio per esplorare questi angoli nascosti. Quindi, anche se ho sempre sognato Droaam e i piani nella mia testa, Eberron è proprietà intellettuale di Wizards of the Coast e solo loro potevano pubblicare nuovo materiale di Eberron. Tutto questo è cambiato nel 2018, quando Wizards of the Coast ha collaborato con me per creare {@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}, un supplemento in PDF pubblicato sul sito web della Dungeon Masters Guild... e con questo rilascio ha reso possibile, per la prima volta nella storia di Eberron, a chiunque di creare nuovi contenuti per Eberron attraverso la Dungeon Masters Guild. L'anno successivo, con la creazione di {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} - la copertina rigida ufficiale della quinta edizione - il team di progettazione ampliò la storia dei nani di Mror. Ma ancora una volta non c'era abbastanza spazio per concentrarsi sul loro conflitto con i daelkyr e sul mistero del Regno di Sotto.",
						"È qui che è entrato in scena Wayne Chang, che lavora con me al podcast {@i Manifest Zone}. Insieme abbiamo abbozzato un progetto per un libro che approfondisce molti degli argomenti che ho sempre voluto esplorare: gli aerei, i Dhakaani e le nazioni sottomarine, oltre ad alcuni sviluppi più recenti, come il Mror. E così è nato questo libro!",
						"Come si è visto, scrivere un libro di queste dimensioni è una mole di lavoro {@i tremendous}. Laura Hirsbrunner ha svolto compiti erculei sia come editor che come impaginatore, mentre Will Brolley ha sviluppato mostri coinvolgenti, oggetti magici, archetipi e altro ancora. Poiché lavorare nel vuoto è un buon modo per morire di asfissia, sono incredibilmente grato a Laura, Wayne e Will per essere stati una fonte costante di feedback e ispirazione.",
						"Abbiamo anche collaborato con una serie di artisti per sviluppare opere originali per questo libro. Dal meraviglioso ritratto di Tira Miron di Katerina Poliakova, che apre il capitolo 3, all'incredibile mappa planare di Marco Bernardini con le sue viste in miniatura di ogni piano, è stato emozionante vedere questi aspetti inesplorati del mondo prendere vita. In alcuni casi, per trasmettere un concetto a un artista, ho messo al lavoro le mie limitate capacità artistiche. Qui sotto c'è la mia prima bozza di una città sahuagin costruita intorno a uno dei kar'lassa addormentati - e nel capitolo 4 potete vedere come Vincentius Matthew ha dato un senso al mio schizzo!",
						"Sarei negligente se non chiamassi in causa anche la comunità di giocatori, DM e creatori di Eberron che mantengono in vita Eberron, compresi i nostri eccellenti playtester! E, naturalmente, la mia brillante moglie, partner creativa e cofondatrice di Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis, che è sempre disposta a fare una conversazione sugli squali sotto copertura o sulle attrazioni turistiche del Piano della Pace.",
						"Prima di presentarvi questo libro, un'avvertenza: questa è una visione di Eberron come la gestisco io al mio tavolo. Troverete alcuni dettagli che non sono in linea con i precedenti libri di fonti; sta a voi decidere quali utilizzare. Ma ricordate che c'è sempre una terza opzione: usare la risposta {@i your}. Fin dall'inizio, ormai quasi due decenni fa - quando abbiamo scelto di non presentare la causa del Lutto o di non rivelare i poteri del Marchio della Morte - volevamo che Eberron {@i inspire} coinvolgesse i giocatori e i Dungeon Master, non che li limitasse. Questo è un libro di idee su cui potrete basarvi - e alcune potrete anche ignorarle. Questo presenta {@i my} Eberron, ma sono sempre entusiasta di vedere persone che fanno proprio questo mondo.",

L'epurazione dei licantropi all'inizio del IX secolo ha messo a dura prova le relazioni tra l'umanità e i mutaforma.

Secondo alcune testimonianze, Xoriat un tempo comprendeva tutto; alcuni culti del Drago di Sotto affermano che i daelkyr stanno semplicemente cercando di ripristinare l'equilibrio originario della realtà. Altri sostengono che non c'era nulla prima della creazione - che i Progenitori sono discesi da un livello superiore di realtà, lo stesso regno inconoscibile che si trova sopra e oltre Dolurrh. Ma quasi tutte le culture concordano sulle forze che hanno portato la realtà all'esistenza.",
										"Tre esseri hanno dato vita ai piani e poi hanno usato questi concetti per fondare il Piano Materiale. I giganti affermano che questi tre esseri erano una qualche forma di titano, ma l'interpretazione comune è quella dei Wyrm Progenitori: tre immensi draghi cosmici. In ogni caso, la storia si conclude con un conflitto. Dopo aver completato la creazione del Piano Materiale, Khyber colpì senza preavviso e fece a pezzi Siberys, lasciando i suoi resti alla deriva nell'Anello dorato di Siberys in tutto il mondo.",
										"Sapendo di non poter sconfiggere Khyber, Eberron si arrotolò intorno a lei, diventando il mondo stesso e legando Khyber in una prigione vivente che dura tuttora. Così, il mondo come lo conosciamo è formato dall'intersezione di Siberys, Eberron e Khyber: il Drago di Sopra, il Drago di Mezzo e il Drago di Sotto.",
										"Sebbene questa storia sia nota a tutti, alcune tradizioni le danno più peso di altre. Nelle Cinque Nazioni, la maggior parte la considera una semplice metafora del cielo, della terra e dei mostri che si nascondono al di sotto. Anche coloro che la considerano una verità letterale (come molti druidi) non venerano i Progenitori allo stesso modo dell'Ospite Sovrano. Siberys è morta ed Eberron è il mondo stesso; è la fonte di tutta la vita, ma non interviene attivamente in alcun modo. Tuttavia, alcuni culti (in particolare tra i kobold di Khorvaire) venerano direttamente i Progenitori.",
										"Che si tratti di verità letterale o di metafora, la battaglia di questi potenti Progenitori ebbe luogo in un lontano passato. Il suo impatto sul presente è soprattutto questo: che esiste {@i is} un presente. Poiché questo atto di creazione ha dato vita a tutte le cose, gli studiosi di Khorvaire non hanno ancora trovato alcuna reliquia o documentazione di questo tempo prima del tempo. Se una storia coinvolgesse un oggetto proveniente da un passato più profondo, probabilmente possiederebbe un grande potere e sarebbe di enorme interesse per gli studiosi."

I più grandi tra questi erano gli overlord, arcimaghi immortali che incarnano i mali che affliggono i mortali. Ogni Signore Supremo modellò il mondo in base ai propri capricci e nessuna civiltà poté sfidarli. Fu un'epoca di caos che durò per millenni.",

Ritenuti da alcuni draghi, da altri dei - o forse qualcosa di completamente diverso - questi ribelli sollevarono un esercito di draghi alleati con i couatl, celestiali nativi che si dice incarnino l'ultima luce di Siberys. Poiché i signori immortali non potevano essere distrutti, innumerevoli couatl si sacrificarono, unendo i loro spiriti in una prigione di pura energia celeste in grado di legare i signori supremi. Ancora oggi, i Signori Supremi rimangono legati e il mondo è protetto dall'immenso male grazie a questa forza, ora nota come Fiamma d'Argento.",

												"L'Era dei Demoni si è conclusa centomila anni fa, molto prima della fondazione di qualsiasi civiltà oggi esistente. Ma quell'epoca permane nel mito e continua a plasmare la vita moderna. Si ritiene comunemente che le divinità dell'Ospite Sovrano abbiano camminato nel mondo durante questo periodo e abbiano combattuto fisicamente contro i sovrani. Tuttavia, molti studiosi affermano che questi miti sono in realtà basati sulle gesta di draghi eroici: ad esempio, i miti del Sovrano Aureon potrebbero essere ispirati alle gesta di un drago di nome Ourelonastrix. Spetta al DM decidere la verità, ma potrebbe essere possibile per gli avventurieri trovare luoghi o reliquie legate ai Sovrani di quest'epoca. Potreste trovare la lancia che Dol Arrah ha usato quando ha combattuto Katashka il Guardiano della Porta, o il luogo in cui lei e Dol Dorn hanno scorticato il Burlone per il suo tradimento. Che siano legati a divinità o a draghi, questi luoghi e reliquie conservano ancora il loro potere.",
												"Anche se i Signori Supremi possono essere stati sconfitti, non possono essere distrutti. Ogni Signore Supremo è legato a una pietra del drago di Khyber e tenuto in prigione dal potere della Fiamma d'Argento. Anche se legato, un Signore Supremo può influenzare il mondo nella regione intorno alla sua prigione... e non esiste un elenco ufficiale di tutti i Signori Supremi o di dove sono legati. Quindi, se una storia richiede una regione in cui i morti inquieti si alzano e predano i vivi, questa potrebbe essere la prigione di Katashka il Guardiano della Porta. Se una regione è improvvisamente sommersa dal ghiaccio e dalla neve, forse vi è stata portata la prigione di frammenti di Dral Khatuur.",
												"Ogni Signore Supremo può essere liberato solo se si verifica un particolare passaggio della Profezia Draconica. I demoni conosciuti come Signori della Polvere lavorano per scoprire e attuare queste profezie, mentre i draghi della Camera cercano di fermarli. Entrambe le parti usano spesso i mortali come pedine, quindi gli avventurieri possono facilmente trovarsi coinvolti in questi piani. Quando raggiungono livelli più alti, gli avventurieri possono persino diventare parte attiva di questa lotta, anziché semplici pedine. Anche se pochi mortali ne sono consapevoli, questa è una costante guerra fredda che determina il destino del mondo.",
												"I dungeon dell'Età dei Demoni sono rari, pochi sopravvivono al passare del tempo. I siti rimasti sono infusi di potere demoniaco o celestiale. Un caveau creato dal couatl potrebbe contenere un artefatto mortale legato a un signore supremo. Una fortezza di ossidiana potrebbe essere impregnata del potere di Rak Tulkhesh e le persone che vi si stabiliscono sono consumate da una rabbia omicida. Uno dei siti meglio documentati è Ashtakala, un'antica città nel cuore delle Distese Demoniache che si dice sia il santuario dei Signori della Polvere."

Alcuni draghi aiutavano a guidare le creature minori, compresi i giganti di Xen'drik, nella loro padronanza della magia arcana. Quando il crescente dominio dei draghi causò un aumento del potere della Figlia di Khyber (vedi capitolo 3), i draghi furono costretti a ritirarsi in isolamento ad Argonnessen. Vi rimangono tuttora, nella speranza di impedire che il suo potere aumenti ulteriormente.",
										"Su Xen'drik sorsero diverse nazioni di giganti. La Lega Sulat era specializzata nel legame elementale e nell'allevamento di maghi. Crearono i drow come armi viventi per affrontare gli elfi ribelli e si pensa che i giganti del fuoco siano resti dei Sulat. Il Gruppo degli Undici era un'alleanza di undici città-stato, ciascuna guidata da un potente mago empireo. La loro cultura diversificata apprezzava la competizione interna ed esterna, ritenendo che guidasse l'evoluzione. Il Dominio di Cul'sir era governato da potenti empirei e cercava di dominare tutta la realtà. Esplorarono i piani e il mondo; non si sa se i Cul'sir attaccarono Dal Quor o se i quori dell'epoca cercarono di invadere Eberron, ma le due potenze combatterono una lunga guerra. I giganti posero fine al conflitto distruggendo una delle lune di Eberron con una magia cataclismatica, danneggiando la connessione planare tra Dal Quor e il mondo. Da allora, i quori non sono più in grado di viaggiare fisicamente su Eberron e non esistono più zone manifeste per Dal Quor.",
										"Queste azioni ebbero ripercussioni devastanti per la civiltà dei giganti. Nello sconvolgimento, molti sudditi dei Cul'sir colsero l'occasione per ribellarsi, ma la rivolta più grande fu quella degli elfi, sia di quelli oppressi dai Cul'sir, sia degli elfi guerrieri che non erano mai stati conquistati dai giganti. Quando i Cul'sir minacciarono di attingere ancora una volta alle loro magie più pericolose per distruggere gli elfi, i draghi emersero in forze da Argonnessen. Devastarono completamente le civiltà di Xen'drik, giganti e non, e posero sulla terra maledizioni che vanno oltre la comprensione dell'età moderna. Ancora oggi, il flagello della terra impedisce a qualsiasi civiltà avanzata di risorgere. La Maledizione del Viaggiatore deforma lo spazio e rende inaffidabili i viaggi nello Xen'drik. La maledizione nota come Du'rashka Tul - \"la follia delle folle\" - fa sì che le civiltà che diventano troppo avanzate o diffuse collassino nella follia. Si ritiene che le maledizioni draconiche siano il motivo per cui i giganti si sono trasformati da potenti titani in giganti delle colline e negli altri giganti conosciuti oggi.

Le aeronavi elementali e lo sviluppo dei warforged sono stati entrambi ispirati da scoperte legate agli antichi giganti, e una nuova scoperta potrebbe essere altrettanto importante. Una corsa per recuperare un artefatto di Cul'sir potrebbe facilmente dare vita a un'avventura, e le armi Sulat potrebbero spostare l'equilibrio del potere nel Khorvaire se cadessero nelle mani sbagliate.",

										"Dopo che Xen'drik fu distrutto dai draghi, rimase isolato ad Argonnessen. La civiltà umana stava lentamente prendendo forma su Sarlona, ma le culture più dinamiche di questo periodo si stavano formando sul continente di Khorvaire e dintorni. Gli elfi fondarono una nuova patria su Aerenal - \"il riposo di Aeren\" in elfico - istituendo la Corte degli Eterni e dando vita alle culture che sarebbero diventate gli Aereni e i Tairnadal. Su Khorvaire, i goblinoidi salirono alla ribalta, fondando l'Impero di Dhakaan circa 16.000 anni fa. Nel corso dei successivi diecimila anni, si espanse fino a dominare tutto il Khorvaire centrale. I Dhakaani hanno lentamente spinto tutti i loro concorrenti ai margini: le montagne, le terre selvagge, le marce. Si scontrarono con i dragonborn dell'attuale Q'barra, con i nani del Regno di Sotto e con gli esploratori di Tairnadal, ma nessuno riuscì a fermare l'avanzata dei Dhakaan.",
										"Tuttavia, quando i daelkyr guidarono eserciti di aberrazioni attraverso i portali di Xoriat, l'Impero di Dhakaan andò in frantumi, insieme al Regno di Sotto, la vasta civiltà sotterranea dei nani (vedi capitolo 4).",
										"Anche se questo aspro conflitto si concluse quando i campioni Dhakaani e i druidi Gatekeeper sigillarono il daelkyr a Khyber, il danno inflitto fu irreparabile. Oltre a creare mostri come i dolgaunt e i doppelganger, il daelkyr ha scatenato maledizioni più sottili e ceppi di follia. Una di queste erose il legame con il sogno condiviso dei goblinoidi che univa la civiltà di Dhakaani (vedi capitolo 4). Nel giro di poche generazioni, l'antico impero crollò in una guerra civile. Culti e crudeltà si diffusero tra i goblinoidi e presto sulla superficie di Khorvaire rimasero solo rovine e caos.",

La maggior parte delle città più importanti dell'era moderna sono costruite su fondamenta dhakaani, e sotto di esse ci sono tunnel e cunicoli che sono stati in gran parte ignorati dagli abitanti umani. Una rovina Dhakaani potrebbe essere vista come un semplice sotterraneo, ma si tratta dei resti di una civiltà orgogliosa; ciò che un avventuriero vede solo come un'utile arma magica potrebbe essere un'importante reliquia culturale dei goblin. Sebbene l'Impero non fosse così avanzato come le civiltà di giganti che lo hanno preceduto, gli artigiani daashor di Dhakaan - di cui si parla approfonditamente nel capitolo 4 - producevano artefatti notevoli ed erano maestri armaioli con una notevole conoscenza dell'adamantio e di altre leghe esotiche.",

										"I primi marchi del drago aberranti apparvero poco dopo i veri marchi del drago. All'epoca in cui le casate dei marchi del drago si unirono come Dodici, i marchi aberranti erano diffusi in tutte le Cinque Nazioni. Alcuni membri dei Dodici vedevano davvero i marchi aberranti come un abominio; altri li consideravano un comodo capro espiatorio per unire le casate e rafforzare la loro posizione. La propaganda delle Case e le campagne di sussurro amplificarono la percezione dei marchi aberranti come pericolosi e incontrollabili. La paura si trasformò in violenza e, col tempo, in squadre di soldati Deneith, segugio Vadalis e inquisitori Medani che \"proteggevano le comunità dalla minaccia degli aberranti\".",
										"I marchi di drago aberranti dell'epoca erano generalmente più potenti e pericolosi di quelli odierni. I Dodici presero storie vere di innocenti danneggiati da marchi incontrollati e le amplificarono: la superstizione e la paura fecero il resto. Il titolo \"Guerra del Marchio\" implica due parti uguali, ma si trattò più di un'epurazione che di una lotta tra pari. Verso la fine, tuttavia, alcuni campioni con marchi aberranti radunarono altri e sfidarono le case. I più famosi furono Halas Tarkanan e la Signora della Peste, che si impadronirono di Sharn e la dichiararono un rifugio per coloro che avevano marchi aberranti. Alla fine, le forze dei Dodici assediarono la città. Quando Tarkanan e la Signora videro che la vittoria era impossibile, scatenarono il pieno potere dei loro marchi. Il marchio di Tarkanan gli diede potere sulla terra e mandò in frantumi le torri. La Signora della Peste richiamò i parassiti dalle profondità e diffuse vili malattie tra le rovine. Sia gli aberranti che si rifugiavano nella città che gli eserciti che la attaccavano morirono, e Sharn rimase in rovina per secoli prima che Galifar I la reclamasse.",
										"I marchi aberranti furono quasi completamente sradicati durante la Guerra del Marchio. Quando sono riapparsi nei secoli successivi, erano molto più deboli del potere terremotante di Halas Tarkanan, ma la paura e il pregiudizio persistono. Nell'ultimo secolo, senza alcuna spiegazione, i marchi aberranti hanno iniziato a manifestarsi con maggiore frequenza e potenza. L'organizzazione criminale nota come Casa Tarkanan ha iniziato a organizzare e ad addestrare i portatori di segni aberranti, temendo che possa esserci un'altra epurazione.",

Nel tempo, il regno avrebbe promosso l'istruzione pubblica e l'ascesa della classe mercantile. Si può sostenere che Galifar sia inciampato nel dare alle casate dei marchi del drago un potere economico eccessivo; se da un lato gli Editti di Korth impediscono agli eredi dei marchi del drago di possedere terre o titoli, dall'altro gettano le basi per i quasi monopoli che le casate detengono oggi.",

										"Nell'832 YK, il Guardiano della Fiamma Jolan Sol dichiarò che la licantropia corrompeva l'anima stessa e doveva essere completamente eliminata. Un esercito di templari fu inviato ad Aundair e ai servitori della Fiamma di tutto il Khorvaire fu ordinato di vigilare e di estirpare i licantropi nascosti. E così fecero.",
										"La Crociata d'argento durò quasi cinquant'anni. I primi due decenni furono una campagna brutale e sanguinosa. I licantropi si stavano ammassando in gran numero ai margini del Bosco delle Torri (ora parte delle Rive di Eldeen), spinti da un male sconosciuto; la maggior parte dei saggi ritiene che si trattasse di un signore supremo sul punto di spezzare i suoi legami. I templari erano in inferiorità numerica. I licantropi erano astuti e in grado di ricostituire rapidamente il loro numero, e intenzionalmente fomentavano il conflitto tra templari e mutaforma. Ma dopo decenni di aspro conflitto, la situazione si è lentamente ribaltata a favore dei templari. In qualche modo, il potere della maledizione fu spezzato. La licantropia continuò, ma i suoi effetti non erano così forti, le sue vittime non erano così spinte verso l'oscurità.",
										"Mentre la vera minaccia veniva affrontata, i contadini di Aundair avevano sofferto decenni di terrore e cercavano una vendetta più grande. I trent'anni successivi videro una continua inquisizione, mentre zelanti convertiti alla fede - in seguito classificati come una setta estremista, la Fiamma Pura - cercavano di dare la caccia a ogni licantropo rimasto. Nel corso del processo, molti innocenti - tra cui moltissimi mutaforma - furono torturati e uccisi. La Crociata d'Argento nacque come un atto altruistico che avrebbe potuto salvare Galifar, ma finì per diventare uno sfogo per la paranoia e l'odio.",

È l'origine della Fiamma Pura, una setta estremista la cui visione ristretta della Fiamma è quella di un'arma spietata con cui bruciare i malfattori. Questo ha creato una profonda spaccatura tra i mutaforma e i seguaci della Fiamma d'Argento e ha danneggiato la reputazione dei mutaforma di tutto il mondo.",
												"Sulla scia della Crociata d'Argento, la licantropia è considerata un grave rischio per la salute pubblica. I Templari si occupano dei licantropi accertati: quando è possibile, cercano di arrestarli e curarli, ma la forza letale è sempre un'opzione. I licantropi possono trovare un rifugio sicuro a Droaam (soprattutto con il Branco Oscuro), e ci sono ancora alcuni 'thropes sparsi a Stormreach, Q'barra, Darguun e in altre nazioni di frontiera.",

										"Galifar Wynarn era un genio militare, ma fu sua figlia maggiore Cyre, gemella di Aundair, a immaginare che le nazioni in guerra lavorassero insieme come un'unica famiglia: La forza dei Karrnathi, la fede dei Daskari e la saggezza di Thaliost che lavorano insieme per il bene comune. Nel delineare la mappa del regno unito, Galifar dichiarò che Cire sarebbe stato il cuore del regno. Sua figlia avrebbe governato la provincia e avrebbe avuto tutto il necessario per perseguire la sua visione. Lo stemma di Cyre è costituito da una corona e una campana su un campo verde, sopra un martello e un mantice: la sede della corona, la campana che suona nel cambiamento e gli strumenti per costruire il futuro. Il motto di Cyre cattura il cuore di questa nazione e del suo popolo: \"Ciò che i nostri sogni immaginano, le nostre mani creano\".",
										"Le province di Galifar mantennero in gran parte le culture e le tradizioni delle nazioni che erano state un tempo. In molti modi, le loro differenze furono rafforzate e celebrate. A ogni nazione fu assegnato uno dei pilastri del regno unito: il Congresso Arcano ad Aundair, la Cittadella del Re a Breland, l'Accademia Rekkenmark a Karrnath, il Grande Tempio di Thrane. Cyre era un'eccezione. Piuttosto che basarsi sulla cultura esistente di Metrol, Cyre attirava esperti e artigiani da tutto il Galifar. Invece di essere il centro di una singola disciplina, Cyre era il punto di incontro di tutte queste cose, il meglio di ciò che Galifar poteva essere. Quando il Congresso Arcano perfezionò il {@item everbright lantern|ERLW}, Metrol fu la prima città le cui strade ne furono illuminate. I soldati si addestravano a Rekkenmark, ma i migliori guerrieri prestavano servizio nella Guardia Vermishard. Se Metrol era il fiore all'occhiello, la città delle meraviglie, questo principio fu applicato in tutta la Cirenaia centrale. Con l'istruzione, l'arte e persino l'agricoltura, Cyre mostrava il meglio di ciò che Galifar poteva realizzare.",
										"Questo è continuato e si è evoluto nel corso dei secoli. I Karrn sono duri, i Thranes saggi, i Brelander industriosi, gli Aundairiani intelligenti. Il popolo di Cyre può far risalire le proprie radici a tutte queste nazioni, ritenendo di condividere questi punti di forza; inoltre, i Cyran si sforzano di essere creativi, innovativi e artistici.",
										"Il temperamento artistico (e, qualcuno potrebbe dire, capriccioso) di Cyre era bilanciato e sostenuto dalla presenza della Casa Cannith, con sede nella grande città di Making. Molte delle più grandi fucine di Cannith erano sparse in tutta Cyre, fornendo una base industriale pratica che sosteneva le meraviglie di Cyre. E queste meraviglie assumevano molte forme. Mentre il Congresso Arcano di Aundair si concentrava sulle applicazioni pratiche della magia, l'Istituto Wynarn di Cyre esplorava il potenziale artistico dell'arcano. Metrol era una città di luce e meraviglie. I visitatori potevano parlare con le illusioni di eroi e re del passato o assistere a rievocazioni di momenti storici. Si dice che a Metrol nessuno abbia mai patito la fame o sentito i morsi dell'inverno. I ciriani sostengono che ciò riflette la generosità e l'altruismo dello spirito ciriano; i critici sottolineano che questi progetti sociali erano possibili solo grazie alle tasse pagate dagli abitanti delle altre province. Certamente, Cyre deteneva la ricchezza di Galifar e aveva un tenore di vita superiore a qualsiasi altra provincia. Si trattava di decadenza? O era un lavoro in corso, un modello che un giorno avrebbe potuto essere applicato a tutte le nazioni? Non c'è modo di saperlo. I ciriani piangono ciò che è andato perduto; gli abitanti delle altre nazioni criticano lo stile di vita ciriano come parassitario. \"Ciò che i nostri sogni immaginano, le nostre mani lo creano\", ma gli estranei sottolineano con amarezza che le mani dei Cyran possono aver costruito, ma hanno usato risorse raccolte dal duro lavoro di altri.",
										"Questa amarezza fu ulteriormente alimentata dalle tradizioni di successione di Galifar. Seguendo l'esempio di Galifar I, i figli del monarca servivano come governatori delle cinque province. Il più anziano governava Cyre e, alla morte del monarca, avrebbe assunto la corona e i suoi figli avrebbero assunto le posizioni di governo di ogni provincia. I governatori precedenti avrebbero servito come reggenti fino a quando i figli fossero stati maggiorenni e, in seguito, come consiglieri. Quando un monarca non aveva cinque figli, i governatori precedenti mantenevano le cariche.

Galifar I voleva le terre dell'antica Metrol, quindi diede ai suoi nobili l'autorità sulla Cire orientale, ponendoli come signori feudali dei coloni di Khunan. Il Deserto delle Lame fungeva da divisione fisica e culturale e, dopo aver concesso ai nobili le loro terre, Galifar li ignorò ampiamente.

Tutti sapevano che la Cire aveva il meglio di tutto: i migliori maghi, i migliori soldati, i più importanti artefici. Da un certo punto di vista, questo era vero, ma una singola unità di soldati eccezionali significa poco se confrontata con le culture marziali di Karrnath o Thrane. I migliori maghi di Cyre erano artisti e studiosi teorici, mentre Aundair aveva lavorato a lungo sulla magia come strumento di guerra. Inoltre, gli esperti artificeri erano in gran parte legati alla Casa Cannith, che è rimasta neutrale nella guerra. Se si considerano le nazioni come personaggi, Thrane è un paladino, Karrnath è un combattente, Aundair è un mago e Breland è un ladro.

A Cyre mancava lo spirito marziale di Karrnath o Thrane, ma la sua gente era sostenuta dall'assoluta convinzione di essere nel giusto. Inoltre, agli occhi del popolo, Cyre era Galifar. Incarnava gli ideali del regno, il meglio di ciò che poteva essere - e questo era qualcosa per cui valeva la pena combattere. Ciononostante, la lotta assestò un colpo tremendo alla psiche dei Cyran. Per secoli, i Cyran si erano visti come le stelle dello spettacolo, amati da tutti; ora tutte le mani erano alzate contro di loro e alcuni, almeno, potevano vedere le loro precedenti convinzioni come arroganza e narcisismo. Cyre aveva sì avuto il meglio di tutto, ma perché era stato dato gratuitamente. Ora il Congresso Arcano dedicava le sue conoscenze esclusivamente al bene di Aundair, Rekkenmark addestrava solo i Karrn e la Cittadella del Re serviva Breland. Sì, Cyre aveva l'eco di tutte queste cose. I suoi maghi erano ancora all'altezza di qualsiasi nazione che non fosse Aundair e la Guardia Vermishard costituiva il nucleo della nuova accademia militare di Cyre.

I Cyran credono che non esista un unico percorso perfetto; la diversità è una fonte di forza, ma c'è sempre spazio per il miglioramento. La cultura Cyran è quindi una strana chimera, una miscela di elementi familiari provenienti da tutto il Khorvaire combinati con una costante e continua evoluzione. Un musicista Cyran potrebbe suonare nenie funebri Karrnathi nello stile di una devozione Thrane; è un puzzle in cui i pezzi sono noti, ma vengono costantemente disposti in modi nuovi.

Quando si richiedevano grandi numeri, le nazioni impiegavano leve di contadini, la maggior parte dei quali utilizzava il blocco di statistiche {@creature commoner}, con soli 4 punti ferita.",

La gamma di punti ferita da 4 a 11 è normale; una persona tipica della strada potrebbe essere ferita mortalmente da un singolo dardo di balestra ben piazzato. Gli alti punti ferita di individui eccezionali, come i personaggi dei giocatori, riflettono il loro ruolo di eroi, persone che in qualche modo evitano un colpo mortale o che riescono a stringere i denti e a resistere a danni che manderebbero in shock una persona inferiore. Quando progettavano armi e magie da battaglia, i maghi di Arcanix e gli artificeri dei Dodici usavano come base il tipico soldato, non un personaggio giocante.",

È pensata per una squadra d'élite che combatte contro nemici eccezionali: infligge danni elevati con un'area d'effetto significativa. Ma immaginate di dover combattere contro 120 guardie con archi lunghi, che iniziano a sparare contro di voi una volta entrati nel loro lungo raggio di 600 piedi. Potreste non avvicinarvi mai abbastanza per lanciare il vostro {@spell fireball}. Anche se ci riuscite, il danno prodotto è di gran lunga superiore a quello necessario (una media di 28 danni contro nemici con 11 punti ferita). La {@spell Fireball} è uno strumento eccellente per una piccola squadra che affronta nemici potenti, il che descrive il tipico gruppo di avventurieri. Ma su un campo di battaglia di soldati comuni, si rivela inefficiente, poiché la portata e il raggio d'azione sono più importanti di un'elevata produzione di danni. Il {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} può non infliggere tanti danni quanto un {@item staff of fire}, ma colpisce più nemici e da più lontano.",

Nell'interesse della storia, il DM non vuole che il vostro gruppo venga spazzato via dalla prima esplosione di un {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}; come sarebbe un'avventura avvincente? Invece, quell'esplosione potrebbe infliggere solo 12 punti di danno da fuoco. Fa cadere metà dei soldati che vi accompagnano (che hanno fallito i tiri salvezza), ma voi e i vostri compagni vi riparate dal peggio dell'esplosione e continuate ad avanzare. Il danno {@damage 3d6} può sembrare basso perché non uccide un personaggio. Il fatto che gli avventurieri riescano ad andare avanti sotto il fuoco dimostra quanto siano notevoli."

Secondo i principi dell'ampia magia di Eberron, gli oggetti comuni e non comuni fanno parte dell'industria magica; gli oggetti rari sono esotici e costosi; gli oggetti molto rari e leggendari sono in gran parte al di là delle capacità di Cannith e del Congresso Arcano. Per questo motivo, armi come un {@item wand of fireballs} o un {@item wand of lightning bolts} potevano essere trovate sul campo di battaglia, soprattutto quando si aveva a che fare con Aundair, ma erano rare, assegnate solo a unità d'élite e a operazioni critiche.",

Le versioni precedenti della bacchetta erano più costose, potevano essere usate solo da incantatori esperti o non recuperavano le cariche. La {@item wand of magic missiles} rompe questa barriera: è un oggetto magico non comune che non richiede sintonia e può essere usato da qualsiasi creatura. Un ricco bacchettatore potrebbe portare con sé un paio di bacchette, scatenando una raffica di dardi da una nuova bacchetta a ogni round. {@item Wands of magic missiles} possono essere trovate nelle mani di criminali, guardie reali o qualsiasi altro professionista e possono essere acquistate in tutte le Cinque Nazioni. Tuttavia, sono state perfezionate dal Congresso Arcano solo dodici anni fa e la Casa Cannith non ha ancora replicato questa tecnica. Di conseguenza, queste bacchette si trovano principalmente ad Aundair o sono usate dagli Aundairiani; una bacchetta venduta a Sharn potrebbe essere un'eccedenza o un residuo recuperato dai soldati aundairiani durante la guerra.",

In genere, queste piattaforme ospitano arcieri, fornendo al warforged un minimo di supporto a distanza per integrare i suoi potenti attacchi in mischia. Tuttavia, un equipaggio specializzato può aumentare drasticamente le capacità di un titano: un evocatore può fornire forti attacchi a distanza, mentre un abiuratore può essere pronto a contrastare o disperdere la magia nemica e un artificere di bordo può mantenere il titano operativo. Vuoi inviare il tuo titano contro i non morti di Karrnathi? Un esorcista può essere un vantaggio per affrontare i non morti. In alternativa, un titano può servire semplicemente come ariete, trasportando due spie o commando pronti a saltare fuori e a confondersi con la comunità nemica non appena il titano sfonda un muro difensivo.",

								"Come uno degli Aereni, percorri un cammino diverso da quello della gente di Khorvaire. Siete nati in un regno custodito e guidato da spiriti antichi e potenti. Avete imparato lezioni da maestri il cui corpo è morto migliaia di anni fa e sapete che anche i secoli di vita che vi aspettano sono solo l'inizio del viaggio della vostra anima. Il vostro popolo possiede conoscenze arcane che vanno oltre la portata di Aundair; i sacerdoti della Corte degli Eterni esercitano poteri pari solo a quelli del Custode della Fiamma. Venite da una terra di meraviglie, un regno letteralmente guidato da forze divine. In breve, il vostro popolo ha già raggiunto la perfezione. In quanto elfo Aereni, non ci si aspetta che {@i improve} la vostra società; il vostro compito è dimostrare di esserne degni e guadagnarvi la vita ultraterrena.",
								"Gli elfi Aereni hanno la reputazione di essere arroganti e condiscendenti. Perché non dovreste esserlo voi? Gli umani sono come bambini per voi, con le loro vite brevi e la loro disperazione di fare le cose in fretta, senza badare alla qualità dei loro sforzi. Anche gli elfi che si sono stabiliti a Khorvaire hanno abbandonato le tradizioni dei loro antenati e della loro patria benedetta. È facile essere compiaciuti... ma chi vuole avere intorno quel personaggio? Un elfo Aereni non deve per forza essere sgradevole. Come uno degli Aereni, sei un viaggiatore proveniente da un regno misterioso e magico. Possiedi un'antica saggezza e un legame con gli spiriti divini. Inoltre, la Corte degli Eterni è una delle poche forze al mondo che ha intravisto la Profezia Draconica. Siete venuti a Khorvaire come emissario della Corte degli Innocenti, sia come diplomatico che come agente della profezia? Lavorate per conto di una famiglia nobile, perseguite interessi mercantili o cercate un artefatto rubato al vostro popolo molto tempo fa? Siete un antropologo affascinato dal comportamento dell'umanità? Siete un paladino al servizio della Guardia della Morte, incaricato di sterminare i non morti ovunque si trovino? Oppure siete un esule, cacciato dalla vostra patria e costretto a vivere tra i barbari?",

										"Aerenal è una nazione isolata e poco interessata al mondo esterno. Non temono la conquista: il potere divino della Corte degli Imperdonabili ha respinto gli assalti di legioni di draghi. Ma il potere della Corte degli Imperdonabili non si estende oltre Aerenal e gli elfi hanno scelto di rimanere nel loro rifugio piuttosto che espandersi in tutto il mondo. Da quest'isola-santuario hanno visto sorgere e cadere l'Impero di Dhakaan e si aspettano di essere presenti molto tempo dopo che le Cinque Nazioni saranno cadute in polvere.

												"Aerenal è governata dai vivi. I Re Sibling guidano la nazione da Shae Cairdal, e gli alti sacerdoti e i signori delle linee sono elfi mortali. Ma i morti guidano e proteggono i vivi. Quando gli elfi notevoli muoiono, si conservano oltre la morte. La maggior parte viene legata a {@i spirit idols}, statuette che preservano l'anima e ne impediscono la dissoluzione nel Dolurrh. Altri, invece, vengono resuscitati come non-morti, non-morti simili alle mummie ma sostenuti dall'energia positiva. I soldati senza morte sorvegliano le catacombe e i templi, mentre i saggi e i consiglieri senza morte condividono la loro conoscenza e saggezza con i loro discendenti. Con il tempo, i senza morte possono elevarsi a uno stato ancora più elevato, diventando esseri di puro spirito che non hanno bisogno di un corpo. Questi spiriti, noti come consiglieri ascendenti, risiedono nella grande città di Shae Mordai ed è quando i loro spiriti si uniscono in una gestalt mistica che esercitano il potere divino.",
												"Molti estranei pensano che i consiglieri ascendenti siano la Corte dei Non Morti, ed è vero che sono la fonte del suo potere. Ma la Corte dei Non Morti si riferisce al {@i all} dei guardiani non morti dell'isola, dai soldati al {@i spirit idols}. Non ci si può aspettare di diventare un consigliere ascendente - si tratta di un processo evolutivo che in genere richiede migliaia di anni - ma si può aspirare a entrare a far parte della Corte dei Non Morti dopo la morte.",
												"In quanto Aereni, avete un'acuta consapevolezza del dovere che avete nei confronti della Corte degli Eterni. I Senza Morte sono sostenuti da energia positiva; questa può essere attinta dalle zone manifeste di Irian, come quella di Shae Mordai, ma è anche generata dall'amore e dalla devozione. A differenza di molte religioni di Eberron, la Corte dei Senza Morte non si basa sulla fede; non c'è dubbio che la Corte esista. Ma dipende dalla devozione. Le vostre preghiere e la vostra fede sono l'offerta che fate in cambio di tutto ciò che la Corte ha fatto per voi e per il vostro popolo: dal proteggere la vostra terra dalle invasioni, dalle pestilenze e dai disastri naturali al guidare i vostri capi e addestrare i vostri giovani. I vostri antenati vi proteggono, ma hanno anche bisogno della vostra devozione per sopravvivere."

												"Lo stato di assenza di morte non è l'unico modo per sperimentare l'eternità. La maggior parte dei morti onorati di Aerenal sono conservati in idoli spiritici che preservano l'anima dalla dissoluzione del Dolurrh. Questo busto di pietra di un elfo morto contiene reliquie del suo cadavere (frammenti di ossa, una ciocca di capelli) incastonate al suo interno. Quando è dormiente, lo spirito all'interno dell'idolo non è consapevole del mondo esterno o del passare del tempo, esistendo in una continua trance, un'esistenza onirica costruita da ricordi ed esperienze personali. Un {@i spirit idol} può essere risvegliato con l'incantesimo {@spell speak with dead}, anche se alcuni rimangono coscienti a tempo indeterminato e possono essere trovati come precettori, prevosti e giudici.",
												"Non tutti gli Aereni vogliono diventare senza morte: molti considerano il {@i spirit idol} lo stato superiore. I senza morte hanno giurato di proteggere e servire i vivi e devono affrontare i continui inconvenienti dell'esistenza fisica; in un {@i spirit idol}, un elfo può sperimentare la pace eterna in un sogno di sua creazione. Per molti Aereni, il loro più grande obiettivo in vita è raccogliere i ricordi e le idee che saranno i loro compagni nella trance eterna dopo la morte.",
												"Sebbene ci sia un numero maggiore di {@i spirit idols} rispetto ai senza morte, non tutti i morti sono conservati in questo modo. {@i Spirit idols} sono riservati a coloro che si sono dimostrati degni dell'esistenza eterna. I morti comuni vengono imbalsamati dopo la morte e sepolti nelle vaste catacombe sotto la terra, insieme a una registrazione della loro vita. Solo a coloro che hanno commesso crimini veramente efferati, come i profanatori di tombe, viene negata la memoria; questi criminali vengono bruciati dopo la morte, le loro ceneri disperse negli oceani e non viene conservata alcuna traccia della loro vita."

												"A prima vista, gli abitanti di Aerenal sono semplicemente più bravi in tutto rispetto alle loro controparti di Khorvaire, grazie alla loro eccezionale etica del lavoro e alla lunga durata della vita. Un artigiano Aereni può trascorrere più vite umane a perfezionare il proprio mestiere. Anche mentre è in trance, un elfo può contemplare il proprio lavoro. Tuttavia, Aerenal è in ritardo rispetto a Khorvaire nell'industria e nell'innovazione. Gli Aereni non cercano di trovare modi migliori per fare le cose; l'obiettivo di un artigiano elfo è quello di eguagliare le abilità dei maestri del passato piuttosto che trovare nuove tecniche. Sfidare il passato sarebbe un insulto a quegli antichi maestri, che ad Aerenal sono ancora in circolazione e insegnano ancora le loro tecniche. Un artificere Aereni può produrre un oggetto magico molto raro che nessuna forgia Cannith può eguagliare, ma si tratta di un'opera d'arte artigianale che richiede anni per essere prodotta, mentre la forgia Cannith sforna una miriade di oggetti comuni e non comuni e cerca costantemente modi per innovare. Le Cinque Nazioni possono non essere all'altezza di Aerenal oggi, ma negli ultimi mille anni si sono evolute drammaticamente, mentre Aerenal è rimasta ferma. Non siete mai stati incoraggiati a innovare; vi è stato insegnato che {@i the old ways are the best ways}. Siete d'accordo con questo?"

I coloni originari di Aerenal provenivano da culture e ambienti diversi e le casate ne sono la rappresentazione; pur essendo tutti uniti dai costumi comuni di Aerenal, ogni casata ha le proprie mode e tradizioni uniche. Una linea è un'alleanza di antiche famiglie governate da una casa nobile che porta il nome della linea. Così, \"la stirpe di Mendyrian\" si riferisce a più famiglie, ma chi usa il cognome - come Belaereth Mendyrian - è un membro della stirpe nobile. La linea nobile rappresenta il meglio della regione; non è una famiglia ereditaria, ma piuttosto una meritocrazia i cui membri sono scelti tra gli abitanti della regione. Allo stesso modo, i Re fratelli - i sovrani del regno unito - sono membri della stessa linea e simbolicamente fratello e sorella, ma non sono parenti di sangue. In vita, quindi, gli elfi aspirano a essere nominati nella loro linea nobiliare; in morte, sperano di essere elevati alla Corte degli Eterni.",

										"I mutaforma e i licantropi sono chiaramente correlati. Entrambi si trasformano in uno stato più bestiale. I mutaforma hanno affinità con l'orso, il cinghiale, il ratto e il lupo; potrebbe essere una semplice coincidenza che queste siano le forme più comuni di licantropo? Eppure, le differenze tra mutaforma e licantropo sono enormi. Essere un mutaforma non è una condizione che si può trasmettere con un morso. I mutaforma hanno il pieno controllo dei loro doni, mentre i licantropi lottano con essi. La bestia interiore può plasmare la personalità di un mutaforma, ma non la sopraffà. Al contrario, la licantropia cerca di distruggere la personalità originale della vittima e può trasformare l'eroe più virtuoso in un assassino assetato di sangue. I mannari e i licantropi sono crudeli assassini... ma Nonna Lupa non incoraggia la ferocia e Nonno Topo non esorta all'omicidio. E forse la cosa più importante è che i mutaforma stessi possono diventare licantropi. Non è nel loro sangue; la licantropia è una maledizione e può affliggerli come qualsiasi altro umanoide.",
										"I druidi Moonspeaker raccontano la storia di cinque campioni mutaforma che si avventurarono troppo in profondità nel Bosco delle Torri. Davano la caccia a un grande male, ma quando lo catturarono ne furono sopraffatti; la sua malvagità riempì i loro cuori e li rimandò a predare i loro amici e le loro famiglie. Se qualcuno sopravviveva ai loro attacchi, il male filtrava dalla ferita e avvelenava anche i loro cuori. Si dice che questi siano stati i primi licantropi.",
										"La Crociata d'Argento ebbe inizio quando un potere oscuro si diffuse nel Bosco delle Torri, amplificando il potere della licantropia. La maledizione divenne più virulenta. Le vittime caddero preda del suo potere più rapidamente, guidate da un potere oscuro che andava oltre il male comune della maledizione. All'interno del Bosco delle Torri, tribù di mutaforma combattevano i loro parenti corrotti. Al di là di esso, i contadini di Aundair erano tormentati dalle incursioni di lupi e cinghiali. Quando i templari intervennero, le bestie uccise tornarono alla loro forma naturale, rivelando di essere mutaforma. La voce si diffuse rapidamente: tutti i mutaforma erano stati toccati, capaci di trasformarsi in bestie selvagge. Non ci si poteva fidare di nessuno! Nel frattempo, tra le tribù di mutaforma, gli esploratori avvertivano delle atrocità commesse dai soldati stranieri. In realtà, i demagoghi di entrambe le parti si adoperavano per far sì che questi possibili alleati diventassero invece acerrimi nemici... e il trucco funzionava. Templari spaventati e folle paranoiche uccisero molti mutaforma innocenti, e ancora oggi la setta estremista nota come Fiamma Pura sostiene che tutti i mutaforma sono servi dell'oscurità.",
										"Il fatto è che {@i lycanthropy is a weapon}; si diffonde attraverso la violenza e trasforma le sue vittime in assassini. Forse le sue origini non saranno mai scoperte, ma la storia del Moonspeaker è logica quanto altre. Licantropi e mutaforma sono collegati in quanto i primi licantropi erano mutaforma maledetti. La forza sconosciuta responsabile è stata probabilmente anche dietro l'ondata che ha causato la Crociata d'Argento e potrebbe risorgere di nuovo. Un contendente logico è il daelkyr noto come Dyrrn il Corruttore. Si dice che Dyrrn abbia creato dei doppelganger distorcendo i mutaforma; potrebbe aver usato questa stessa tecnica per creare licantropi dai mutaforma. Oppure potrebbe essere opera di un signore supremo, un arcidemone dell'Era dei Demoni; alcuni testi parlano del Cuore Selvaggio, un signore supremo che distrugge le civiltà e si nutre di crudeltà primordiale. In definitiva, spetta al DM decidere se la risposta verrà rivelata e, in caso affermativo, quale sia. Nel combattere i culti del Drago di Sotto, potreste affrontare i campioni originali dei mutaforma corrotti da Dyrrn? Oppure i piani dei Signori della Polvere potrebbero scatenare il Cuore Selvaggio?",
										"Sebbene i mutaforma e i licantropi non siano la stessa cosa, la storia e lo stereotipo sono ben consolidati. Tutti chiamano i mutaforma \"mannari\". Al di là del Bosco delle Torri, ci sono molti mutaforma che credono di essere licantropi dal sangue sottile. E le ferite causate dalla Crociata d'Argento e dalla Fiamma Pura non si rimargineranno mai completamente. Ma nonostante lo stereotipo, i mutaforma del Bosco Torreggiante temono e combattono i licantropi malvagi, e le loro tribù comprendono ranger Ammazzamostri specializzati nella caccia ai lupi mannari. Mutaforma e licantropi si assomigliano, ma non sono la stessa cosa, e i mutaforma sono vulnerabili alla maledizione della licantropia tanto quanto gli umani."

Regardless, you still have to perform similar actions to a wizard; to cast a {@spell fireball}, you still need somatic gestures and verbal incantations along with a ball of guano or an arcane focus.

But the same basic science underlies them both, and the principles of verbal and somatic components are familiar, even if the precise gestures or words are different. You can decide your character breaks this tradition, but this doesn't change any mechanical rules. You might say that your bard uses divine magic to cast spells\u2014singing prayers to the Sovereigns, for example.

This doesn't mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can't think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.",

In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist\u2014if Onatar actually guides all artisans or if Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not Dol Arrah exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be Dol Arrah granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who's spent decades studying texts doesn't? People of faith usually respond that it's because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that's true, or maybe it's all just luck.",

A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: \"Dol Arrah smite my foe!\" or \"Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!\" Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn't just ask for something; they reach out and {@i take} the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it'll be exhausted until they can rest."

Consider a paladin who discovers or does something that deeply undermines their faith. If the character simply loses their class features, no one will have fun. But you could redesign the character as a fighter of the same level, reflecting the idea that their divine abilities are gone, but they're still a tough, hardbitten warrior. Or in reverse, you could start a campaign playing a fighter as a former paladin who lost your way; if you find redemption or new faith over the course of the campaign, you could eventually redesign the character to be a full paladin.",

This is an imperfect process, and it's up to both player and DM to find ways to push past this and explain them within the story: {@i \"My armor was a prison. Now that I've embraced the light, I can't bear to carry the weight of war on my shoulders.\"} It's important to maintain game balance, even if it means overlooking a few blips in the story. But changing beliefs can be a good reason for a dramatic mechanical shift within a character. Ultimately, your beliefs\u2014or lack thereof\u2014don't have to be limited by a class choice you made at 1st level.

The Church of the Silver Flame celebrates the Keeper of the Flame as being both the vessel of the Voice and the channel for the power of the Flame. However, the faithful of other cultures\u2014such as the Ghaash'kala of the Demon Wastes\u2014see the Keeper as a powerful priest and nothing more.",
										"The Church of the Silver Flame is largely willing to overlook the divergent beliefs of groups like the Ghaash'kala. In the church's eyes, these northern orcs are a curiosity and their unusual beliefs don't threaten the faithful of the Five Nations. Likewise, the Council of Cardinals has taken no action to suppress the extreme beliefs of the Pure Flame, even going so far as appointing the puritan Archbishop Dariznu as governor of Thaliost. In part, this is because the Pure Flame came into its own over the course of the Last War, and the cardinals of Thrane had little ability to enforce their will over the faithful of Aundair. Dariznu's appointment was an effort to ensure that the followers of the Pure Flame would accept the authority of Flamekeep. Despite the church thus far taking no action against the Pure Flame, Keeper Daran is deeply troubled by this sect and is considering the best way to address the problem.",
										"There have been times when heretical beliefs divided the church, the most infamous known as the Time of Two Keepers. In 497 YK, a peasant woman calling herself Melysse Miron challenged Keeper Kyra Danth for control of Flamekeep and the Church of the Silver Flame. Melysse claimed that Tira Miron had revealed she was Tira's direct descendant and the rightful Keeper. She challenged many church doctrines and claimed it had strayed from its path. And like Keeper Danth, Melysse was shockingly able to wield the power of the fountain of fire in Flamekeep, performing miracles no lesser priest could match. This triggered a deep schism that lasted for years, until Melysse was finally revealed to be the chosen hand of the Shadow in the Flame\u2014it was not the Silver Flame, but rather the overlord Bel Shalor, that strengthened her in Flamekeep. Because of the fear that her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose a new AntiKeeper, Melysse wasn't killed; instead, she was petrified and placed in Dreadhold, where she remains to this day.",
										"More recently, the church was divided in 914 YK when Keeper Serrain was invested with temporal authority over the nation of Thrane. While many celebrated the idea of a kingdom founded on the noble principles of the church, there are many\u2014even some in Thrane itself\u2014who believe that investing cardinals and Keeper with political power distracts the church from its proper mission and serves as an invitation to corruption. This served as justification for the foreign templars who fought against Thrane in the Last War; they argued that they continued to respect the spiritual authority of the Keeper, but that the church shouldn't rule a reunited Galifar. The priests of Stormreach went so far as to condemn the theocracy and Keeper Serrain. In the wake of this division, Stormreach was formally severed from Flamekeep; it receives no support and Flamekeep doesn't acknowledge its priests within the church hierarchy. As such, Stormreach has become a haven for those who believe in the principles of the Flame but question its doctrine.",

On the eve of her battle with Bel Shalor, Tira charged her trusted companion Samyr Kes to monitor the Church that was to come for signs of fiendish corruption\u2014to save those who could be saved, and eliminate those who could not. Those who believe these tales say that it was agents of Miron's Tears who recognized the threat of Melysse Miron and exposed her as an agent of Bel Shalor.",

The line of Vol was a noble line of Aerenal, as described in chapter 2, with a long tradition of necromancy tracing its roots back to Xen'drik. When members of the line of Vol developed the dragonmark known as the Mark of Death, they undertook a risky series of experiments designed to unlock its full powers. This ended when the Undying Court and the dragons of Argonnessen joined forces to eradicate the bloodlines that carried the Mark of Death. In the aftermath of this brutal purge, those elves who had supported Vol but didn't bear its blood were given the choice of exile or swearing fealty to the Sibling Kings of Aerenal. This resulted in a wave of exiled elves settling in the Lhazaar Principalities and spreading west into the lands that are now Karrnath.",
												"These exiles brought the knowledge of necromancy along with stories of how the heroic family of Vol had sought to attain godhood, only to be destroyed by the jealous gods. The people of the region knew nothing of Aereni traditions or dragonmarks, and they blended this story with their own experience of life in a harsh land, local tyrants, and the empty promises of Sovereign priests. And in the process, they somehow discovered something real. The line of Vol had never sought the divinity within, but these first priests found it, drawing divine power from their own conviction and their own souls.",
												"So despite its name, the religion was never practiced by the line of Vol, nor by the infamous Erandis Vol herself, who was in hiding during the period in which the faith evolved. It is a faith born of the blending of elf and human myths and traditions. While the faithful believe that \"Vol\" was the first person to find the divinity within and challenge the curse of mortality, the faith is based around the divinity within each of us, not the worship of this mythical Vol. Even devoted priests of Vol do not know Erandis Vol's identity, though they respect the name of \"Vol\" as author of their core texts, believing that this Vol challenged the Sovereigns, then was subsequently destroyed by these jealous gods\u2014a martyr of the faith. Modern Seeker scholars debate the origins of the name, whether Vol was an individual or a group of people, or related to the elven line at all.

												"The Blood of Vol emerged from collaboration with Aereni necromancers, and the undead have always been associated with the faith. First and foremost, this link is born out of practicality. Seekers have no reverence for corpses; the divinity within is tied to life and to the soul, and once those things are gone, what's left is just meat and bone. As an extension of this, most Seekers want their corpses to be put to use. The faith is driven by the idea of serving a community\u2014why let your corpse go to waste when it can help your friends and family? As such, mindless undead are commonly seen in Seeker communities serving as guardians, performing manual labor, and completing other simple tasks.",
												"However, a common misconception is that Seekers want to become undead. Some do, driven purely by the fear of oblivion, but undeath is a miserable half-life, not a triumph. The divinity within is bound to your blood and your soul, so Seekers believe that the souls of undead are trapped in their corpses, the spark of divinity lost to them. Those who embrace undeath are seen as martyrs, and generally expected to protect and serve their Seeker community. One of the most public of these champions is the mummy lord Malevanor, the high priest of Atur. The former high priest of Atur was the mummy Askalor, who held the post for over four hundred years\u2014but he was weary of his long undead existence. When Malevanor was grievously injured during the Last War, Askalor transferred his power and his undead existence to his apprentice. This raises an interesting question: if the divinity within lies in the blood, how does Malevanor cast divine magic? The answer is that Seeker communities ritually draw their blood and share it with these champions. Vampires drink this blood, while mummies or liches may bathe in it. Through this, undead priests draw their power from the blood of the living faithful.",
												"Another factor in the long association between the Blood of Vol and necromancy is that Seeker communities have often formed in or near manifest zones to Mabar. While such areas are often inhospitable or dangerous, over the course of many centuries, Seekers have learned how to tap the energies of these places. Because Mabaran manifest zones are usually blighted, outsiders often accuse the Seekers of causing blights. In reality, the Seekers often perform rituals that limit the negative effects of the manifest zones\u2014so instead of causing the plagues and blights associated with Mabar, they often prevent them."

One simple answer is for the DM to use a being who has the statistics of a celestial or fiend, but that is formed from blood and magic; it's a manifestation of your own divine essence and fades away when its work is done. This might seem a strange match for {@spell planar ally}, a spell that normally requires payment to an external force, but even an ally of your own essence might demand a service in return. This could be seen as a request from your subconscious\u2014a demand that you do something you know you should do, but that you've been trying to ignore. On the other hand, it could be a mysterious task with no discernible purpose; this ties to the fact that your Divinity Within is something beyond mere mortal understanding, and you don't fully understand what it needs or wants.",
												"Another possibility is that you're drawing on the Seeker community rather than reaching to the planes for assistance. One principle of the faith is that champions become undead so that they can help other Seekers. When you cast {@spell planar ally}, rather than calling a celestial or fiend, you might summon an undead champion of your faith; this could be anything from a vampire to a mummy lord or a death knight. In this case, the payment they demand for their service would likely be a tithe to the Seeker temple they are bound to. On a smaller scale, your DM could similarly decide that when you cast {@spell conjure celestial}, it summons a sarcastic flameskull instead of an angel."

												"Throughout its history, the Blood of Vol has been treated with fear and suspicion by the people of the Five Nations. It's a faith that has dwelled in the shadows. This changed early in the Last War. His nation crippled by famine, King Kaius I accepted the aid of the Blood of Vol. The Seekers provided undead soldiers and necromantic expertise; with the resources of the crown behind them, Seekers developed necromantic rituals and weapons never before imagined. In exchange, Kaius elevated the Blood of Vol to the official state religion. Warlords were encouraged to embrace the faith, and Seeker families were given lands and titles.",
												"For a time, the Blood of Vol spread and was celebrated\u2014or so it seemed. Most of the old warlord families still despised the Seekers and felt that the use of undead in battle debased the proud martial traditions of their ancestors. Toward the end of the war, Regent Moranna turned on the faith and the Blood of Vol became a scapegoat for all of Karrnath's troubles. Moranna claimed that the famines and plagues the people had suffered were caused by the Seekers. Its nobles were stripped of their lands. Chivalric orders of Seekers were disbanded. Some\u2014notably the infamous Order of the Emerald Claw\u2014refused to surrender, but most Seekers remained loyal to their nation even when it betrayed them.",
												"Today, the Blood of Vol has returned to the shadows, though there are still Seekers who serve the crown. Kaius III has sealed most of his undead forces in the crypts below Korth and Atur, but he isn't willing to entirely surrender this strategic advantage. Fort Bones and Fort Zombie remain bastions of loyal Seekers. But the faith is no longer celebrated, and the old warlord lines still mutter that they would have won the war if only they'd relied on skill and steel instead of foul magics. In playing a Karrnathi Seeker, do you support the crown and believe that Kaius III is only doing what he has to do to maintain the support of the warlords, or do you despise Kaius III and Moranna for betraying your faith?"

The exception is the city of Atur: known as the City of Night, this remains the most public bastion of the Blood of Vol. Expanded and fortified during the Last War, Atur is the seat of Karrnath's necromantic research and development. While Kaius III has stripped the Blood of Vol of much of its standing, he still recognizes its potential value should the war begin anew, and many believe that he continues to provide support to Atur. The mummy lord Hass Malevanor is the high priest of Atur and the current spiritual leader of the faith. However, there are stories of undead champions who have guided and protected the Seekers for centuries. Sometimes known as the Crimson Covenant, these enigmatic figures may be the true power behind Atur.",

As a Seeker hermit, you spent your time in isolation communing with your divinity within, and your Discovery may relate to the faith. Perhaps you have an insight into how to unlock your own power.

But the Talenta were telling their stories before they ever encountered humanity. Though scholars debate the reason why, most agree that the more similar a tradition is to an archetypal Sovereign, the easier it is to draw divine power from that faith. A culture that invokes a deity of the hunt is more likely to produce clerics and paladins than a culture that worships a giant salmon of the same name\u2014and if the deity's name is similar to \"Balinor,\" the connection to divine magic will be easier still. Vassals sages assert that this proves the existence of the Sovereigns, while skeptics say it could simply be a numbers game\u2014it's easier to draw power from a shared belief, and belief in the Sovereigns has reached critical mass.",

Those who follow the Pyrinean Creed may attempt to correct what they see as flawed beliefs, but ultimately, most just smile at the ignorance of the Marcher orc, content in the knowledge that {@i they} know the proper names of the Sovereigns. Likewise, while player characters and NPCs may choose to follow one of the paths described below, you can always develop a unique twist on tradition or introduce a new cult that worships a specific grouping of Sovereigns. This openness is also reflected in Vassal interactions with the Church of the Silver Flame. The Pyrinean Creed asserts that the Sovereigns defeated the overlords at the dawn of time; if the Silver Flame is what keeps the overlords bound, presumably the Sovereigns created it.

The monsters of Droaam also have a quite different view of the Sovereigns and Six, explored in more detail in chapter 4.",

												"The Devourer is the tsunami that overwhelms the tallest ship, the wildfire that consumes the grandest castle, the earthquake that levels the most glorious city. He is the vast and primordial power of nature, a force that will break any chain and wear down the strongest wall. The Devourer is the glorious cruelty that drives the predator, the cry of the hawk and the howl of the wolf. He is all that is wild, savage, and unknowable. He is the deepest ocean, a force that can be crossed but never controlled.",
												"Those who fear the Devourer see him as an entirely destructive force. Arawai is the patron of agriculture, of peacefully harvesting nature's bounty. Balinor is the patron of the hunt, of civilized folk using bow, spear, and skill to challenge or tame the mightiest beasts. These deities reflect the power of civilization to harness and control the natural world, but the Devourer puts the lie to this, showing that nature will never be truly tamed.",
												"Those who embrace the Devourer celebrate the glorious power of the wilds. They revel in the raging storm and gladly embrace their predatory instincts. They accept that nature is often bloody and cruel, and don't hesitate to follow its example. But while it may be harsh, nature is rarely evil. Priests of the Devourer often urge their parishioners to follow their instincts, or teach people to live in accord with nature instead of forcing their will upon it. They may serve as intermediaries, convincing the Devourer to redirect his wrath and spare their followers\u2014or to turn his rage against their enemies."

Instinct is the voice of the Fury, guiding us when rational thought fails. And she is the Sovereign of revenge, promising vengeance to those willing to surrender to her. Her father the Devourer embodies the devastating power of the storm outside us; the Fury is the storm that rages within us, the wild emotions we fight to control.",
												"Devotees of the Fury generally follow one of two paths. Revelers believe that suppressing emotion causes anguish, and that people should embrace their emotions fully and act on impulse and instinct. They hold wild, ecstatic celebrations as a way for participants to throw off the chains of civilization for a moment and experience life and emotion fully. A player character who follows this path might be a Berserker barbarian or a bard using the {@class bard||College of Glamour|glamour|XGE}\u2014either embracing their own primal emotion or inspiring it in others. A sorcerer might attribute their power to wild emotion; they can only access their magic when they let the Fury guide them.",
												"The other path of the Fury is the road of revenge. People who have suffered grievously can call on the Fury to give them the will and strength to take vengeance into their own hands. Or rather than seeking revenge themselves, one tradition calls for someone who has been wronged to place a red candle in a window, inscribed with the name of their tormentor. This is an invitation for the Fury to take vengeance on their behalf. A player character following this path could be charged to investigate and fulfill these calls for revenge. While this could be the path of a cleric or paladin, it could just as easily suit an {@class rogue||Assassin|assassin} rogue, a bard of the {@class bard||College of Whispers|whispers|XGE}, or a warlock."

Beyond guiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also known for his willingness to make deals\u2014though his bargains are always slanted in his favor. Priests known as Talons make these deals on behalf of the Keeper, though the terms are often abstract and driven purely by faith. An entertainer could bargain with a Talon, exchanging ten years of their life for fame; even if the entertainer subsequently becomes famous, there's no way to know if this is the result of the bargain, nor to anticipate when the entertainer might suddenly die. This could easily be a part of the backstory of a player character. Did your entertainer make a bargain with the Keeper?",

These people receive visions of things that the Keeper wishes to add to his hoard; these are usually the souls of specific people, but they could also be artifacts or other unique treasures.

This can be as simple as ambushing an enemy, using stealth instead of facing them openly. Or it can mean slaughtering innocents, torturing your foes, breaking a truce\u2014anything to bring you victory. Those who embrace the path of the Mockery may say that such tactics are the only way to bring down a superior foe. Honor is a luxury for the strong; for those who are weak and oppressed, victory is all that truly matters.",

Pain, terror, and death are the inevitable results of violence; at least those who follow the Mockery acknowledge the truth others deny. The assassin who kills without warning, the barbarian who sees mercy as a weakness, the pirate who cultivates a terrifying reputation\u2014all these might view the Mockery as an ally. While this can be a dark path for a player character to follow, a hero could use the techniques of the Mockery in pursuit of a noble cause.

Both those who fear the Traveler and those who revere it agree on one thing: whatever gifts the Traveler gives, they always lead to chaos. If the Traveler gives you knowledge, it's because the revelation will force you to reevaluate everything you have known.

Guides seek to challenge established traditions, laws, or institutions\u2014not necessarily to destroy them, but to ensure that they haven't outlived their usefulness. Still others are wanderers, embracing a life of constant change. The changeling travelers described in chapter 2 fall into this category, believing that as long as they remain in motion, the Traveler will guide and protect them.

If you're a member of one of these three cults, you don't see the other two as allies, for they're clearly dangerous and delusional. And while outsiders may be able to guess what force is behind the cult\u2014it doesn't take a Korranberg sage to guess that the people growing eyes on their hands might be tied to Belashyrra\u2014only a fraction of the cults of the Dragon Below knowingly serve a daelkyr or overlord.",

Sometimes the delusion infects those who take part in the rituals; other times the ideas first leak into people's minds, then draw them to the cult. This is why the cults of the Dragon Below can never be wiped out, and why they can appear anywhere\u2014you never know when or where an irrational idea can take root, twisting the thoughts and beliefs of innocent people.",
												"While a corrupted cult's beliefs and actions may seem irrational to outsiders, to members of the cult they make perfect sense. A revenant truly believes they are a legendary hero reincarnated. A Vigilant Eye cultist believes they've been given blessed vision that reveals evildoers who must die. The fact the cultist has grown a new eye doesn't seem strange to them\u2014{@i it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.} Corrupted cultists may see the world differently than people around them. A group of revenants could be working with a mind flayer and dolgrims, but they see these aberrations as loyal knights tied to their ancient order. When encountering a corrupted cult, player characters will face the challenge of making sense of the delusion\u2014understanding what the cult members believe they're trying to accomplish, and how it relates to what they're actually doing. These delusions have nothing to do with mental illness and cannot be treated at a Jorasco healing house. This is a form of supernatural influence with a specific cause\u2014a corrupting alien entity\u2014and with a specific effect; corruption can take hold of anyone at any time, and cultists may otherwise appear perfectly healthy and sane.",
												"Corrupted cults rarely last long. They typically come into existence with a clear purpose, a specific scheme that somehow benefits their guiding power. After this scheme succeeds or fails, the driving force often abandons the survivors. The question is whether this releases cultists from the delusion, or whether they are simply abandoned\u2014or even driven toward destructive acts. A second important question is whether it's possible to free a cultist from their delusion while the cult is still active. This could require magic, such as {@spell greater restoration}. But it could simply require the cultist to be isolated from their allies and deprogrammed, or perhaps separated from an item that is reinforcing the delusion. If this powerful delusion can be broken, perhaps the cultist's original identity can reassert itself.",
												"The power behind a corrupted cult isn't always obvious. Loyalists know the power they serve and often proudly proclaim it, but many other corrupted cults aren't aware of the power behind them. Vigilant Eye cultists could mistakenly believe that their blessed eyes are a gift from Aureon, while a revenant might believe Dol Arrah has returned them to the world. Even if the cultists themselves don't realize who they serve, the trappings can be a giveaway. Belashyrra's cultists often deal with eyes or beholders, Dyrrn employs illithids and doppelgangers, and Kyrzin's cults usually have something to do with oozes and slime.

As a result, transactional cults often begin as secret societies. People join of their own free will, eager to obtain whatever it is the cult has to offer. But even if someone joins for the most rational of reasons, the influence of a daelkyr or an overlord is difficult to resist; the longer someone remains in the cult, the more power it will have over them.",

A wizard has a fascinating conversation with a colleague, discussing a spell unlike anything they've seen before. The colleague explains that the spell is from Ashtakala's vaults, and if the wizard joins the Court, they'll discover many amazing things about magic and history. So they go to a meeting and are impressed by the scholars and warlocks they meet. Soon they're initiated into the cult, swearing an oath to the Queen of Shadows and being invested as the Knight of the Forgotten Library. It seems like a game, and they're gaining access to fascinating new spells. But as time passes, they become ever more obsessed with rising in the Court of Shadows. The political interplay in the Kingdom of Shadows feels more real, more relevant than the mundane politics of Khorvaire. They pursue missions for the Queen, yearning to win her favor. And they hope that someday the Queen will rise from her slumber, for then, the Kingdom of Shadows will truly become real.",

Often, members of transactional cults know who they are dealing with, but greed or curiosity overrides concerns.

But beyond the loyalists, cult goals can be a little more exotic.",
										"Corrupted cults usually have some sort of immediate goal that drives the formation and expansion of the cult. {@i The Vigilant Eye is hunting down \"demons\" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!} The goals are often terrible things that must be stopped, but it's not always obvious how they are helping the power behind the cult; these schemes may have nothing to do with the seals of the daelkyr or releasing an overlord. In the case of an overlord, the archfiends gain strength by driving mortals down their paths. For {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, getting mortals to use magic for malevolence strengthens her regardless of what they actually do; likewise, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} revels in all violence. Meanwhile, the daelkyr are truly incomprehensible. They certainly enjoy experimenting with their preferred mediums; one of {@creature dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn's} cults could enact a ritual that causes dragonmarks to come to life and attack their bearers, with no purpose beyond satisfying Dyrrn's curiosity. As the daelkyr experience time in a nonlinear fashion, it's also possible that what seems like meaningless chaos could have a unforeseen future\u2014that there will come a time when a living dragonmark unleashed in the cult's bizarre rampage ends up being the vital element needed to defeat one of the Lords of Dust. The key point is that cults of the Dragon Below\u2014particularly corrupted cults\u2014may not have long-term plans; their schemes can and should often appear nonsensical.",
										"Traditional cults are religions. They aren't driven by short term goals, but instead provide guidelines on how to live your whole life. Traditional cults can be peaceful and innocuous... until they aren't. A particular alignment of moons, a vision sent to the cult leader, a critical mass of outsiders arriving at the same time\u2014any cult could have a set of circumstances that trigger bloody rituals or brutal sacrifices. This is where the absurdity of a traditional cult rises to the surface.

										"Transactional cults are often initially driven by the desires of the members. Someone joins a transactional cult because they want the power to do something\u2014to take revenge on their enemies, to overthrow a tyrant, to destroy a local criminal gang.

										"Each cult of the Dragon Below is tied to a sinister power trapped in Khyber, and a cult's goals usually reflect the power behind it. If the cult has inhuman allies, are they fiends, aberrations, or other monsters? What sort of treasures and magic items does the group use? These magic items aren't necessarily direct gifts from the patron; a cult of Kyrzin may have many potions because the high priest is an alchemist, or because a strange fountain in the temple secretes mystical fluids. In the case of loyalists and traditional cults, the connection to its patron may be quite obvious, whereas corrupted cults can be challenging to identify the hidden manipulator. Regardless of whether cultists know the identity of their patron, the power behind a cult has many effects.",
										"As a broad rule, cults tied to overlords (Rak Tulkhesh, Sul Khatesh, Katashka, Bel Shalor, the Daughter of Khyber) are either directly helping the Lords of Dust or trying to drive behavior that strengthens the archfiend. The daelkyr (Belashyrra, Dyrrn, Kyrzin, Orlaask, Valaara) are more enigmatic. Their traditional cults may continue strange patterns of behavior handed down for generations, performing sacrifices or mysterious rituals when the planes are aligned. But they can also engage in dramatic actions with no clear benefit to anyone. There's no clear reason for Orlassk to turn citizens of Sharn into gargoyles; it could be an experiment, or simply a form of art. But these actions will be related to the sphere of the daelkyr that causes it, whether that's oozes, stone, eyes, or insects.",

Phthaso Mogan of Sharn has written a treatise in which he describes a man who performed miracles based on his fanatical devotion to his own shoe. Mogan concluded that the man was actually receiving his power from Kol Korran, the Sovereign of Travel. But while it's possible to draw spells from worshiping a shoe, this would be extremely rare. Though the cause is debated, scholars recognize that the more similar your target of worship is to an archetypal Sovereign, the more likely you are to be granted divine magic. And thus, over the ages, civilizations have gravitated toward worshiping a variation of the Sovereign Host.",

Korranberg scholar Dravo Den Talas has proposed an alternate theory: that if there is any truth to the beliefs of the Blood of Vol, {@i all} divine magic could be drawn from the mystic spark of the caster. According to Talas, the actual belief is irrelevant; it is purely the strength of faith that matters.",

In the Graywall Mountains, a set of thousand-foot statues commemorate the six kings who came together to form the ancient Empire of Dhakaan. But while this region may have once been important to the dar, it was utterly devastated in their war against the daelkyr, compounded by the return of forces long held at bay by the empire. Vicious gnolls swarmed south from the Towering Wood. Fierce orcs emerged from the western swamp. Trolls and ogres came down from the mountains. Those dar that remained were infected with daelkyr curses; instead of standing together against the invaders, they turned on each other, and centuries of chaos and bloodshed followed. By the time it was done, all that remained of Dhakaan was ruins. Hobgoblins and bugbears had been eradicated in the region, and goblins were scattered and divided.",
												"The region was dominated by anarchy from then on\u2014some believe this merely follows the natural instincts of the region's inhabitants, while others point to the lingering influence of the daelkyr. There were a few bastions of civilization\u2014the Venomous Demesne, the hidden village of Lost\u2014but the people of these communities had no interest in expanding their culture; they were either fortified, hidden from the outside world, or both. Across the rest of the Barrens, history was marked by the rise and fall of countless mighty chibs. Chib is a Goblin term sometimes translated as \"chieftain,\" but it literally means \"boss\" or \"big person\"\u2014and in the Barrens, the chib was often just the biggest creature around. Typically a band would form around an ogre, ettin, or troll\u2014a creature powerful enough to assert their will over goblins, kobolds, or lesser creatures of their own kind. But while powerful, these creatures lacked the ambition or drive to build anything that could last. Occasionally a more intelligent leader\u2014a minotaur warlord, a charismatic oni\u2014would build a greater force, perhaps even establish a dynasty that would last a generation or two before being overwhelmed by the relentless, brutal tide."

Wise creatures knew to avoid the Watching Woods, home to worgs and worse. In the plains, the strongest leader was the minotaur warlord Rhesh Toraa; around her keep, countless minor chibs fought one another more frequently than they struck the settlers.",
												"The first days of the Last War led to a reduction of forces in the west of Breland; while it was a violent, unstable region, there were few settlers across the Graywall needing protection. Not all of the Westwind Riders were Brelish, and with Wroaan's coronation, soldiers returned to serve their home nations, and Wroaan needed all the troops she could muster. She reduced the Westwind Riders to a minimal force\u2014enough to patrol between the fortresses of Orcbone and Stubborn, but little more.",
												"Many Aundairians had been part of the Westwind Riders, and on receiving their reports, Spy Master ir'Galanatyr saw an opportunity. The Royal Eyes of Aundair worked with Rhesh Toraa and other chibs in the Barrens, providing equipment and training to support attacks against Graywall settlers and raids across the gap. With forces tied up to the east, it was up to the commanders of Orcbone and Stubborn to protect the west. But ultimately, the provocateurs from Aundair and Karrnath found the Barrens raiders undisciplined and impossible to unify, never posing the dire threat Breland's enemies had hoped for."

												"The fortress-town of Stubborn survived decades of raids and skirmishes, as the chibs of the Barrens had no patience for sieges and no weapons for breaking strong walls. Many lesser settlements and claims were overrun and lost, but Stubborn repelled countless attacks by goblins and minotaurs. However, it was utterly unprepared for the force that struck it in the last decade of the war. A typical band of raiders might include a single troll or a handful of ogres, but in 986 YK, the soldiers of Stubborn found themselves facing phalanxes of armored trolls fighting with deadly skill, and squads of ogres acting with discipline and coordination. Stubborn's defenders leapt off the walls in pursuit of harpies' songs, and the walls were shattered by hurled stones. Survivors were herded into the plains to face the leaders of the army; this was the first recorded encounter with the assembled Daughters of Sora Kell, three enigmatic hags discussed in depth later in this chapter.",
												"\"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west,\" Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. \"What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.\"",
												"Once news of the fall of Stubborn reached Orcbone, the Westwind Riders traveled west in full force. But Sora Katra was true to her word; there were no survivors, nor any records of the last battle of the Westward Riders. A retaliatory strike from Droaam\u2014merely a fraction of the forces at Stubborn\u2014inflicted terrible damage on Orcbone itself. King Boranel swiftly deployed all the soldiers he could spare to this new front, reinforcing and fortifying Orcbone. In 987 YK, he formally ordered all Brelish citizens to withdraw from the lands west of Graywall, but he refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Daughters, and over the next decade, clashes continued."

												"To the people to the east of the Graywall Mountains, it seemed that the Daughters of Sora Kell appeared out of nowhere\u2014and it felt much the same to the chibs of the Barrens. But evidence suggests that it was the culmination of years, or even decades, of planning. How long did it take to train the trolls and ogres now known as Maenya's Fist? How did the Daughters acquire the armor and weapons wielded by this force? Some say that Sora Maenya assembled her troops in a forgotten Dhakaani fortress deep below the Byeshk Mountains, and that she oversaw the forging of their weapons in this ancient foundry. Sora Maenya calls the soldiers of Maenya's Fist her children, and some scholars believe this might be literally true; both her war trolls and skullcrusher ogres are smarter and more capable than their common cousins. But how long would such an endeavor take? Melian Mit Davandi of the Library of Korranberg has advanced the theory that demiplanes may have been involved\u2014that Maenya's lair in Khyber could exist outside of the normal flow of time, allowing the schemes of the Daughters to be both a recent development and the work of generations. Sora Teraza approached the Queen of Stone and the lords of the Venomous Demesne in 985 YK, and the Daughters brokered the services of fully half of the Znir Pact mercenaries in this time. No one knows just how long the Daughters spent in preparation\u2014but 986 YK is when they made their presence known.",
												"Leading up to the attack on Stubborn, the Daughters spoke with\u2014and dominated\u2014the greatest powers of the Barrens. The chibs of the plains only understood force, and the Daughters displayed it; the scattered bands of raiders were forced to submit, and those who refused to bow to the Daughters of Sora Kell were executed in gruesome ways.",
												"In 987 YK the Daughters of Sora Kell summoned the region's most powerful leaders to the ruins now known as the Great Crag. There, Sora Katra presented the blueprint for the new nation, appointing warlords and specifying their responsibilities and regions. Work began on the greatest cities of this new nation: Graywall, the Great Crag, and the port city of Vralkek. The old fortress of Stubborn was repurposed and renamed Stonejaw. While some of the raider bands were left to follow their old ways, many were absorbed into the new nation. Thousands of goblins and kobolds were freed from their oppressive chibs and given opportunities in the new cities. This new order was maintained by gnoll peacekeepers of the Znir Pact. When that proved insufficient\u2014when a chib refused to release their captive subjects or defied the Daughters\u2014Maenya's Fist would descend to destroy them. The message was simple: Change was coming. You could find your place in Droaam, or you could choose obliteration.",
												"The Daughters' ambitious plans were strengthened by an alliance with House Tharashk. For Tharashk, this provided access to the rich mineral resources of Droaam and the services of monstrous mercenaries, which opened an entirely new path for the house. For the Daughters, it tied them to a force with a legitimate voice and influence in the East. Tharashk agents convinced the Twelve to open up trade to Droaam\u2014at least to the new city of Graywall. The house helped to organize laborers and build the new cities. Through Tharashk, the denizens of Droaam began to appear throughout the Five Nations, though tensions continued in the vicinity of Orcbone. Gargoyles and harpy couriers found a niche in Sharn. Ogre laborers could be found in Fairhaven and Wroat. In Sharn, the Gargoyle replaced the Bat in the Race of Eight Winds. Today, many citizens of the Five Nations are still uncomfortable around these creatures, but their presence is slowly becoming less remarkable."

										"While all citizens of Droaam serve the Daughters of Sora Kell, each region is independently governed by a warlord in the name of the Daughters, and beneath them, chibs rule local communities. All citizens are expected to serve their nation when called upon, and to do whatever is asked of them. In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride\u2014driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. \"Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still. But look what we've done in one decade, and imagine what we'll achieve in the next!\"",
										"Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs\u2014miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there's much change yet to come.",
										"While many outsiders may think Droaam's system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist\u2014ground meat made of troll flesh\u2014that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder\u2014the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds.

However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.",
												"When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.",
												"Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common\u2014and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.",
												"Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.",
												"While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in {@i muut} or {@i atcha}, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms {@i chaat'oor} or {@i gath'dar} to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use {@i aravaat}\u2014easterner\u2014to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it."

As it stands, Droaam has been split into {@i lheshat}\u2014a Goblin term meaning \"domain of a warlord.\" Each lheshat is governed by a warlord who answers directly to the Daughters; each is charged with maintaining a military force that can serve the Daughters.",
												"For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city\u2014though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent. Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse\u2014foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.",

Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.",

												"Droaam isn't bound by the Code of Galifar, and there is no uniform code of justice. Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.",
												"Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers\u2014anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall\u2014but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.",
												"In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.",
												"There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it\u2014but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice\u2014but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.",
												"Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor'chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.",
												"A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; {@i everyone} clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her\u2014he needs to know better\u2014but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters."

Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted.

												"Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth\u2014so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage\u2014\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"\u2014adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam\u2014or is perhaps even an ally\u2014there won't be a bounty on its teeth.",
												"While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter\u2014any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.",
												"Droaam's main exports\u2014brokered through House Tharashk\u2014are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!",
												"In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the {@table Droaamish Artisanship|ExploringEberron} table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations.

As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.",
												"Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find {@i your} path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species\u2014from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.",
												"All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.",
												"Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.",
												"There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam\u2014the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone."

This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.",

The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the \"grist mills\" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish\u2014for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.",
												"Every major town has a \"grist mill\"\u2014a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate\u2014though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily\u2014stew, sausage, meat broth\u2014but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew\u2014there's plenty more where it came from!",
												"For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland."

In general, the people of Droaam are quite comfortable with the presence of large predators, and it's polite to say {@i ta kuur}\u2014You speak?\u2014to a beast you've never met before.",

Under the rules of fifth edition, all lycanthropes can spread the curse, but the Daughters and Zaeurl both wish to avoid spreading lycanthropy\u2014at least for the moment. The Dark Pack follows strict instructions\u2014{@i don't bite unless you intend to kill.} As with trolls, most town guards understand this rule; if your friend picks a fight with a werewolf, sorry, it has to kill them after biting them; that's just a matter of public safety. Sora Katra is studying the curse of lycanthropy and may develop ways to prevent accidental contagion... or instead, she might develop a program of carefully managed infection to create a new corps of lycanthrope soldiers."

										"The destruction of Stubborn and the declaration of Droaam came as a terrible shock to the people of the Five Nations. This wasn't the work of an upstart prince or an ogre chieftain. Both Sora Katra and Sora Maenya were known from countless tales\u2014mostly terrifying ones in which things don't end well for the heroes. To most people, the Daughters were legends, figures used to scare unruly children. The Daughters were the reason you were afraid of the darkness as a child; Sora Maenya could be lurking in the shadows, waiting to add your skull to her collection. Most people of the Five Nations know nothing of the daelkyr or of the Dreaming Dark, but they know the Daughters of Sora Kell. This is one reason the Five Nations have refused to acknowledge Droaam; at the end of the day, they can't believe that it is real, and they hope that maybe they'll wake up tomorrow and realize it was all just a bad dream.",
										"In principle, the Daughters of Sora Kell are hags. Sora Katra is a green hag, cunning and charismatic. Sora Maenya is an annis hag, possessed of tremendous strength and hunger. And Sora Teraza is a dusk hag, who sees the tapestry of the future laid out before her. However, calling Sora Katra a green hag is like calling a legendary bard a \"human.\" It's a foundation\u2014a basic archetype to begin with. But all of the Daughters possess powers far beyond what's normal for hags of their type. Their mother was Sora Kell, one of thirteen immortal night hags said to have been created by Eberron and Khyber at the dawn of time. Each had a different father; in some stories these were fiends, in others, giants. Regardless, they possess inherited power, which has only increased over centuries of schemes and adventures. While the Daughters are usually spoken of together, each is a legend in her own right; they each have their own goals and distinct personality, and each one can offer different hooks for story or adventure.",

												"The stories of Sora Katra are many and varied, for she's a gifted shapeshifter who seems to love meddling in the lives of heroes. She's the old woman at the inn whose idle comment sows doubt in lovers' hearts. She's the tinker who gives the farmboy the magic sword that helps him become king\u2014the same blade he uses to kill himself in the final act. It's only through a wink to the audience or a hint to the reader that Katra's true identity is revealed. In some ways, this fictive role overlaps with that of the Traveler, but the gifts of the Traveler bring chaos, while those of Sora Katra inevitably bring {@i tragedy.}",
												"However, Sora Katra isn't always the villain in tales. When she acts openly, she often poses a challenge that tests the hero's wits or resolve. In most of these tales, the champion fails the challenge\u2014which is, to be fair, usually weighted against them\u2014and disaster ensues. But in those rare cases where the protagonist remains true to their ideals or outwits the hag, she always holds true to her promises. It's this penchant for testing resolve and punishing failings that gave birth to the popular tale that if a child makes a promise and breaks their word, Sora Katra will come in the night and take a finger from them.",
												"Sora Katra is known as a schemer. In many stories she's found weaving curses on her loom\u2014plotting misery and misfortunes to release into the world. In the tale {@i The Sleeping Prince}, she curses the Prince of Wroat three days after his birth. In the end of the story, the Woodcutter's Daughter kills the giant in the King's Forest and gives Katra his tongue, and when the curse is lifted, the Woodcutter's Daughter marries the prince. Scholars have long debated Katra's motives in the tale. Is it that she couldn't kill the giant, and was setting a scheme in motion that would lead to his downfall? Or was it actually her goal from the start to elevate the Woodcutter's Daughter\u2014did she create the obstacle in order to give her chosen hero a chance to rise? While this is a positive spin, there's no question that Katra's actions always bring misfortune to {@i someone}\u2014especially those who fail to measure up to her challenges.",
												"Sora Katra is a brilliant orator. In the stories, she usually uses her words to sow doubt or discord, but she is equally capable of binding people together and weaving dreams of glory. In Droaam, she is the voice of the Daughters, and her speeches have drawn a dozen different species together, and made raiders and brigands believe that they are part of something greater and grander than they ever imagined. In part, this is about playing on the peoples' anger and fear of the easterners. But she also has a knack for simply knowing what people want\u2014such as the ambitions of her warlords\u2014and using that to her advantage. Combined with the guidance of Teraza, she foresees problems and invariably finds someone to take the fall for things that cannot be avoided. In some ways, this is the central mystery of Droaam: Why found a nation to begin with? And why seek to be recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, when Teraza most likely knew the effort would fail? One possibility is that the entire nation is just a stepping-stone toward her true goal\u2014just as the prince in {@i The Sleeping Prince} was a tool that ultimately elevated the Woodcutter's Daughter. It's possible Droaam is another of her tests\u2014but who's being tested, and what happens if they fail? What about the criminal organization Daask? Is this just a diversion for Katra, or is Daask advancing a mysterious agenda?",
												"In her natural form, the Mistress of the Mires is a green hag, with green skin and dark green hair. However, she loves illusion and rarely remains in her true form. If she has no reason to remain in a particular form, she often shifts in mid-speech. She delights in forms with a personal impact on the people she's dealing with\u2014taking the face of a dead lover or a betrayed friend. She possesses abilities like a powerful bard, both the ability to inspire and to perform powerful enchantments and illusions.",
												"Sora Katra loves challenging heroes, which makes it easy to tie her to a story. Perhaps Droaam itself has been created to test the player characters\u2014she's spent a decade and built a nation to force the characters to make a difficult decision. If you want to create a connection between Katra and a character, is the character the archetypal Sleeping Prince\u2014who Katra torments, seemingly without reason\u2014or are they the Woodcutter's Daughter, who may be challenged but has a chance to come out ahead in the end? Consider also the tale of the farmer who became a king. Katra might give a character an artifact, seemingly for no reason; can they use it wisely, or will it lead them to despair? While a connection to Katra could develop during play, you could establish a tie to the Mistress of the Mires in a character's backstory. Perhaps Katra cursed the character's family because of something their parents did; is there something the character can do to lift the curse? Or perhaps the character unwittingly did a favor for a disguised Katra back when they were a child, and she promised to repay this act of kindness; when and how will the character call in this favor?"

												"Sora Maenya is often depicted as a monster, said to wander the Towering Wood. She is known for her strength and her endless appetite; it's commonly said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then eat the whole thing and still be hungry. Stories often depict her through her absence, as an unstoppable force that punishes arrogance or cruelty. The shepherd warns the foolish farmers not to settle in the forbidden meadow; later, he returns to find their bones picked clean and stacked near the hearth, but without their skulls. There's no need to say who it was or to show the battle. The tale notes the missing skulls, and everyone knows that Maenya keeps the skulls of her victims, binding their souls to the bone and using them as lanterns.",
												"Maenya greatly enjoys games and challenges, and she may spare someone who shows spirit. While she doesn't lay out schemes as complex as does Sora Katra, there are many tales of Maenya wandering the woods in disguise and tricking travelers into unwise contests. Her endless appetite reflects a broad love of life; it's not simply that she's hungry, it's that she loves to eat. She fights for the sheer joy that comes in crushing an enemy, and in the folk song {@i Edar's Last Jig}, she dances until her partner dies of exhaustion. She seems to have a sense of humor, albeit a morbid one; she may spare someone who makes her laugh, or let someone live because it amuses her to do so. There are stories where a hero beats her in a seemingly impossible contest through cunning and courage; when defeated, she honors any promise she has made. However, a victor would be wise not to gloat; in the tales, this is a sure path to an unexpected end.",
												"Sora Maenya is the general of Droaam's armies, the iron fist that crushes any rebellion. The core of her power is Maenya's Fist, an elite corps of war trolls and skullcrusher ogres. Everything about the Fist is shrouded in mystery. Some say Maenya bred and trained them in a buried Dhakaani fortress; others say that Maenya herself forged the imposing plate armor that they wear. Whatever the truth, the members of the Fist are fanatically devoted to Maenya. While Droaam has yet to assemble an army combining the full force of its warlords, thus far, Maenya has shown herself to be a brilliant and unorthodox strategist, one not to be underestimated.",
												"In her natural form, Sora Maenya is an annis hag\u2014a towering, powerful figure. She can assume smaller forms, but rarely seeks to play psychological games with her shapeshifting as Katra does. She appears in many tales as a hungry woman\u2014tall and thin, with ragged clothing and long black hair, seeking shelter and food. While her primary power is her martial might, she does have supernatural gifts; the most infamous is her soulbinding. And perhaps she also has other necromantic skills that haven't been revealed in the tales...",
												"While she's known for her immense strength, Sora Maenya isn't just a brute; there are stories in which she actually trains a hero, either teaching them to fight or granting them unnatural strength. While it would be an unusual path, a monk or barbarian could attribute their class features to early training with Sora Maenya. The question is whether they knew her identity when she taught them; was she the Reaver of the Woods, or did she teach them in an assumed form? If a character is from the Eldeen Reaches, might they have met Sora Maenya as a child? Perhaps they ran away from home, and Maenya devoured their village while they were away. Or maybe they made an unwise bargain\u2014asking Sora Maenya to kill a childhood rival, which she did; now the character owes her a debt, and someday she'll come to collect. Or perhaps it's the other way around; perhaps as a child, the character defeated Maenya at a game, and it's she who owes the character a favor."

												"One thing that makes the Daughters interesting is that they aren't simply mundane tyrants or warlords. They're legends, and have matched wits with countless heroes. One way to reflect this is to provide them with powers that aren't easily represented or replicated by the standard rules of play. For example, when a character is negotiating with Sora Katra, the DM might ask the player, \"Tell me a time in your childhood when you broke a promise.\" Sora Katra might then bring that story up: \"I watched you through your window that night, warrior. I chose not to take your finger then, for I'd had my fill that evening. But why should I trust you today, when you broke your word to your childhood friend?\"",
												"There's no saving throw against this and no mechanical effect. It simply demonstrates that Katra has powers and influence that can't be measured or fully defined. Perhaps she's using some form of telepathy and the whole thing's a con. Or perhaps she was there that night. The point is that she's not just a powerful bard; no one knows exactly what she can do. Likewise with Teraza's visions, or the idea that Katra can weave curses on her loom\u2014like eldritch machines, the limit on these abilities is whatever the story needs them to be.",
												"In many ways, the Daughters feel like characters pulled out of faerie tales, and the DM could draw inspiration from elements of Thelanis from chapter 5 (such as curses). But the Daughters are natives of Eberron, not archfey from Thelanis. As such, the Daughters are extremely powerful and long-lived, but they're ultimately mortal; they should be very difficult to kill, but they can die. In addition, archfey largely cannot change, and continue to play out the same story indefinitely. The Daughters are part of Eberron, and as shown by Droaam itself, they may have their preferred themes, but they can create entirely new stories."

She's known to be blind, yet she's perfectly aware of her surroundings; it's not that she can see, she simply {@i knows} where everything is. In some tales, it's said that she knows when every individual will die; in other stories, she herself chooses when each person will die. It's also said that she has a library in which she keeps books documenting the lives of remarkable people\u2014books that contain the souls of those heroes, and that she appears to collect the soul when that champion is near death.",
												"Sora Teraza is a dusk hag. While she can change her shape, she rarely does so; she wears an old, tattered robe and hides her face beneath a deep hood. She rarely speaks, other than to issue cryptic pronouncements. When she's not with her sisters, she spends her time tending her library in the Great Crag, or in meditation. Teraza is certainly the most gifted oracle of the age. This may be connected to the Draconic Prophecy, or it may be that she perceives the future in a different way. Certainly, Teraza is never depicted as having to seek her answers; it seems she just knows them. Given this unerring knowledge, it would seem like it should be impossible for the Daughters to ever fail; she can reveal the plans of their enemies and the location of any treasure they might seek. But Teraza doesn't always share her knowledge, act in the best interests of her sisters, or even her own interests. Why not? The simplest answer is that she is unhinged; any mind could be broken by the burden of such knowledge. A more complicated possibility is that she is trapped by her own knowledge\u2014that she already knows what she is going to do, and doesn't actually have any real free will. Or perhaps her knowledge isn't as absolute as it appears: she has the potential to know anything, but some things simply evade her sight.",
												"Regardless, Sora Teraza certainly can, and sometimes does, warn her sisters about possible threats, such as treacherous warlords or approaching player characters, and directs them to the best path to ensure victory. But she can also remain silent, or only offer information later than others consider helpful. For example, she could reveal that there's an Aundairian war criminal\u2014a wizard of tremendous skill, who Sora Katra would surely have a use for\u2014hiding out in Graywall. But she might provide this information a year after his arrival, and only a day before he plans to depart\u2014leaving Katra with just 24 hours to mobilize agents to try and capture the wizard. Will these agents compete with the player characters, or will they be the player characters? Teraza might also provide a character with a mysterious piece of information\u2014via {@spell dream} or {@spell sending}\u2014that could be very useful, even if it could hurt her sisters. This doesn't mean she is betraying her sisters; it is simply that she does what she must do, when she must do it. While Sora Teraza's knowledge is potentially limitless, in practice, it's a tool to drive an interesting story, not to derail it."

										"There have always been gnoll clans in the Barrens, though the Dhakaani goblins ruthlessly exterminated gnolls in imperial territories, driving them back into the wilds. But their story starts long before. In the dawn of time, Eberron was the domain of the fiendish overlords. This was an age of chaos, as the overlords constantly clashed with one another. {@creature Rak Tulkesh|ERLW}, the Rage of War, commanded armies of fiends, while the Wild Heart raised hordes of ravenous beasts. In the struggles between the two, the Wild Heart bred dire hyenas with the ability to consume the immortal essences of the Zakya warriors of Rak Tulkhesh. But the Wild Heart failed to anticipate how consuming fiends would affect its creations. Twisted from within by the immortal essence of the demons they'd devoured, the hyenas were warped into something entirely new, something that was neither beast nor demon: and so the first gnolls were born.",
										"Formed from both War and the Wild, gnolls were recruited and bred by both Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. As foot soldiers of the overlords, they fought against orcs and other early humanoids, as well as battling the gnoll clans of other overlords. Even after the overlords were defeated and bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to be their pawns. The fiendish spark burned within them, and when they weren't directly serving the Lords of Dust, most engaged in vicious acts of brutality. The Rage of War seeks endless battle, and when there is no greater conflict, it delights in setting its minions against one another. For countless generations, gnolls fought troll, ogre, and other gnolls seeking blood for their hungry idols.",
										"Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin\u2014then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as {@i Znir}\u2014a word that simply means \"stone\"\u2014and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one\u2014not chib, god, or demon\u2014to hold dominion over them.",
										"This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even just holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all of the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact.",
										"Some scholars of the Five Nations find it strange that the Znir Pact never took the path of conquest. There was no parallel to the united force of the Pact within the region, and they could have defeated the various chibs and warlords they served. But the gnolls have never had a desire to rule other creatures; they love the hunt and the thrill of battle. The path of the Pact allows them to do what comes naturally\u2014to stalk and kill, to fight endless battles\u2014but they do so together. They choose the paths they follow and the battles they fight. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.",

Time and again, the six kings clashed on the field of battle, but the kings were matched in cunning and their warriors were equals in courage and skill. No victory could be won, and no compromise could be found. Jhazaal Dhakaan called the six kings together, and none could resist her summons. She brought them to a field soaked with blood and strewn with blunted blades.",

They fought the great Corruptor and brought him down, but even as he fell, he whispered to the hero who defeated him.

										"Little is known of the origins of the goblinoid species. Aereni records describe warring goblinoids on Khorvaire around forty thousand years ago, when the elves settled on Aerenal. But recent studies suggest that the goblinoids themselves appeared quite suddenly around this time. It's commonly believed that the goblinoids evolved in vast caverns below the surface, but some modern scholars hold competing theories. Kel Kador of the Library of Korranberg believes that the goblinoid subspecies were magebred from a common ancestor, and that this goblin progenitor might still be found underground. Hass Holan of Morgrave University has advanced a more exotic theory\u2014that the goblinoids may have emerged from a demiplane within Khyber, from a warlike realm that has yet to be found. The goblins themselves have little interest in the origins of the {@i dar}\u2014a Goblin word meaning \"the people.\" For them, the history of Dhakaan is the history of the dar. The two are considered synonymous, and regardless of their origins, the Dhakaani culture emerged approximately sixteen thousand years ago.",
										"The legend that opens this section deals with the roots of the Empire of Dhakaan, when six hobgoblin kings fought over ancient Khorvaire. Jhazaal Dhakaan was the greatest duur'kala bard of the age and the artifacts she crafted are testament to her remarkable power; the warhorn {@i Ghaal'duur} in chapter 7 is one of her creations. If the legend is to be believed, Jhazaal Dhakaan performed a feat of epic magic. She crafted the dream of an empire and bound the goblinoids of the time to this dream. This {@i Uul Dhakaan}\u2014Dream of Dhakaan\u2014gave the ancient goblins oneness of culture and purpose, uniting them under Jhazaal Dhakaan as the first {@i marhu}\u2014emperor of Dhakaan. The Dhakaani empire spread across Khorvaire, pushing the dwarves back into the depths of Khyber and driving the dragonborn into the eastern jungles. The Dhakaani repelled Tairnadal colonists, and drove orcs, gnolls, and other minor cultures into the wild frontiers.",
										"The golden age of Dhakaan lasted over five millennia, with goblins ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by Galifar. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with the Xoriat incursion, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations into Khorvaire. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and transformed goblinoids into aberrations, such as dolgaunts and dolgrims. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions turned the tide. The orc Gatekeeper druids bound the daelkyr in Khyber, but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies and hunted down the beasts that survived. But as legend tells, the daelkyr achieved victory even in defeat. Dyrrn the Corruptor created a psychic contagion that severed goblinoids from the Uul Dhakaan, and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational beliefs. Leaders among the {@i duur'kala}\u2014dirge singers looked to for wisdom and guidance\u2014identified the threat but couldn't find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the {@i Kapaa'vola}\u2014the Treacherous Whisper\u2014had faded. These armies called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}, Keepers of the Empire\u2014a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.",
										"On the surface, the remnants of the empire fragmented and collapsed. As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned, the history of the Empire of Dhakaan came to an end the moment Dyrrn the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa'vola. But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the Keepers left; the wider world doesn't even know the term Kapaa'vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn's curse caused paranoia and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost, and the traditions of the daashor\u2014artificers of Dhakaan\u2014and the duur'kala were forgotten. New religions and cults emerged. Some tribes embraced the Dark Six, while others revered a wider pantheon. Under Dhakaan, the goblinoid subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa'vola, the strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral. When human explorers found these warring tribes living in the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they destroyed. This false narrative was used to justify countless atrocities. Humanity slowly displaced the goblinoids, seizing the lands that once belonged to Dhakaan. Goblins were often subjugated, while bugbears and hobgoblins were driven into the wilds or the upper levels of Khyber. In time scholars learned the truth\u2014that the foundations they'd built upon were goblin cities, not human. But few people cared; in their eyes, the goblinoids were merely savages, children of the Dark Six, dangerous and cruel. It was in this time that the terms {@i goblin, bugbear,} and {@i hobgoblin} took root, even among the former dar themselves.",
										"The oppression of goblins persisted for more than a thousand years, while bugbears and hobgoblins remained hostile forces in the fringes, dwelling in the wild lands ignored by humanity. When Galifar Wynarn began his conquest of the Five Nations, he promised freedom to any goblin who fought under his banner, Goblin soldiers played a vital role in the war that followed, and Galifar remained true to his word. Despite this freedom, goblins were still often treated with prejudice and suspicion, and denied education and other tools for success. Even today, goblins can be found in every major city of the Five Nations, but an overwhelming number live in poverty.",
										"In the shadow of Galifar, goblinoid cultures continued to develop and evolve. The most widespread were the Ghaal'dar tribes of the Seawall Mountains. While they remained severed from the Uul Dhakaan and knew nothing of the hidden Keepers, the Ghaal'dar recovered scraps of their ancient history. The hobgoblins pursued {@i muut} and {@i atcha}\u2014their duty to their people and their personal honor\u2014though they knew these only as abstract concepts. They honed their anger against the {@i chaat'oor}\u2013the non-native defilers\u2014who had stolen their ancient lands. Some of the Ghaal'dar tribes served as mercenaries during the Last War, learning more about the chaat'oor in the process.",
										"And then in 969 YK, chieftain Haruuc of the Rhukaan Taash led the uprising that claimed the lands of southern Cyre and founded the nation known as Darguun. Little did he know that other eyes were watching. Khesh'dar scouts and spies had been gathering information on the world above since the beginning of the Last War. The founding of Darguun made it even easier for the Silent Folk to move within the world. The duur'kala of the Kech Dhakaan concluded that the Kapaa'vola had faded; these Ghaal'dar might be victims of the daelkyr curse, but associating with them posed no threat to the Uul Dhakaan.

Muut is typically translated as \"duty,\" though it can also be seen as \"the honor of the empire\"\u2014something everyone must work to maintain. Muut is what is expected of you, what you owe to your comrades. Dhakaani don't expect thanks for doing something that has to be done; rather, they are disgusted by those who shirk their responsibilities. The closest dar equivalent to \"thank you\" is {@i ta muut,} which simply means, \"You do your duty.\"",

No dar is content to simply do what is expected; the quest for atcha is a powerful driving force that urges dar to chase their full potential. In battle, the exhortation {@i paatcha} means, \"This is a chance to gain honor!\"",

At the same time, they yearn to attain atcha\u2014to exceed expectations, to do deeds that will be remembered by those who follow you. The deep role of muut and atcha is shaped both by childhood training, by daily life, and further by the Uul Dhakaan. So while Dhakaani have personal desires and ambitions, muut should always come first.",

The Dhakaani prize victory and efficiency, both on and off the battlefield. Atcha comes from standing your ground against seemingly impossible odds and from displaying skill and discipline. There is honor in using cunning to defeat a superior foe, so guerilla warfare, ambushing a foe, and even assassination are acceptable tactics, if this is what muut requires. Dar must be ready to die for the empire\u2014but when possible, it's always better to kill for the empire.

Now that the Dhakaani have returned to the surface, resources are more plentiful and life is less austere. However, thousands of years of strict tradition remain in place.",

The goblin who cleans the latrines is serving the demands of muut as fully as a formidable hobgoblin warlord. The ghaal'dar lead because they are natural leaders. The guul'dar use their strength for the greater good. These things are simply {@i understood}, and the ghaal'dar don't have to use force to enforce their rule.",

The Kech Dhakaan have different views on the future course of the empire, and each kech hopes to fill the throne. But they recognize that they are few against a world, and can't afford to carelessly spill the blood of other dar. This principle doesn't apply to the modern goblinoids of Darguun, the \"bugbears\" and \"hobgoblins.\" Physically, these creatures are dar, but they don't know the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand muut as the dar do. The leaders of the Kech Shaarat believe that while it may be possible to use the Darguuls, ultimately, they are not dar and must be treated as enemies. Some of the Kech Volaar are searching for a way to reconcile to these lost kin, expanding the Uul Dhakaan, undoing the damage of the Kapaa'vola and restoring its victims to the fold. Others among the Volaar argue that coexistence should be considered, that the isolationism of the empire must be reconsidered in the face of the widespread, powerful nations of the modern age. But compromise has never been a virtue of the Dhakaani, and what happens next will depend on the Emperor Yet to Come.",

The Dhakaani don't subjugate other species\u2014but not because of compassion. Rather, they consider it inefficient to try to force their values and traditions on creatures who have no concept of muut and who don't share the Uul Dhakaan. Thus, Dhakaani tradition has always been to drive enemies out of their territories, or if such exile is impossible, to kill them.

Founded by the Warlord of the South in the final days of the empire, the Shaarat possess an artifact known as Skai Shaarat\u2014the Great Blade\u2014a sword handed down from warlord to warlord since the days of the Six Kings. While they lack the exotic specialties of the other clans, the Kech Shaarat excel at war. The deep vault of the Kech Shaarat is tied to a demiplane in Khyber known as the Ironlands. This provided them with access to resources and space denied to the other clans, including the byeshk ore the Dhakaani prize for their weapons (as presented in chapter 7), while also keeping them on a constant war footing. Of all the Keepers, the Kech Shaarat have the finest Forge Adept artificers (a new specialization presented in chapter 6), as well as talented Battle Smiths\u2014though the Dhakaani don't generally employ constructs, these artificers have created innovative steel defenders. On the other hand, the Kech Shaarat have not emphasized the role of the duur'kala as much as other clans, and have a weaker bardic tradition.",
												"The Kech Shaarat have emerged into the open and are the most active of the Dhakaani tribes. The warlord Ruus Dhakaan (no relation to the Kech Ruuska, though his name does mean \"Tiger\") has reclaimed several ancient Dhakaani fortresses in the Seawall Mountains, and is working to refortify these ruins. In the course of this expansion, the Kech Shaarat have already absorbed a lesser clan\u2014the Kech Nozhii, who maintained the treasury of the empire\u2014which has expanded their resources. They are actively pressuring the Kech Ruuska to submit to an alliance acknowledging Ruus as the Emperor Yet to Come, and Shaarat warriors have a bitter rivalry with the Kech Volaar.",
												"Ruus has sent representatives to Rhukaan Draal and pledged to support Lhesh Haruuc, but this is a ruse designed to bide time and to take the measure of an enemy. Ruus hasn't revealed the true nature of his people or the full scale of his forces to the Ghaal'dar, and most Darguuls believe the Kech Shaarat are a Ghaal'dar clan with strange traditions. House Deneith is keen to gain the services of these mysterious warriors, but Ruus Dhakaan refuses to have any dealings with the chaat'oor. Ruus Dhakaan is a brilliant strategist and charismatic leader. He earned {@i Skai Shaarat} with his courage and skill, and should never be underestimated. While he's determined to claim the imperial throne, he's also concerned with muut and the good of the empire; he will pressure other Keepers to support his claim, but won't butcher his own kind. However, he's ruthless when it comes to dealing with chaat'oor, and doubts whether the modern \"goblins\" can be redeemed. They may be close enough to dar that they could be worthy servants, but he's considering whether it's simpler to slaughter the Darguuls once the dar are united.",
												"The Kech Shaarat are the most aggressive of the clans, and this is an interesting option for an entire party of dar adventurers. A lone Shaarat dar could be an exile from the clan or a spy evaluating the strengths and fighting styles of the chaat'oor. One option is for a Shaarat player character to have challenged Ruus and been defeated; now they seek an ancient artifact that would allow them to face Ruus again and claim leadership over the clan."

Its people spend much of their time within the Uul Dhakaan itself, using drugs and meditation to enter the dream even while waking. The monks of the Kech Uul are devoted to protecting the dream from outside influences, but they're also experts in navigating the dream itself; if a Dhakaani dreamer is searching for a particular memory or wishes to speak with the dreamvestige of an ancient hero, a Kech Uul monk can be an invaluable guide. Likewise, the uul'kala of the Dream Keepers are the backbone of long-distance communication between clans; the uul'kala maintain message stations at various points within the dream, and can pass a message from one dreamer to another.",

They can serve as a neutral resource supporting all clans, maintaining communication and offering guidance through the dream. However, it could be that they're not what they seem. The Kech Uul have always worked to protect Jhazaal's dream from outside influences, but it's possible the clan has been partially or fully replaced by quori imposters, who plan to influence the Emperor Yet to Come to serve the ends of the Dreaming Dark. Or perhaps the Kech Uul was destroyed long ago by the daelkyr or another threat; the Dream Keepers continue to serve their function, but they're actually long dead, and the chot'uul encountered in the Uul are simply dream-vestiges, memories lingering in Dal Quor.",

They are the most willing to interact with the gath'dar, both because they recognize the need to understand these possible enemies, and in the hopes that some form of coexistence may be possible. Like the Kech Uul, Volaar leader Tuura Dhakaan wonders if the Uul Dhakaan can expand to incorporate other creatures\u2014if the empire can unite gath'dar as it does the dar.",

Volaar duur'kala often travel among the Ghaal'dar sharing stories, helping to educate them about their glorious past and the traditions of muut and atcha; this ties to Tuura's hopes that the \"goblins\" can be redeemed and drawn back to their past glory. Tuura is determined to claim the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come; she hopes to find the strength needed to compel the Kech Shaarat through reclaiming powerful artifacts and building allies.",

The ascetic Khesh'dar aren't compelled by money or power; they choose when to offer aid, and set a fair price on their services. The Khesh'dar take no sides in disputes between clans, and they do not seek to rule; in the present day they serve both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar.

Goblins are spread throughout Khorvaire and most of the great cities of the Five Nations have significant goblin populations, and this provides an easy opportunity for the Khesh'dar to move freely throughout the modern world without drawing attention. The Khesh'dar have been active throughout the last century, spying on the chaat'oor and building up resources and safe houses across the Five Nations. They've recruited many eyes among the modern city goblins and the goblins of Darguun, though these contacts rarely understand exactly who they are dealing with. The Khesh'dar likewise have spies and agents among the golin'dar of every Keeper clan, ensuring that there are few secrets hidden from the Silent Folk.",
												"The Khesh'dar are split into two primary traditions. The Taarka'khesh (\"Silent Wolves\") are swift scouts, experts in wilderness reconnaissance and targeted strikes. The Taarka'khesh typically rely on worg cavalry; many develop an unusual primal bond with their worg companions, and the golin'dar view the worgs as partners, not beasts. Though worgs don't have an innate tie to the Uul Dhakaan, the Beast Master rangers of the Taarka'khesh can summon their worg companions to them while dreaming.",
												"The second Khesh'dar tradition is that of the Shaarat'khesh (\"Silent Blades\"), spies and assassins trained to operate within cities. Both usually operate covertly, disguised to blend in with the local goblin population. However, each order has a distinctive half-mask that is worn over the lower face during formal interactions.",
												"It's up to the DM to decide just how widespread the Khesh'dar are. They may have a single deep vault and only a few hundred operatives, or it could be that they are the largest of the Dhakaani clans, with outposts hidden across Khorvaire. They may have been building networks for thousands of years, simply waiting for the Keepers to rise before putting these resources to use. But are they truly content to serve any emperor? Or do the Khesh'dar have a hidden agenda of their own? Is it possible that they're tied to the Lords of Dust... or even to the dragons of the Chamber?",
												"The Khesh'dar could serve as an espionage agency patron for a group of golin'dar adventurers. More likely, a single character could be an undercover operative of the Khesh'dar, either pursuing a deep, long-term mission or simply gathering intelligence while waiting for specific orders. It's not unusual for the Khesh'dar to seek to cultivate useful allies among the gath'dar. It would be unusual for one of the Khesh'dar to explain their traditions to an outsider, but it's not impossible that a Khesh'dar could form a bond to a gath'dar comrade over the course of their adventures."

Foul chaat'oor hold the lands of the empire and pillage the treasures of the People. But the dar still have their dream. They know what the world should be, and know that together, somehow, they can defy the chaat'oor and restore the eternal empire. However, a long path lies ahead. The dar are badly outnumbered, and can't take on all of the Five Nations in open combat. They don't yet understand the enemy or know what they're capable of. The Kech Volaar, in particular, realize the power of the wide magic of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and recognize they need to know more. There's also the question of whether there's any hope for the modern goblinoids. Can they be instilled with Dhakaani values? Or are they no better than chaat'oor?",

But the last emperor was lost to the Kapaa'vola before the Kech Dhakaan descended into the depths, and no single kech has the power to create a new emperor. The duur'kala speak of the Emperor Yet To Come, with the belief that once all the Keepers rise, a single emperor will somehow win universal acclaim, uniting them all against the chaat'oor. But whether they be lhesh, duur'kala, or daashor, it's unclear what will bring this to pass.",

The Kech Shaarat would prefer not to kill other dar, but Ruus Dhakaan is willing to take steps to prove his power and right to lead, and Shaarat and Volaar agents have clashed in the field.",

There are a few she is especially keen to find: {@i Ur'taash}, the First Crown; {@i Guulen}, the Rod of Kings; and {@i Ghaal'duur}, the horn of Jhazaal Dhakaan. {@i Ur'taash} is currently in the possession of the Khesh Ghaalrac, though its authenticity is in question. The whereabouts of {@i Guulen} and {@i Ghaal'duur} remain unknown. Beyond this, Tuura is evaluating the modern world, working to see if others could be useful allies. So while the Kech Shaarat remain convinced that this conflict is solely based on dominance within the dar, the Kech Volaar believe that knowledge of the modern world is vital to any long-term success.",
										"Other Keepers may devise their own paths to winning allies or the throne, and there may be Keeper clans that have yet to be revealed. For now, the Kech Dhakaan are focused on gathering information and competing among themselves.

While the Shaarat'khesh are best known for their assassins, specialists can be found following almost any archetype. The Silent Folk train and can dispatch Thieves when necessary. Arcane Tricksters have adapted a form of the duur'kala's magic. And if you're using {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}, Inquisitive rogues are the top spies of the Khesh'dar, while a handful of Masterminds serve as expert strategists. It's entirely possible to run a campaign around a team of Shaarat'khesh rogues with different specialties, with the Khesh'dar serving as an espionage patron. Outside of the Khesh'dar, the Kech Nasaar are the only clan that regularly trains ghaal'dar spies and assassins."

Focused on martial discipline, the Dhakaani never unlocked the secrets of wizardry or embraced eldritch bargains\u2014but today, the Kech Volaar are actively trying to bridge this gap in their arsenal. As a Volaar wizard, you can follow any path; the key is that you are likely a trailblazer and your accomplishments and discoveries may be very important to your people. There is no established tradition of sorcery among the Dhakaani, but the Volaar are likewise seeking out any dar who show signs of sorcerous potential. The clan has even been experimenting with warlocks, actively seeking out arcane patrons and attempted controlled studies. So as a Volaar warlock, you might be the first dar to work with this particular patron, and your superiors are eager to see how it turns out.",
														"There are a few other options for arcane spellcasters. Depending on the path the DM decides to take with the Kech Hashraac, they could be training Evokers; like the Volaar wizards, this would reflect cutting-edge research. The Kech Nasaar have been studying necromancy for a long time and may have developed Necromancer wizards. The Nasaar are more willing than most to dally with sinister powers, and it's likewise possible that they've had a tradition of warlocks."

But they don't believe that there are cosmic powers or prophecies that control fate. It is possible to play a Dhakaani paladin who draws their divine power from their absolute devotion to the empire, or a cleric who channels power from the Uul Dhakaan. But this was always intended as an intentional gap in the capabilities of the Dhakaani: they have far greater martial skill than most of the cultures of Khorvaire, but they simply don't have access to divine magic."

While most modern goblinoids have adopted these terms themselves, the dar maintain the old ways.",

While the goblinoids of the Kech Dhakaan\u2014the {@i dar}\u2014are physically identical to their modern cousins, there are some important differences. The dar are bound together both by the philosophy of muut and atcha and by the spiritual connection of the Uul Dhakaan. Their lives are shaped by a relentless martial culture and a rigid caste system. As one of the dar, you know your place in society and have undergone intense training to hone your natural strengths. The racial traits in chapter 6 reflect that training, but if you were raised outside of Dhakaani society, you should instead use the standard goblinoid traits."

Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that's enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization\u2014or ruins of it\u2014waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there's no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice.

The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts.

The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn't decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables.

Mror talespinners say that the Sovereign Onatar had his forge in the mountains, and that Kol Korran kept his hoard beneath it; other scholars have speculated that there could be a more unsavory supernatural force at work, an overlord tied to greed bound beneath the peaks. Whatever the truth, this led to the period known as {@i Korran Hal}, Korran's Blessing. Even with the taxes owed to Galifar, the Mror prospered and built a thriving society. While the ancient feuds were never forgotten, violence was no longer their first answer. The bearers of the Dragonmark of Warding, Clan Kundarak, were drawn into the Twelve and became House Kundarak.

Typically, a Mror tale refers to heroes and villains solely by their family names.

In one tale, he is a heroic youth, and in another, she is a battle-scarred veteran, and yet they're depicted as the same Mroranon. And in both cases, all Mroranon dwarves should strive to live up to that example. Where the Tairnadal elves seek to emulate specific ancestors, Mror dwarves view their family as a greater whole. Your family is a direct extension of your identity; it's only natural that you'd help a family member in need, and betraying a family member is like stabbing yourself in the hand. This drives feuds and alliances; if you're wronged by a Hronnath dwarf, the blame lies with Clan Hronnath, not simply the individual. To draw another comparison to the elves, the Aereni preserve their ancestors as deathless undead. In contrast, the Mror don't feel that need to preserve individuals; you preserve your family by living up to its character and by adding to its story. The Mror also aren't as particular about precisely following the traditions of ancestors, as shown by the clans that are embracing symbionts; what you do is less important than how you do it, the values you stand for, and the lines you refuse to cross.",
												"This doesn't mean that Mror don't take personal responsibility for their actions or feel pride in their personal deeds. The deeds of living dwarves are generally acknowledged by name, but when they take their place in history, their names are unlikely to be remembered. Instead, every dwarf hopes that their grand deeds will be added to the trove of stories told of their family\u2014and that they won't shame their family with the memories of their misdeeds.",
												"In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider your family. Are you part of a clan or ruling clan? If so, are you close enough to power to take the noble background, or are you a lesser heir? Are you from a tenant family, and if so, what is your family's business? Even more crucial, what is your family's {@i character}? When people tell stories about your family, what are the virtues they highlight? Are there any particular things your family is known for, any celebrated deeds you might emulate, or anything a member of your family should never do? Some families have specific taboos; a Tronnan must never break their word, while a Holladon never turns away a guest. Does your family have any such traditions?",
												"Also consider how your family was affected by the Dol Udar. Did they invest deeply in the depths, only to suffer grievous losses when the horrors rose? Did they fight on the front lines, or largely remain above? Do they have a family treasure recovered from the Realm Below\u2014a legendary item or artifact you might someday have the honor to wield? Are they willing to embrace symbionts, or are they disgusted by the tools of the daelkyr?",
												"Finally, what is your standing with your family? If it's good, consider why you left the Mror Holds; chapter 1 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} includes a table with suggestions for this. If your standing is bad, what happened? Is it a situation you hope to fix, or have you turned your back on your family? As a player, talk to your DM about the role your family might play in a campaign; do you want to have cousins showing up in need of assistance or to be drawn into new feuds, or would you rather your family remain in your backstory?"

												"The Mror attitude toward family is one example of how they deal with their long lives. A dwarf can live to be up to 350 years old; intellectually, they mature at about the same rate as humans, but they generally aren't considered to be full adults until around 50 years of age. This ties to the fact that dwarves have a low fertility rate and their reproductive peak is between 50 and 120. While under 50, a Mror dwarf is usually learning the family trade and working directly for their parents, uncles, or aunts; at 50 and above, a dwarf starts thinking about starting their own branch of the family tree and the family trade.",
												"In stark contrast to the elves of Aerenal, the Mror dwarves deal with their long lives by largely ignoring the passage of time: they intentionally don't record every detail or remember every person, instead simply holding on to the best moments and ideas. To them, the story matters more than the concrete facts. Individuals come and go, but the family remains, and the story continues. And the Mror deeply love stories. Like the dar, they prefer stories to be based on fact as opposed to being absolute fiction\u2014but to the Mror, a story should always be entertaining, and as long as the spirit is true, it's fine to exaggerate the details. So while the talespinner bard serves as a keeper of history, their role as entertainers is as important\u2014if not more so\u2014than their role as sage.",
												"Mror dwarves can be seen as boastful by outsiders, quick to share tales of their exploits. However, they don't seek to dominate every conversation with their tales, but expect others to share their stories as well\u2014and if others don't, Mror are quick to boast about the deeds of their companions. Anyone who spends much time around Mror quickly grows used to the phrase {@i Tol kollan}\u2014or the Common translation, \"That reminds me of a story.\" Mror hate quick meetings; any gathering should have time for tales. In playing a Mror character, you might come up with a few stories you love, as well as taking joy in dramatically retelling the story of your adventures\u2014the deeds of both you and your fellow adventurers\u2014celebrating and highlighting your finest moments."

In particular, the arrival of the dragonmarked houses forced many families to change their paths or to find a way to work with the houses. The Jolnar family of Toldrathhold had been healers for generations, but they couldn't match the healing capabilities of House Jorasco. Over time, the Jolnar shifted their focus to cultivating medicinal herbs and other supplies needed by Jorasco. They are still devoted to the health of others, but they've found a way to work with Jorasco instead of directly challenging it.",

However, the dwarves are not greedy hoarders; while there are certain families known for their thrift, generosity is an important virtue to the Mror. As much as they value their treasures, there's joy in giving the perfect gift\u2014showing that you can afford to give away a treasure, and that you recognize someone who will appreciate it and make good use of it. A common tradition at a grand feast is for each of the greatest heroes present\u2014typically, the scions of ruling clans\u2014to offer a gift to the host along with a tale of how they came by the gift; the one who gives the finest gift is served first at the feast.",

Sometimes these are the most powerful magic items the dwarves have acquired, notably the case with artifacts and legendary items that have been recovered from the Realm Below over the last century; part of the pride of the ruling clans is derived from the treasures they can boast of. But a family treasure can also be a mundane item that has been a part of many epic stories. As noted earlier, no one cares which specific Mroranon heir was the hero of {@i Mroranon and the Troll King}. But if the house still has the bracer that hero made from the troll king's nose ring, carrying this relic is a tremendous source of pride. As a Mror adventurer, when you find treasures, you want to know the stories they already carrying\u2014who forged this flame tongue shortsword and what battles has it seen?

Because of this, dwarves from lesser families may only have a single set of clothing, but these are durable and well made. Though their basic outfits may be few, Mror place great stock in accessories, and a Mror outfit typically has elements that can be reversed, shifted, or removed. Brooches have important cultural significance, and can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, the symbol of a Sovereign whose favor is sought, or even moods; some brooches mean \"leave me alone\" or \"looking for company.\" Other forms of jewelry\u2014rings, chains, bracelets\u2014are commonly worn by dwarves of both genders; this is an opportunity to show wealth, but decorative ornaments of iron are also worn by common folk. The {@i dultar}\u2014blood blade\u2014is a dagger worn both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance; each of the ruling clans has a distinct style of dultar.

Many clans weave beads into beards, with the design of the bead invoking the favor of a Sovereign or honoring a clan. Hair dye is often used as a form of personal expression.",
												"Clans that have embraced the use of symbionts\u2014notably Soldorak, Toranath, and Narathun\u2014have developed many exotic fashions over the last century. For such dwarves, wearing symbiont clothing or accessories is a sign of courage and power, much as a hunter might wear the hides of animals they've defeated. Living clothing typically has a texture similar to leather, though chitin plating or hornlike protrusions are possible. Patterns or colors may shift to reflect the mood of the wearer, and a living cloak may ripple or billow of its own accord. Living clothing is self-cleaning and mending, and feeds on the excretions (primarily sweat) of the host. Narathun currently has the finest artisan-breeders working with living clothing, and styles are constantly evolving"

Red pudding is a form of peaceful ooze raised as livestock and used in a variety of dishes.

The priests of Krona Peak say that Kol Korran came to the hero Mroranon and promised the dwarves wealth if they remembered his name and followed his path, while the talespinners of Doldarunhold swear that the hero Doldarun was the son of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah. The records of the Library of Korranberg show that Zil missionaries were active in the Ironroots in the centuries before Bal Dulor, and some sages assert that these tales may have been the work of clever missionaries.

Critically, a clan holds domain both over its territory and all that lies below it. Early in the tenth century, miners in multiple holds broke through to the Realm Below. Wide tunnels shaped by elemental magic led to grand halls and subterranean cities crafted with techniques far beyond those of the modern Mror earthmovers. Avenues were lit by {@spell continual flame}, and environmental enchantments ensured purity of air and comfortable climate. One might think the dwarves would have been more curious about the fate of the builders, but the ancient halls were entirely empty, with no signs of blood or bone.

It may be the fault of adventurers and explorers who pressed too deep, ever searching for greater treasures. Or it could be that Dyrrn and its minions were watching the Mror expansion all along, waiting for the civilian population in the subterranean colonies to reach a critical level. At first, scouts brought back reports of newly exposed tunnels and chambers, of passages coated with unnatural fluids and strange things growing among mushroom gardens. Then the scouts stopped returning and the first wave of attacks began. Squads of dolgrims. Chokers lurking in the shadows. Soldorakhold faced howling mobs of derro\u2014possibly the twisted survivors of Noldrunhold, the Lost Clan (described later in this chapter). Strange plagues and implacable oozes spread through the sunken colonies of Londurak. It was a time of terror, but also determination: whatever this unknown threat was, it must be held in the depths at any cost.",
												"Armies were rallied, clans sending their finest soldiers into the depths, while every citizen trained with axe and hammer in preparation for dolgrim raids or a more dramatic surface assault. While some clans considered withdrawal, pride and a hunger for the wealth and wonders still hidden kept the dwarves fighting. They believed if they didn't hold them below, the aberrations would merely follow them to the surface. The years that followed were a time of endless terror and uncertainty. As the horrors were driven back in one hold, they would strike with redoubled force in another. New threats appeared with alarming regularity; dolgrims and derro were common foes, but there was no telling when a previously unknown danger would rise.",
												"Two major discoveries shaped the second decade of the war. The first was the revelation of the enemy the Mror faced: the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. In 943 YK, the illithid Dyrrashar seized the colony below Loran's Gate in Soldorakhold, and broadcast a psychic message known as Dyrrn's Promise. This telepathic message didn't take the form of words, and attempts to transcribe it have produced widely varied translations. But the thrust was this: \"You have drawn the gaze of the Overmind. You walk the Foul Labyrinth. Everything will change.\" Clan Soldorak eventually retook Loran's Gate and forced Dyrrashar to retreat, but the illithid general has risen elsewhere and remains at large today. None who experienced Dyrrn's Promise can ever forget it.",
												"Even as Dyrrn's Promise spread fear, a second discovery brought hope. Following grave losses, Clan Londurak withdrew its forces to the surface. The Londurak prepared their defenses for a surface attack... but it never came. This pattern was repeated in other spires and holds; though the reasons are unclear, Dyrrn's forces won't pursue their enemies beyond Sol Udar."

Regardless of the reason, the war has been in a stalemate over the last few years. But many sages believe that complacency is foolish, and until they know with absolute certainty what keeps Dyrrn's forces from rising to the surface, they can't know their protection will last. And even if the dolgrim hordes won't leave the tunnels and there's no threat of a large-scale assault, the Slithering Lord could be unfolding more subtle schemes.",

Most of the other major clans maintain lines in the depths, defending claimed mines and colonies with steel and blood. These territories are secured by heavy fortifications, strong enough to repel attack, though serving on the line is a dangerous job. But the dwarves aren't trying to press beyond their current lines, for if they venture across it, their fate is unknown.",

But there have been all too many casualties over the past few decades, and there is still considerable fear that the current lull is a trick\u2014that Dyrrn is building forces for a renewed assault. And no one knows if there is a way to win the war once and for all, or if it's just a matter of advancing the line another hundred feet.

They understood Khyber's systems of demiplanes in a way even the Dhakaani haven't mastered; many clan lords dream of bottomless mines or resources that can't be found in the natural world. Beyond the innate desire for these things, for the Mror, it's a matter of pride. Sol Udar is the work of their ancestors. The knowledge that it holds, the untold wealth, this is their birthright. It's a burning reminder that they could be more than they are now\u2014they could be greater than the Five Nations or the Aereni. Additionally, many dwarves are driven by their desire to know the story\u2014to understand who their ancestors were and what became of them.",

As the aberrations generally don't come to the surface, there are places where the uppermost passage has simply been sealed with magic and steel.

In most cases, soldiers won't prevent someone from proceeding into the depths\u2014but anyone returning goes through careful scrutiny to ensure they haven't been infected by unnatural influences.

Barring any alien influence, the air is renewed by magic and remarkably fresh; a permanent prestidigitation effect keeps these halls clean after thousands of years and untold conflicts.

The people of Sol Udar weren't warlike by nature. Their halls contain great forges and foundries, but many of their wonders are utilitarian. An Udar kitchen has tools that replicate the heating, chilling, and flavoring effects of {@spell prestidigitation}, and might have a builtin {@item alchemy jug} to dispense whatever liquids are needed. Of course, not all enchantments are automatically noticeable, and many effects require some form of command word or gesture to activate; modern colonists who have settled in the upper levels of Sol Udar are still struggling to understand the full capabilities of their new home.",

Demiplanes are entirely unpredictable in size, some no larger than a town, with others the size of Khorvaire itself. Within a demiplane, time might run differently. Gemstones could grow on trees. A demiplane can have its own sun, and provide vegetation and other resources that couldn't be found in any natural cave.

A system tied to demiplanes? Whatever this was, it has yet to be discovered, and may lie on the lower levels held by Dyrrn's minions. In creating a section of the Realm Below for an adventure, the DM should think about the purpose of this particular area. Was it an industrial center? A residential community? A hospital? A prison? If it contains a passage to a demiplane, the nature of the demiplane should relate to the function of the community; if it's a hospital, perhaps the local demiplane has alien vegetation that has remarkable medicinal properties.

Other derro could be more recent victims, created from Mror settlers captured in the Dol Udar. The derro are nomadic scavengers who remain in constant motion, roaming the deep tunnels of the Realm Below. They completely ignore Dyrrn's aberrations, and seem to be ignored in turn; one scout reported seeing a derro band walk through a dolgrim camp, without acknowledgment from either side. Some scholars believe that the derro can't perceive the aberrations, and that some believe themselves to be in a reality in which Sol Udar is still in its time of glory, and the derro are its lords. They don't appear to serve Dyrrn directly, but they definitely see all outsiders from above as enemies.

However, the purpose of areas claimed by Dyrrn's forces varies widely. In some cases, there's a clear logic to what these creatures are doing: dolgrims could have seized an ancient foundry and begun forging weapons. Explorers could find some sort of spawning pit where new aberrations are being produced. But the behavior of aberrations is often alien and inexplicable; a chamber could contain a giant, beating heart that serves no apparent purpose, or a pool of liquid that reflects another location. The inhabitants of the depths are unpredictable, and aberrations may not have the same biological needs as natural humanoids; for example, dolgrims don't need to work subterranean farms for food.",
												"Some aberrations are permanently settled in a region, but others may spill out of portals to Dyrrn's domain, and others may be grown on the spot by the organic matter spread throughout infested regions, or created from the corpses of foolish explorers. A gibbering mouther may whisper with the voices of the dwarves who ventured into the depths last week.",
												"While mind flayers can be found serving any daelkyr, Dyrrn the Corruptor is their creator. Sol Udar is thus a logical place to encounter mind flayers or any creatures associated with them: intellect devourers, ulitharids, neothelids, and the like. Bear in mind that these creatures may serve a very different role in Eberron than in other settings, as they are the creations of Dyrrn; a neothelid may be an intentional creation, as opposed to an accidental abomination. Elder brains are tools used as telepathic anchors, linking local mind flayers, while the elder brains are linked to Dyrrn itself. In general, mind flayers serve as Dyrrn's emissaries and lieutenants\u2014directing lesser aberrations or humanoid cults, or engaged in inscrutable research. The most infamous mind flayer is Dyrrashar, the ulitharid who delivered Dyrrn's Promise. It has appeared multiple times since then, often leading subtle attacks against Udar colonies.",
												"Most other threats are encountered in isolation, and almost any sort of aberration could be found in the darkness; you can also use unusual variations of aberrations or monstrosities, shifting the creature to fit your story. For example, beholders primarily serve Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes, but Dyrrn could have beholder servitors with beaks surrounded with tentacles, as opposed to toothy maws."

										"The first Mror dwarves to explore Sol Udar were amazed at the treasures they found. While there was no sign of the original inhabitants, their possessions remained. Early explorers found remarkable jewelry, intriguing artwork, and caskets of coins\u2014but magic items were often the most valuable. Many of these are like those found in the Five Nations, with a focus on practicality\u2014items such as the {@item alchemy jug}, {@item bag of holding}, or {@item decanter of endless water}. While similar items are produced in the Five Nations, the arcane techniques used are intriguing, and some items displayed superior qualities; one team of scouts found an alchemy keg that's bulkier than the standard jug, but can produce twice the amount of liquid each day\u2014and the alcohol it produces is far more potent than that of a standard {@item alchemy jug}. The {@table Sol Udar Trinkets|ExploringEberron} table presents some interesting items, both magical and mundane, that might be found adventuring in the Realm Below.",
										"Beyond the minor curiosities scattered throughout Sol Udar, there were far greater treasures\u2014legendary magic items and artifacts, things that can't be created in the present day. Only a few of these wonders have been found, and these have become a source of immense pride for the clans that possess them. It's common for a clan to declare such items to be the work of their ancestors, though this is typically a talespinner's fancy. Little concrete scholarship has been done on most of these treasures, and despite the commonly accepted myth of the dwarven exile, there's no reason to think that the ancestors of the modern Mror were all distributed evenly around the mountains, their descendants just happening to have remained exactly above their ancestral homes. Nonetheless, these relics are seen as proof of the power and potential of a clan, and most clan leaders don't look kindly on outsiders questioning their stories. Surely even more powerful and precious artifacts remain to be found in the deeper layers of the Realm Below, but the Dol Udar has kept the Mror from claiming these wonders.",
										"While battling aberrations and making expeditions into infested layers, the dwarves recovered another unusual treasure\u2014symbionts, living tools crafted by the daelkyr. Chapter 7 presents eight new symbionts that might be found in the Realm Below. Many clans want nothing to do with these foul things; Doldarun dwarves always burn symbionts with the corpses of the creatures that carry them. But not all dwarves share this distaste. Some clans see symbionts as just another form of treasure from the depths. The Toldorath and Droranath dwarves have no fear of symbionts, and a warrior may carry a {@i hungry axe} (as described in chapter 7) without protest from their clan; but these clans haven't embraced symbionts beyond keeping the trophies taken from fallen enemies. Both Soldorak and Narathun have gone further; in addition to using salvaged symbionts, these clans have spent decades studying the science behind these items and creating their own symbionts. In some cases, they are replicating existing items, but Soldorak fleshcrafters have also created unique symbionts, integrating the principles of daelkyr magic with their own arcane traditions. Those clans that favor such tools call fleshcrafted items {@i dolaur}\u2014spoils of war. On the other hand, those that despise them often call symbionts and those who use them {@i dularash}\u2014foul blood\u2014a term often used to refer to spoiled meat or corrupted bloodlines.",
										"Many existing magic items can be reflavored as symbionts. A Soldorak artificer might create a {@item cloak of elvenkind}, but formed of leathery, living flesh that shifts in hue like a chameleon. A Narathun {@item rope of climbing|XGE} isn't rope at all, but a coiled tentacle that follows the commands of the creature holding it. The Soldorak have created {@i lighting bugs}\u2014identical in function to {@item everbright lantern||everbright lanterns}, but able to cling or detach to a surface on command. These bugs need to be fed a few drops of blood each day, and in communities that use these, the former lamplighters now walk the streets to feed the bugs from their own body.",
										"Outsiders may be horrified by these living tools, but the motives of dwarves that use them are rational to many of their people. To many Mror, these items are trophies, concrete proof of Mror victories over the daelkyr: \"If you took a magic axe from a fallen foe, you'd be a fool to throw it away. So what if it moans when it kills? It's a powerful weapon, and it's mine by right of conquest!\" Many Mror also see carrying these tools as a sign of their courage, proudly demonstrating they aren't afraid to put on living armor. They may bask in the fear that their treasures instill in their enemies. In addition, both Soldorak and Narathun are ambitious clans, and leaders hope that by unlocking the secrets of fleshcrafting, they can increase the power of their clans.",
										"Those clans that revile symbionts say that fleshcrafting is an abomination and an affront to Aureon and Onatar. The Narathun counter that Onatar is the master artisan and can work with any material; it is the doubters who insult Onatar by thinking his servants can't master this new medium. This argument has found supporters in Clan Soranath; while the Soranath dwarves don't fully embrace symbionts as the Soldorak and Narathun do, they are interested in the science of fleshcrafting and have been studying these techniques.",
										"The clans that embrace these techniques say that there is no danger, that this is just another form of science, while Doldarun dwarves insist that there can be no traffic with the daelkyr without corruption. The DM will have to decide the truth\u2014can Soldorak benefit from their exploration of fleshcrafting, or are their warlocks and artificers being corrupted by Dyrrn? Whatever the truth of it, tensions between those clans who embrace these tools and those who revile them continue to rise.",
										"A character exploring the fleshcrafting techniques could be an artificer, describing their spellcasting as being tied to organic tools. Other arcane scholars who explore the techniques of the daelkyr become warlocks, typically using the Great Old One as their patron. In creating a Mror warlock, consider whether you're bargaining with Dyrrn itself\u2014are you a cultist of the Dragon Below, willing to serve the daelkyr to gain power? Or have you gained your powers from studying the daelkyr and their methods, but instead of serving them, you're essentially stealing their techniques and hacking their systems? If you follow the latter path, you might not have a literal patron at all, or your \"patron\" could be a cabal of other dwarves studying the same techniques, and their requests help all of you learn more about fleshcrafting. Or if your DM is willing, perhaps you can even tap into the telepathic network of Dyrrn and the elder brains to steal their secrets; rather than receiving requests from your \"patron,\" you gain flashes of insight or information about them\u2014attacks that are going to happen, plans you might stop\u2014that could drive your actions."

This section provides an overview of the twelve ruling clans, including their most remarkable mineral resources, their established feuds, and the virtues they assign to their mythic founder\u2014and thus, the virtues they strive to embody. It's worth noting that almost all Mror value many of these virtues, but in their stories, one founder is acknowledged as the best at that thing. Clan Doldarun certainly values strength, but in the story, Doldarun's defining feature is his courage and integrity, while Droranath is known for his untamable strength. Likewise, while each clan includes suggestions for possible character classes, any character could come from any clan; in particular, talespinner bards and entertainers are found in every clan.",

In creating a Mror character, it's up to you whether your character is tied directly to a ruling clan or if you're part of a lesser family. While many Mror take inspiration from their ruling clan, they don't all share the same virtues; in creating a Mror family of your own, you can decide what their celebrated virtues are.",
										"Among the Mror, the dwarven subraces largely reflect their culture and personal aptitude, not bloodlines, and a Mror dwarf can take any subrace.

The clan maintains a garrisoned colony below Silverblade Keep, and is building strength for a new offensive. In the meantime, Doldarun draws a hard line against trafficking with the daelkyr or any form of fleshcrafting, and any outsider carrying symbionts receives a very hostile reaction in Doldarunhold.

The Droranath never became miners; they are hunters, farmers, and above all, fierce warriors. Droranath youths have always trained with axe and hammer, long before Dol Udar made the practice common among the clans, and hide armor is standard fashion among the clan. Some Droranath develop the skills of the stealthy hunter, striking down enemies from afar, but most Droranath warriors prefer to look their enemy in the eye and to see their fear. Droranath warriors perfect a technique called {@i tra dolhass}\u2014the battle cry\u2014a wild howl as the warrior charges the enemy, summoning their adrenaline and fury. The Droranath love battle, and for centuries they have sold their services as mercenaries through House Deneith. The \"Mror Howlers\" are valued as shock troops and vanguard warriors.

But despite their deep similarities in outlook and lifestyle, these two clans are constantly feuding. This rarely escalates to violence, instead typically driving them to find ways to perform better than their rivals, though there have been times where one clan has actively sabotaged the other. Despite this, both Lanarak and Londurak proclaim to possess vast common sense\u2014to prefer fishing to fighting, and to always be able to find a simple solution to complex problems. Dwarves from these clans established inns across the holds; these days, most of these inns have been bought up or licensed by House Ghallanda, but there's a decent chance that if a bartender's a dwarf, they're from one of these two clans.",

Londurak quickly pulled out of the war; they have sealed all passages and forbidden anyone from venturing into Sol Udar. Lanarak still tends its gardens on the upper levels. This has given Lanarak an edge over its rivals, especially as traditional Mror spirits are made with mushrooms. However, Lanarak has also suffered several significant supernatural attacks over the last few decades\u2014outbreaks of the Frenzy and similar threats.

In all of the stories, Soldorak supports underdogs and challenges outdated systems and oppressive authority. In some ways, this is at odds with the fact that Soldorak remains part of the feudal system that has defined the holds for a thousand years. However, Soldorak is more flexible than the other clans. Tenant families have a path to become freeholders, and much like the Aereni, Soldorak seeks to draw the most talented dwarves from all walks of life into the ruling clan. However, this is a knife that cuts both ways; people can also be expelled from the ruling clan, and heirs are expected to constantly prove their worth and cunning, not to simply rest on the power of their name.",

The ends justify the means.\" They believe the common concept of \"honor\" is a trick that serves those in power; true honor lies in using your wits to defeat impossible odds.

												"Soldorak is one of the most populous holds, and one of the richest. Its fortune lies in all manner of precious metals, especially platinum and gold; coins from the Soldorak Mint circulate across Khorvaire, and Soldorak has many foreign investments. It has invested deeply in the Realm Below and is second only to Clan Mroranon in its subterranean holdings. However, Soldorak has embraced the use of {@i dolaur}\u2014symbionts\u2014and continues to explore the alien powers of the daelkyr even while it recovers dwarf artifacts. Soldorak has also embraced the path of the warlock. These dwarves have less patience for arcane study than their allies in Narathun, and are less likely to become artificers or wizards. But bargaining for power, earning supernatural gifts with your wits and will? That's the Soldorak way. Soldorak maintains that this tradition is entirely safe\u2014that Sol warlocks can tap the power of the daelkyr without serving them\u2014but Doldarun is certain that all Soldorak dwarves are corrupt, and Mroranon sees this foul practice as another way to discredit its rivals.",
												"While it's home to nobles and soldiers, Soldorakhold also has more than its fair share of charlatans and criminals. It's a haven for all manner of rogues and warlocks, especially Great Old One warlocks manipulating the powers of the daelkyr. While outsiders view the Soldorak as evil, they are primarily about challenging tradition and refusing to accept unearned authority; a Soldorak folk hero could champion underdogs anywhere in Khorvaire. Soldorak dwarves are typically skeptical of organized religion; there are relatively few temples in the region, and clerics and acolytes are uncommon."

Clan Soranath is one of the smallest clans, but its influence reflects the talents of its artisans. Other clans have mines and fields\u2014it's Soranath who takes what they produce and makes wonders.",
												"Not all artisans are from Soranath, just as not all of the denizens of Soranathhold are artisans. Most blades in Mroranonhold are forged by Mroranon smiths. But Soranath artisans are unmatched in their techniques and their work ethic. Rather than being bound by secrets of the past, Soranath smiths are always looking for ways to improve their techniques, searching for new sources of inspiration. While this sounds impressive, Soranath is a small hold with limited resources, without the capabilities either in research or production of House Cannith or the Arcane Congress. The artisans of Clan Soranath won't change the world with their works, but they produce remarkable things for those who can afford it.",
												"Soranathhold is small, with only three spires. Its families are tightly knit, and the divide between tenant and clan is a thin line. Industry is the prime virtue of Soranath, and its people work hard and live austere lives; for Soranath dwarves, a job done well is more satisfying than any luxury. Soranath has abundant deposits of dragonshard geodes, and thus isn't dependent on Tharashk, but doesn't seek to challenge Tharashk as an exporter of shards. Due to its otherwise limited resources, Soranath is dependent on other clans for many things, including protection. Soranath artificers are fascinated by the potential of the Realm Below and what they could learn both from the Udar artifacts and the symbionts of the daelkyr, and Grayroot Spire has been experimenting with fleshcrafting. However, they are artisans, not warriors; they must hire others to venture into Sol Udar on their behalf.",
												"The Soranath dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, especially to Onatar; they are quick to assign credit for any great work to the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. There may also be a cult of the Traveler within Soranath, perhaps in Grayroot Spire; if so, it keeps its true devotion well hidden.",
												"Soranath dwarves are generally guild artisans, acolytes, or sages. Artificers (primarily Battle Smiths) and clerics of the Forge are both logical classes for Soranath dwarves."

They followed the same path, shared the same labors, and even built their holds adjacent to one another; the city of Frosthaven lies directly between the two holds and serves as the capital for both.",
												"Toldorath and Tordannon had many skills, though they were masters of few. They were hunters and herders, warriors and miners. But above all, they were the most gifted healers of the exiles, ready to help anyone in need. Before Bal Dolur, Frosthaven healers were found across the holds. This changed with the arrival of House Jorasco. Today the finest healers in the Mror Holds are halflings, but dwarves still serve in the healing houses. More importantly, the farms of Toldorath and Tordannon are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and flowers that drive Jorasco operations across Khorvaire.",
												"At a glance, Toldorath and Tordannon have much in common. They mine copper and herd mountain tribex and other beasts on the fields surrounding Mirror Lake. They're stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these clans\u2014to family, clan, and the holds themselves.",
												"But there is one thing that makes these two Frosthaven clans stand out: their support for the Jhorash'tar orcs. A story says an orc shaman taught the healing arts to Toldorath and Tordannon in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy\u2014the modern Jhorash'tar aren't particularly adept healers\u2014but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash'tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.",
												"Toldorath and Tordannon have no specialty that calls out a specific style of adventurer, but this just means that any character could come from Frosthaven. They have soldiers and fighters, hunters and rangers. What drives these clans is loyalty and kindness, their belief that it's always better to make a new friend than to dismiss someone as an enemy."

While House Sivis estimates that Kundarak's dragonmark appeared less than three thousand years ago, in the stories, Kundarak had always borne the mark and used its powers to protect their people. Dwarves of all clans relied on Kundarak, both for wise counsel and their expertise in building. Kundarak laid the foundations of the fortresses that stood against the armies of Galifar.",
												"But soon after Bal Dulor, Clan Kundarak became House Kundarak, expanding its influence across Khorvaire. While they held onto their ancestral lands, the Korth Edicts required Kundarak to sever its ties to the other clans, putting the interests of its clients ahead of those of the Mror. While this caused initial tension, it also brought an influx of gold and influence, and served as a bridge between the holds and the outside world. Kundarak helped bring dragonmarked services to the Mror Holds, and also helped build connections between houses and clans\u2014House Deneith and the Droranath, House Jorasco and the Frosthaven clans. So while there was some estrangement, the clans generally accepted Kundarak's new role\u2014though Soldorak has long decried Kundarak as abandoning traditional values and selling out the dwarves.",

Kundarak has done its best to stay out of the War Below, though Kundarak engineers played an important part in building defenses during the War Below, and were well paid for their services. Despite the lure of treasures and the mysteries of the past, Kundarak has no interest in courting disaster beneath the very seat of its power; it has fortified all deep portals beneath its spires.

Noldrun was clever and curious, an explorer who was always finding new things. Noldrunhold was never a large clan, but its greatest mine\u2014Korran's Maw\u2014was a rich source for a seemingly impossible array of minerals, including Eberron and Khyber dragonshards. This made it a strong ally of House Kundarak and Zilargo, and brought tremendous wealth to the clan.",
												"And then, approximately four hundred years ago, Noldrunhold fell silent. Messengers sent into the hold never returned. Noldrun had previously fought many fierce battles with the Jhorash'tar, and blame immediately fell to the orcs; but none could explain how the Jhorash'tar could have achieved such a massacre.",
												"The fate of Noldrunhold remains a mystery to this day. Most contemporary records of what explorers found were passed down orally and are unreliable. In some accounts, corpses were skinned; in others, there were no corpses, as if the Noldrun had all simply vanished. Some suggest that the Noldrun all gathered together and descended into Korran's Maw; others say the Jhorash'tar killed them and threw the bodies into the Maw. Neighboring clans Soldorak and Droranath both sought to expand into the abandoned territory and claim the empty spires, but all attempts were abandoned\u2014again, the stories of why are unreliable. Some say the new settlers killed each other in an irrational frenzy, others say they simply disappeared. The Droranath blame the Jhorash'tar orcs, and mysteriously, there are tribes of Jhorash'tar still living on old Noldrun lands, though even they shun the empty cities and Korran's Maw.",
												"Today, many assume that the Noldrun must have been the first victims of the War Below\u2014that they dug too deep and were destroyed by Dyrrn. Some assume the derro found in Sol Udar are the remnants of the Noldrun dwarves. But that's all just conjecture. Perhaps it was the work of a fiendish overlord imprisoned in the region. Perhaps it was an early impact of whatever caused the Mourning, or some sort of Cannith experiment. Or perhaps it was the Jhorash'tar after all, and the orcs possess some hidden power they have yet to reveal."

The Jhorash'tar have no written records, but their tales suggest they once held most of the Ironroots, and that many of their tribes were annihilated in the early days of the Exile. However, others suggest that the orcs might have been eradicated by the civilization that built Sol Udar. Indeed, the existence of the Face of Mror\u2014a mountain sculpted to resemble a dwarf king, a feat of engineering far beyond the capabilities of the modern Mror\u2014implies the dwarves of Sol Udar were active on the surface of the mountains at some point. Whatever the truth, by the time of Bal Dulor, the bulk of the Jhorash'tar had been pushed to the southwestern regions of the Ironroot Mountains, where they continued to clash with Clan Droranath and Clan Noldrun.",
												"The Jhorash'tar orcs have a distinct culture, with nothing in common with the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes or the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches. There are at least six distinct tribes, each split into smaller bands; the DM can add details to a particular tribe to suit the story. Some dwell on the surface of the mountains\u2014often in caves along canyon walls\u2014while others dwell underground, in the same layer the dwarves mined for centuries before breaking through into Sol Udar. The Jhorash'tar have never formed large communities, and usually split when a band has a hundred or more adult members, or whenever a bonecaster\u2014their spiritual leader\u2014advises it.",
												"The primary spiritual tradition of the Jhorash'tar is called the Path of Bones. Bonecasters are their priests and diviners. They can speak with the dead and temporarily conjure spirits to produce magical effects, but traditionally they don't create lasting undead. A player character following this path might be a cleric with the Grave domain, though the typical bonecaster doesn't have access to all the spells and features of a cleric. Bonesworn are elite champions strengthened by spirits; a player character following this path could be an Ancestral Guardian or Zealot barbarian. The Jhorash'tar believe that the ghosts of the fallen linger, and continue to guide the living through whispers and dreams. Tribes often decorate the entrances of their dwellings with the bones of their own fallen warriors, believing that the spirits of the fallen protect them.",
												"The Jhorash'tar don't work metal, though some are willing to use metal weapons and armor acquired from the Mror. Bonecaster rituals allow them to shape and harden bone, and they often incorporate bones in weapons and armor. While they often use the bones of large creatures, it's also common for one of the bonesworn to carry a weapon or token that incorporates an ancestor's bone. The Jhorash'tar also work with other natural materials, including wood and stone. They have no equivalent to heavy armor, but can combine bone and leather to create armor that offers similar protection to a breastplate or scale mail.",
												"Many of the Jhorash'tar tribes wish for peace with the dwarves, and are working with the Frosthaven clans to reach an understanding. For the most part, these tribes don't want to live alongside Mror in their cities, but wish for their own recognized lands, and want the right to gather the bones of other orcs from across the holds. However, there are also tribes hungry for vengeance, driven by the cries of their fallen. Such tribes continue to engage in guerilla war and to spread terror however they can. As far as the Mror know, the orcs have had no contact with the Realm Below or the forces of Dyrrn\u2014but it's possible that a tribe has been touched by the Corruptor, and could emerge with unusual powers or even allied with aberrations.",
												"It's up to the DM whether the Jhorash'tar were involved in the destruction of Noldrunhold. Whatever the truth, Jhorash'tar tribes live safely in Noldrun territory, though they shun its cities."

Beyond wind and rain, tales speak of maelstroms that drag down even the largest vessels and masses of vegetation that rise from the water to entangle ships. All of these are very real threats, even more so because these dangers don't obey simple laws of wind and water. The Thunder Sea is home to a wide range of manifest zones, but the most powerful and numerous are those tied to Lamannia. The endless fury of the First Storm lashes ships with lightning and storm winds, and great maelstroms can pull a ship down into the Endless Ocean. The vast masses of vegetation are tied to the Twilight Forest, fueling unnatural growth that can latch onto a vessel and trap it in the sargassum. Though the influence of Lamannia is most strongly felt here, it's also possible to find an unexpected region of icebergs surrounding a manifest zone tied to Risia, boiling waters around a Fernian zone, or a region tied to Mabar where the shadows of sailors turn on the living.",
												"As any skilled ocean navigator can tell you, manifest zones are stable, physical locations. While a manifest zone's influence extends beyond its focal point, the worst storms of the Thunder Sea remain confined to specific areas. However, when the plane linked to a manifest zone is coterminous, its impact is dramatically enhanced, with storms extending beyond their usual radius and becoming far more powerful. This is why knowledge of the sea is vitally important for sailors; if you venture off the approved trade routes, you need to chart a course that will avoid the storms.",
												"Lamannian manifest zones often release elementals into Eberron. An eternal storm may contain air elementals, while water elementals can be found in the region around a maelstrom. Such elementals aren't intentionally cruel, but they're driven to express their elemental drives\u2014which often makes them dangerous to ships, which they perceive as alien invaders. Manifest zones can also produce dire beasts\u2014octopi, sharks, and other creatures of remarkable size.",
												"The merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed in more detail later in this section) serve as planar shepherds, tending manifest zones and helping to contain and mitigate their effects. This isn't absolute; the merfolk can't entirely disperse the power of the First Storm, or stop the growth of the Twilight Forest. But they seek to direct it, choosing to vent its power at times when there is minimal danger to innocents. Even when a region has especially bad storms due to a manifest zone, those storms could be far, far worse if the merfolk stopped performing their rituals or were driven away entirely."

Only the most seasoned navigators can plot a course through the Teeth without the help of a sahuagin guide; as a result, the islands have long been a haven for smugglers and pirates, preying on ships that founder on the Teeth.",

Any number of aquatic monstrosities may make a lair in the upper reaches of a spire. The sahuagin also often colonize the larger teeth, carving tunnels throughout a spire.

												"The greatest wonders of the Thunder Sea lie deep below the surface, all but unknown to the people of Khorvaire. The kar'lassa are enormous beasts\u2014miles in length\u2014half-buried and sleeping in the floor of the Thunder Sea. Not even the dragons of Argonnessen know the origin of the kar'lassa. They've slept since the beginning of recorded history, and are immune to all forms of divination magic. They could be creations of Khyber trapped before they could rise to the surface, or they could've been crafted by Eberron to guard against some future threat. Perhaps they are young progenitors, and when they finally wake, they will create new worlds.",
												"All that's known for certain is that the kar'lassa are massive, immortal monstrosities... and that each is bound to one of the planes. Each kar'lassa radiates the effects of a powerful manifest zone, extending up to 13 miles. The appearance of each kar'lassa reflects the plane they're tied to; the kar'lassa of Shavarath is a massive draconic beast with steel scales, while the kar'lassa of Fernia is a serpent of embers, water forever boiling against its skin. But the strangest aspect of the kar'lassa is their dreams. As described in chapter 5, when mortals dream, their spirits are usually drawn into Dal Quor. However, when the kar'lassa dream, {@i they don't dream in Dal Quor}. Instead, each kar'lassa dreams in the plane it's tied to\u2014and more wondrous yet, each great dreamer draws in the spirits of dreaming mortals. Any creature that dreams within 13 miles of a kar'lassa\u2014including unwary sailors passing above, if any are bold enough to go off the approved travel routes\u2014is pulled into the behemoth's dream, instead of dreaming in Dal Quor. So, for example, anyone who sleeps in the Dominion city of Hal'iri dreams their dreams in Irian. While dreaming in this way, a creature is only present as a spirit, and is immune to the negative environmental effects of that plane; so a mortal dreamer isn't hurt by the extreme heat of Fernia or the cold of Risia. Even if a dreamer dies in their dream from other causes, they just wake up. This is still {@i dreaming}; unless the dreamer is capable of lucid dreaming, they have little control of their actions and will likely only remember fragments of the experience. But if they do have tools or training that allow lucid dreaming (as with the {@i uul'kur} in chapter 7), this can be an interesting way to explore the planes.",

So what happens if a golin'dar dreams near a kar'lassa? These ancient primordial forces trump the work of Jhazaal Dhakaan, and the dar are pulled into the dream of the kar'lassa instead of to Dal Quor. However, all of the dream-tools crafted by the Kech Dhakaan\u2014the {@i kra'uul} and {@i uul'kur}\u2014function normally within the dream of a kar'lassa.",
														"What about kalashtar? Their connection to Dal Quor has been completely severed, but they do dream; when a kalashtar sleeps, they create dreams within their own mind, drawing on their memories and their quori spirit. However, if kalashtar find themselves within the range of a kar'lassa, they're pulled into its dream, as with the dar.",
														"The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are aware of how the kar'lassa influence the dreams of \"lesser\" races. Though the Protectorate hasn't yet captured any Dominion cities, they take great pride in their belief that because they don't sleep, they would be above the influence of the kar'lassa\u2014but this belief is wrong! It's true that elves trance rather than sleep, entering a deep meditative state much like a lucid dream, self-directed and untouched by the influence of either Dal Quor or a kalashtar's quori spirit. However, this process is physiologically similar to a human's dreams and can likewise be hijacked by the kar'lassa\u2014which would be a startling experience for an elf who's never dreamed before!"

												"Twelve kar'lassa have been discovered; one for each plane, aside from Dal Quor. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion have built their largest cities around eight of these great dreamers, though they've shunned the kar'lassa associated with Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the kar'lassa, and these substances are the fuel that drives their industry.",
												"The kar'lassa are a source of wonder, not monsters to be fought. To all tests, they appear to be immortal, and regenerate damage quickly. Spells such as {@spell stone to flesh} or {@spell disintegrate} only work on a tiny sliver of the kar'lassa, and even that's quickly restored. If one of these ancient slumbering monstrosities were to rise, it would be an almost unstoppable force of destruction, and destroy the Dominion city in the process. If one of these vast creatures emerged onto land, it could easily devastate cities without even meaning to.",
												"Titanic, unstoppable monstrosities that could threaten entire cities? That sounds a little like the tarrasque. And indeed, a simple way to introduce the tarrasque into Eberron is to present it as a kar'lassa rising from its slumber and threatening Sharn or Stormreach; just add the effects of a manifest zone to the region around it. The tarrasque is small for a kar'lassa; most are miles long, large enough that the sahuagin build cities around them. But it's possible a small kar'lassa might be the first to wake\u2014can the heroes who oppose it find a way to return it to its slumber before the others wake? If a DM chooses to explore this plotline, they'll have to decide the truth about the origins of the kar'lassa. If they're the children of Eberron, they might not want to destroy innocent creatures; they could have an important purpose as yet unfulfilled. On the other hand, if they're tools of the overlords or the Devourer, their rising will spell disaster."

Unlike the aboleths, they weren't created by a fiendish overlord and they don't serve any overlord; each kraken is a power in its own right. Krakens enjoy exercising their power and being worshipped by lesser creatures, and each one carved out a domain within the chaos of the Age of Demons. The binding of the overlords didn't adversely affect the krakens; however, many feared that the alliance that had formed to defeat the fiends might well turn its attention to them next, so they chose to go into hiding and sleep, waiting for an age when the champions of the Age of Demons were dead and the oceans were free.",
												"Krakens are spread across all of the oceans of Khorvaire. For the most part, they don't work together, in part to avoid the interest of Argonnessen. One kraken dominating an island of humanoids is of no concern to the dragons; an alliance of krakens is another story. However, multiple krakens have occasionally joined forces. Tens of thousands of years ago, five krakens devastated the previous civilization of the sahuagin of the Thunder Sea. Despite their power, they were eventually overcome; their remains are preserved in the city of Hal'shavar.",

										"Any sailor in Stormreach can tell you that the sahuagin worship the Devourer, who they call Shargon. But this is only part of the story. Sahuagin storm priests tell the common tale of how gods and demons fought in the first age, but their story doesn't end with the binding of the overlords. Once the fiends were defeated, the Sovereigns were determined to take their place and rule as tyrants. The sahuagin Sha'argon was a bold hunter and mighty warrior. He stalked the Sovereigns of the natural world, Arra'ai and Ba'alor. Sha'argon trapped them and consumed them, claiming their power as his own. The other Sovereigns were angry, but none could outwit Sha'argon, and he already had the power of two gods; so they fled to the world above and beyond, and to this day, they flee when the mighty hunter draws near.",
										"Sha'argon is the greatest of the gods. He sets the laws of the world, and they are cruel. Life is an endless struggle. The weak will perish in the storm or be consumed by the mighty. Those with cunning and courage can conquer the world itself, and the victor has the right to devour their vanquished foe. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion take these messages to heart. There is no foe they cannot conquer, no power they cannot claim. They have forged a dominion from the bones of krakens and the blood of the kar'lassa, an empire that will never end.",
										"If the Dominion wished to conquer the surface world, it could do so easily\u2014or so the sahuagin say. But to what end? Dryskins are pathetic barbarians, weak in both body and mind. The Eternal Dominion seeks grander prey, power worthy of Sha'argon. Some seek to consume the overlords; others plan the conquest of worlds beyond the world. Is this pure arrogance? Or can the Eternal Dominion gain mastery over reality itself?",

They possess an uncanny ability to rapidly adapt to changing pressure, and can ascend from the depths to the surface with no ill effects.

Their tough skin is as tough as leather armor, and their claws and teeth are deadly weapons.",
												"Human scholars are aware of the existence of sahuagin \"mutants,\" but few realize these aren't random mutations; they're the most visible products of a system that touches every sahuagin in the Dominion. From the moment they emerge from the spawning pools, young sahuagin undergo a regimen of diet, mystic rituals, and training that shapes them for their intended purpose. Sahuagin aren't clones, but a sahuagin warrior is imbued with strength and fury, and a sahuagin assassin is swift and deadly\u2014each by design. The sahuagin {@i create} their sorcerers. All Dominion sahuagin go through this initial process of shaping, and those who prove themselves worthy can go farther still, undergoing the rituals that produce champions such as the four-armed barons and the malenti. But these are just two examples of what the sahuagin magebreeders can achieve. The Claws of Sha'argon\u2014presented in chapter 8\u2014are another example of these magebred champions.",

Food brings great pleasure to the sahuagin, and they take pride both in the preparation of food and in the diversity of their diet; they farm both fish and flora, and hunt creatures that can't be farmed. Eating a locathah servant can either be an act of punishment or a great honor, depending on how the meal is prepared and consumed. Like the gnolls of the Znir Pact, it's common for a sahuagin to eat at least part of a fallen enemy, though this is more to seal the victory than to honor the spirit; you haven't truly defeated someone until you've consumed them. With this concept in mind, a DM may wish to give sahuagin NPCs advantage on saving throws against any sort of ingested poison and resistance to poison damage from such poisons."

This combines with a deep sense of cultural unity; what matters isn't that I defeat the foe, it's that {@i we} defeat it. So while sahuagin frequently compete with other sahuagin, seeking to advance in rank and earn evolution into a higher form, this is about strengthening the Dominion, not simply personal pride. Sahuagin don't seek to cheat their way into positions they believe they don't deserve. Similarly, weakness can't be tolerated, and they spare no time on sentimentality. The sahuagin are children of the Devourer: the point of storm and sickness is to cleanse weakness and strengthen those who survive. Anyone who grows too old or infirm should be challenged by those below them\u2014but this is rare in practice, for a sahuagin who realizes they can no longer perform their role will usually abdicate before they're challenged. It's common practice for a respected retiring leader to be consumed by their subordinates, so their spirit and skills will remain part of the Dominion. The sahuagin warrior who has grown too old to serve has no regrets about being consumed; they lived well, and now they give what strength they have left to nourish those who will come after them. A single life is fleeting; the Dominion is eternal, and your spirit lives on in your comrades who consume you. On the other hand, those seen as having no value\u2014who are best excised from the Dominion\u2014will simply be fed to the sharks.",

They're always looking for something to do, a challenge to overcome. However, this leaves them little time for abstract reflection, romance, or whimsy; life is war, and there's no time for poetry. Some would also say this limits innovation, and the Dominion is indeed slow to change its methods. Sahuagin are austere in their needs and desires, and don't seek comfort, luxury, or personal wealth. This isn't to say the sahuagin don't enjoy life or seek entertainment\u2014but rather, what drives the sahuagin is victory. They don't care for music or theater, but they enjoy gladiatorial combat and other forms of aggressive sport, such as public debates and arcane duels. They also love to eat, as this is a symbolic victory over whatever they're eating. Symbols of all kinds are important in sahuagin culture.

The eldritch energies sustaining the kar'lassa regenerate damage at a remarkable rate; the Dominion has been harvesting them for over a thousand years, and so far, they haven't come close to taxing these resources.",

In addition, the biomatter of each kar'lassa has unique properties and potential due to the plane it's tied to. The scales of Hal'shavar can be forged into powerful armor and weapons. The steam-breath of Hal'fer is an extremely powerful catalyst for evocation magic. The blood of Hal'kyth is an exceptional conduit for transmutation. These are just a few examples of the potential of the kar'lassa, and the Dominion itself is still discovering new uses for these resources.

At the heart of each temple lies the Or'lassa, the First Dreamer\u2014a sahuagin priest sustained by direct infusions of kar'lassa blood. These infusions cause physical mutations that often reflect the shape of the kar'lassa and the plane it is tied to, as well as keep the First Dreamer in a comatose state. Their spirit permanently resides in the kar'lassa dream, where they anchor a temple formed from their pure will. Dream priests are trained in lucid dreaming, and they use these temples as a base both for planar research and to maintain communication across the Dominion. While they reside in different planes, the temples are mystically linked through the kar'lassa, and rituals allow the priests to spiritually travel between the dream-temples, carrying messages to the other cities. And it's in the dream of Hal'iri that the spirits of the Or'lassa meet to coordinate the actions of the Dominion; this is the {@i Sha'lassa}, the Council of Dreams."

												"The Eternal Dominion is an advanced civilization that employs both arcane and divine magic as part of everyday life. It's generally more sophisticated than the Five Nations, but less advanced than Aerenal. Though the Dominion possesses capabilities beyond the Five Nations, its approaches can vary dramatically; for example, while the Dominion could generate {@spell continual flame}, light is largely provided by engineered bioluminescent coral. While the sahuagin employ all schools of magic\u2014generally influenced by the resources of that city's kar'lassa\u2014the Dominion's greatest advances are in alchemy, transmutation, and magebreeding.",
												"The Dominion has an exceptional talent for producing potions, allowing Dominion forces to temporarily boost their capabilities. But their technologies go far beyond temporary alterations, as the Dominion specializes in magebreeding all manner of creatures. The sahuagin themselves are carefully engineered to excel at the tasks chosen for them. In particular, the Dominion creates magewrights and sorcerers. This process isn't quick, taking place over the course of a sahuagin childhood, and including training as well as ongoing rituals and an unusual diet. The blood of the kar'lassa is used as a transformative catalyst, combined with the sahuagin principle, \"If you consume a thing you gain its power.\" As a result, creating a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer requires a young sahuagin to consume the flesh of a dragon\u2014so there's a concrete limit on how many of these sorcerers the sahuagin can create.",
												"In addition to these basic techniques that guide the evolution of a young sahuagin, the Dominion can also induce dramatic secondary mutations; many sahuagin are highly motivated by this prospect of attaining a higher form. The malenti and the four-armed barons are the best known of these, but they represent just a fraction of the Dominion's magebreeding abilities, and the DM can create additional mutants to suit the story. For example, the Claw of Sha'argon (presented in chapter 8) possesses a secondary mutation that's granted to powerful priests. These forms of ascension require rare resources and a significant amount of kar'lassa blood (drawn from a particular dreamer based on the type of transformation sought), and are only granted to sahuagin who prove themselves worthy.",
												"In addition to altering themselves, the sahuagin put many enhanced beasts to good use. Enhanced mantas are a common mount, possessing a swim speed of 90 feet. Mutated giant sharks and eels are used as larger vehicles, sometimes with seating areas formed upon their backs, other times with bony handles protruding from the beast's hide, allowing multiple riders to cling to the side. In place of warships, the Dominion fields dragon turtles with siege staffs embedded into their shells. The sahuagin have also created entirely new forms of life. The alchemists of Hal'kyth used the blood and biomatter of the kar'lassa to create plasmids: protean creatures similar to mimics, but capable of replicating the texture of inanimate objects as well as shape. Plasmids can be guards\u2014often serving as living doors to secure chambers\u2014but they're also a useful tool of industry, as a trained plasmid can itself become the tools a sahuagin artisan needs to perform its work.",
												"Skilled Dominion magewrights can cast {@spell fabricate} as a ritual, shaping raw materials into their desired form through magic. The Dominion also uses a substance called {@i korlass} (\"dream stone\"), formed from dreamer biomass, as an industrial material; it can be sculpted like clay, then fixed in its shape by a magewright ritual. {@i Korlass} has the strength of steel, with a texture similar to shell, though its appearance varies depending on which kar'lassa it's drawn from.",
												"When considering the abilities of Dominion sahuagin, it's likely that storm priests are Tempest clerics or Conquest paladins, while dream priests are Knowledge clerics. Sahuagin artificers are usually Alchemists, and the most common forms of arcane spellcasters are sorcerers (either Storm Sorcery or Draconic Bloodline) and magewrights. Sahaugin warriors are typically Battle Masters or Champions, but some embrace the blood frenzy of barbarians. Bards, druids, wizards, and warlocks aren't supported by the traditions of the Dominion and are rarely encountered."

Locathah laborers are now found in all of the great cities, and there are farming communities across the seafloor where locathah are ruled by sahuagin overseers.",

The Aereni have greater knowledge of the Dominion, and have seen its power in the long conflict with the Valraean Protectorate. They know about the kar'lassa, but because of the ongoing conflict, haven't actually explored its lands or visited its cities. So any adventurers who venture into the Dominion are pioneers, exploring unknown realms; academic institutions and dragonmarked houses alike will surely want to hear about their exploits.",

At this time, the Dominion has no interest in conquering the surface world, and they don't believe the dryskins pose any threat to their rule of the sea.

They enforce their territorial waters as a show of strength, demanding that travelers pay tolls and follow the established trade routes.",

In particular, Merrix d'Cannith has discovered that the sahuagin have a surplus of Siberys shards; the shards fall into the ocean, but the Dominion economy is based on the blood of the kar'lassa as opposed to dragonshards, and they have little use for them. As such, the Dominion has much to offer Cannith, and securing a steady supply of Siberys shards would strengthen Merrix's position within his house. The trick is finding something the Dominion wants in return, and he's currently pursuing this. Merrix (and other dryskins) are as yet unaware of the vast resources of the kar'lassa; if they were discovered, and Cannith found a way to harness them, it could change the face of industry in Khorvaire.",

The second is the Limited Amphibiousness trait possessed by both sahuagin and locathah\u2014a need for regular immersion in water can be a crippling requirement when an adventure leads to the Blade Desert. However, the sahuagin have developed a solution that solves both of these problems. While most people of the Five Nations have never {@i seen} a sahuagin, that doesn't mean they've never {@i met} one. Scholars who study the sahuagin know of malenti, sahuagin that are born indistinguishable from sea elves; the common belief is that this is a random mutation that occurs when sahuagin and sea elves live in close proximity. The sahuagin are happy to support this myth, because the truth is far more disturbing: Malenti aren't born, they're {@i made}. One of the sacred rituals of Sha'argon allows a sahuagin priest to guide a subject through ritually consuming a humanoid\u2014and in consuming the creature, the sahuagin {@i becomes} that creature, taking both their form and their powers.

While the Dominion has carried out a few targeted replacements to get malenti into influential positions, often malenti are just replacing people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: smugglers, fisherfolk, or pirates who strayed into Dominion territory. The purpose of this replacement isn't to take advantage of the character's previous life, but rather to place agents who can breathe on land and move freely without drawing attention.

The primary merfolk culture in the Thunder Sea is Karakala, whose members call themselves the Kalamer.",
										"The Thunder Sea has many strong manifest zones to Lamannia, the source of the endless storms that give the region its name. Nearly two centuries ago, an unusually strong convergence amplified the effects of the manifest zones. Both the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion were lashed by the power of Lamannia, and there were fears that the barrier between worlds could be permanently damaged. At the height of this disaster, Kalamer merfolk were pulled through from Lamannia; finding themselves without a means to return home, they used their rites and rituals to contain and repair the damage. These wild zones in the upper waters have always been a threat, and once it became clear that Karakala could mitigate the danger, both the sahuagin and sea elves agreed to give them freedom to travel in the upper waters, so long as they managed the manifest zones. Today, many Kalamer consider the Thunder Sea their new home, and travel from zone to zone, practicing their primal traditions. In a sense, they're nomadic gardeners, preserving the wild. As they're recognized as neutral by both the Dominion and the Protectorate, they often serve as messengers, couriers, and mediators, carrying news and negotiating on behalf of these powers\u2014an important role, as the sahuagin refuse to speak directly to the sea elves. The reach of Karakala extends along the southern coast of Khorvaire, and the arrival of a Kalamer bard is often a celebrated event in small Brelish or Zil fishing villages; more than once, they've managed to settle disputes between fisherfolk and the Dominion.",
										"Overall, Karakala is a neutral force, concerned above all with traveling between the manifest zones\u2014which they call the roots\u2014and performing the rituals that keep them stable. However, there are Kalamer pods who quietly despise those who bend nature for their own benefit\u2014dryskin, sahuagin, and sea elf alike\u2014and especially oppose the use of elemental binding; these have come to see House Lyrandar as their foes.

They prize manifest zones to Lamannia, and time spent at a Lamannian zone is a time of celebration. However, they travel to all manifest zones, and their rituals can contain the harmful effects of any manifest zone.",

Most merfolk seek to understand any threats they encounter, to see if they can find a way to coexist\u2014or failing that, to simply move past the danger. However, they can be dangerous foes when they're forced to act or encounter a true threat to the balance of nature.",

										"Long ago, the waters along the western coast of Aerenal were inhabited by peaceful locathah. The sahuagin of Sha'argon's Kingdom\u2014a predecessor to the Eternal Dominion\u2014steadily advanced toward Aerenal, conquering and assimilating the locathah. Concerned by the obvious aggression of the sahuagin, the Sibling Kings acted to secure the waters around Aerenal, establishing a buffer zone that would ensure that Sha'argon's Kingdom posed no direct threat. The line of Valraea was chosen, and through the power of the Undying Court, its nobles were physically transformed into {@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}, gaining iridescent skin and the ability to breathe beneath the water.",
										"Initially, the line of Valraea served as protectors and advisors, organizing the locathah and helping them construct superior defenses. Then the attacks began. The conflict slowly escalated; the harder the locathah fought, the more it drove sahuagin determination to claim the region. Valraean priests brought the full power of the Undying Court to bear against the attackers, and Sha'argon's Kingdom couldn't match their transcendent might. A generation later the sahuagin returned, and the elves retaliated, using the divine power of the Undying Court to seize the Sha'argon border fortresses. It was at this time\u2014when the region claimed included both sahuagin and locathah lands\u2014that the elves officially declared it the Valraean Protectorate. According to the proclamation, the Undying Court would protect all peoples of the Protectorate and the line of Valraea would provide them with guidance and security... all of which was a gentle way of saying that the people were now under Aereni rule and would be forced to embrace Aereni customs. While this decision was driven in part by a desire to ensure the island's security, it may have also been tied to the discovery of dragonshard deposits along the seabed\u2014both fallen Siberys shards and indications of deep Khyber shards.",
										"The next thousand years brought chaos, as the sahuagin\u2014first Sha'argon's Kingdom, then the Eternal Dominion\u2014continued to attack and the Valraean elves continued to retaliate by conquering additional sahuagin territories. But the power of the Undying Court is geographically limited. While clerics can draw on the power of the Court to cast spells anywhere in the world, the transcendent might that can repel dragons or defeat sahuagin armies has a limited range. When the elves pressed beyond that, they suffered terrible losses; and yet, the Dominion couldn't challenge the elves within the Court's sphere of influence. This began a long stalemate that continues to this day. The Eternal Dominion has launched numerous attacks over the last few centuries, testing the power of the Undying Court, but thus far, the might of the deathless has been sufficient to repel every sahuagin assault.",

												"Most subjects of the Valraean Protectorate are locathah and sahuagin; despite this, the Protectorate is modeled after Aereni society in many ways. In Aerenal, any elf can prove themselves worthy of joining the noble line. In the Protectorate, subjects likewise strive to prove their worth\u2014but in this case, they seek to be worthy of {@i serving} the elves of the noble line. Valraean subjects are raised to believe that all elves are semidivine beings. They're ancient and wise, masters of powerful magic and remarkable skills... and most importantly, only elves can ascend to join the Undying Court.",
												"The sea elves of the line of Valraea live in the midst of this enforced adulation. They're idolized and adored from birth, and have been playing the role of divine guardians and guides for so long that many have come to believe it: they {@i were} shaped by the Undying Court to be the guardians of the sea, and they do stand above their adoring subjects. But while the Valraean sea elves are often arrogant and overconfident, they generally strive to live up to that vision, to protect anyone in their charge, to be the noble and gracious rulers that (most of) their subjects imagine them to be. They aren't petty tyrants; they believe in ensuring the safety and security of their people\u2014but they also feel no qualms about the fact that their subjects are ultimately trapped in their lives, with all positions of power held by sea elves. They consider their privilege logical and natural; and so do the overwhelming majority of Valraean subjects, who believe the elves, with their long lives and deathless ancestors, are more capable than other mortals could ever be with their fleeting lifespans.",
												"Meanwhile, Valraean subjects believe they too are elevated above all outsiders, lower than the elves, but still blessed to receive the guidance of the elves and the living (or rather, deathless) gods of the Undying Court. And most subjects strive to prove themselves worthy of this blessing. All subjects of the Protectorate receive an education and learn trades. Its people engage in simple industry that no Aereni elf wants to dirty their hands with, as well as laboring to provide an important source of dragonshards for the mainland. In all of this, Valraeans are generally honest and industrious, trying to emulate the Aereni and perfect their skills; but they're taught that they'll never be as gifted as elves, since an Aereni elf spends an entire locathah lifetime in just their initial studies. This reflects the cornerstone of Valraean culture, which is, boiled down, that {@i elves are glorious and better at everything than you}. As a Valraean you're just lucky to be near elves, to have their guidance and protection. It's your duty to honor the Undying Court, because without it, you would be torn apart by the vicious sahuagin in the cruel world outside the Protectorate. And while no non-elf has ever proven worthy to join the Undying Court\u2014how could they, with a paltry century to perfect their skills\u2014maybe, just {@i maybe}, if you keep working hard enough and become the best person you can be, you might be the first.",
												"While many members of the line of Valraea believe their own propaganda, the simple truth is that the benevolent Protectorate is an oppressive regime, sometimes brutally so. The line of Valraea has long worked to stamp out all traces of the native cultures, replacing the local languages with Elvish and eliminating the locathah religion. Few subjects publicly challenge elven rule, but those who do are quickly silenced. But despite these efforts, there are those among the masses who resist the Valraean propaganda and seek to reclaim and preserve their ancient traditions. Rebel sahuagin may work with malenti and support Dominion espionage. The locathah have a more difficult path, as for their kind, life in the Dominion would be even worse than in the Protectorate. But the locathah resistance still clings to hope, believing that as long as they are free in their hearts, they may yet find a way to overthrow all of the tyrants.",
												"Valraean subjects are split into houses, each of which includes members of multiple species; this, in part, serves to deemphasize the importance of direct family. Each house has a patron in the Undying Court. They are taught to idolize this patron and believe that it personally protects them; in some cases this may actually be true, though many deathless councilors pay no attention to their Valraean devotees. Regardless, the Valraeans' ongoing adoration of the Undying Court provides a valuable source of positive energy for the Court itself.",
												"Valraean fashion largely mirrors that of Aerenal, though using different materials. Fine leather takes the place of cloth, and Valraeans generally wear less clothing than their counterparts on the surface. Coral, ivory, and bloodvines (described in Tools and Traditions) are often used as ornaments. As in Aerenal, masks are important accessories; elves wear full face masks, while accomplished non-elves generally wear masks that cover their lower faces.",
												"All subjects of the Protectorate speak Elvish. This replaces Aquan among locathah and Sahuagin among sahuagin. Those who dream of resistance work to preserve their ancestral languages, but they're not spoken where elves can overhear them."

The Protectorate includes settlements along the shelf in the upper water and on the ocean floor.",

The common populace of the Protectorate includes magewrights and adepts, with a handful of gifted wizards.

The sea elves are encouraged to think of themselves as divine champions, and many do become clerics or paladins. Arcane spellcasters are typically wizards, and the strengths of the Protectorate are divination, abjuration, and necromancy. There are also a handful of artificers among the line. While the power of the Undying Court defends the region, the line of Valraea maintains the many wards and monitors the seas for sahuagin activity, or any other threat that might arise.",
												"The artisans of the Protectorate work with the exotic woods of Aerenal, but they use other exotic materials as well. Leather is the primary material used in clothing, both fine, thin leather for simple fashions, and tougher hides for armor. Bone-coral is a form of coral that is artificially grown and hardened using arcane techniques, used for everything from buildings to ornaments. Bloodvines are an aquatic form of Aereni livewood; they draw sustenance from any creature in contact with them (though not so much as to be noticeable in any way) and thus remain alive, even when shaped into ornaments or armor.",
												"The artificers of the line of Valraea are curious about the arcane potential of kar'lassa biomatter\u2014the foundation of Dominion arcane magic\u2014and are always eager to acquire it. Valraean sahuagin don't have access to the magebreeding and alchemical techniques of the Eternal Dominion; as a result, they develop as any other creatures would, instead of being guided down a particular path. This also means the Protectorate doesn't have any of the secondary mutants\u2014such as barons, malenti, and Claws of Sha'argon\u2014found in the Dominion."

They are eternal, and with few exceptions, unchanging. Eberron is the Material Plane, where these concepts come together and interact. It's a world that feels the passage of time, where life can change and evolve. The planes of Eberron are archetypal ideas. The precise details can change, but there's always been war in Shavarath, and always will be; that's what Shavarath is.",

A plane's universal properties can often be felt on Eberron itself; one of the most common effects of manifest zones is to extend one or more of that plane's universal properties into the Material Plane, sometimes reliably, other times unpredictably. The section for each plane presents a list of universal effects that affect that entire plane; these generally apply to all creatures within that plane.",

For spells and similar effects that target oneself or require concentration, the duration is calculated based on the flow of time the caster is currently experiencing. If a spell doesn't require concentration and is cast on a target other than self (for example, a {@spell geas} spell), its duration is based on the target's current plane and time."

														"A dragon rains fire down on a platoon of soldiers in Shavarath. Cheering crowds throng the streets of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Dragon, soldiers, crowds\u2014none of these things are truly real. When you dream that you're taking a test at Arcanix, the sarcastic professor and mocking students aren't fully sentient spirits; they're manifestations of Dal Quor, created for that scene, and as soon as you wake, they'll vanish. These creatures can appear to be sentient, and you might be able to have a conversation with soldiers in Shavarath\u2014but they won't have anything to say that you couldn't imagine coming out of the mouth of an extra in a war movie. As a general rule, manifestations can't leave the layers of the planes that they're in, and like dreams, they usually don't persist indefinitely; when their purpose is served, they simply evaporate until they're needed again. Very rarely, a manifestation might develop a more independent, sentient existence\u2014like the drifters of Dal Quor\u2014though they're generally still bound to their plane of origin and unable to deviate from their central purpose.",
														"Manifestations vary by plane; in Dal Quor they're called figments, while in Shavarath, they're conscripts. In some planes, the manifestations are formed from the soul-stuff of mortals, while in others they're entirely imaginary. A plane never runs out of the potential for manifestations, but these creatures typically follow the internal logic of a scene. If you fight a dragon in Shavarath, it feels just like fighting an actual dragon, and when you kill it, it seems dead and you can enjoy your victory. However, if you return a day later, there's no sign of the corpse, and instead, there's a new dragon in the sky.",
														"Some planes don't have manifestations of creatures, because the ideas they represent don't need them. Instead, these planes generally rely on native mortals to make up the supporting cast. So while Shavarath needs a constant churn of conscripts in battle, and Dal Quor creates figments to flesh out mortal dreams, other planes\u2014Dolurrh, Fernia, Lamannia, and Syrania\u2014don't create manifestations. For example, Lamannia needs mortal beasts to tell its story; birth, growth, and even death are part of its concept, and reflecting that requires a mortal population."

The name \"immortal\" doesn't mean \"unkillable\"\u2014they can indeed be killed (as discussed in the \"Killing Immortals\" sidebar). While immortals don't show the effects of age, some have a limited lifespan and can die a natural death as well. However, their {@i essence} is immortal and their numbers remain constant.",
														"Most immortals don't care about Eberron. Many consider Eberron to be an unfinished experiment, while their realm is the finished, perfected work of the Progenitors. Others simply believe in their purpose to the exclusion of all other things; to the angel of Shavarath, the eternal battle is the single most important struggle in the multiverse, and leaving their post for even an instant could give the enemy an advantage. So most immortals aren't concerned with the fates of mortals or their civilizations; of course mortals may die, that's their most defining feature. An angel has seen many human civilizations rise and fall\u2014what's one more? While there are a few exceptions\u2014immortals who chose to dwell on Eberron, whether to prey on mortals, observe them, or assist them\u2014immortals are generally bound to their planes, and your problems are not their problems.",
														"Immortals don't reproduce as mortal creatures do; if they're killed, their spiritual essence is instead reabsorbed into the plane and eventually reassembled. For example, in Shavarath, angels and devils are constantly being killed, but they're just as quickly being reborn to fight again. Immortals are each born as embodiments of specific ideas and don't choose their path; they're already mature, possessing their full abilities and knowledge, and imbued with an absolute understanding of their purpose. So while immortals possess great power, they lack the potential of mortals to grow and evolve, and find the idea of questioning their beliefs or straying from their purpose to be inconceivable.",

Immortals that play a particularly significant role within a plane often return with their memories and personality intact; physical destruction is no more than a short trip to the penalty box. Lesser immortals may return with the same abilities, but with a new appearance, memories, or personality. The number of immortals remains the same, but it's a new incarnation of the idea. The only way to permanently eliminate an immortal is to somehow contain or redirect its spiritual essence; this is why the Silver Flame bound the overlords instead of destroying them.",
																"While immortals can't be destroyed, it's possible that the manner of a creature's death, or circumstances that follow, could delay the return of a particular immortal, or force it to return as a new incarnation instead of retaining its memories. The DM could choose to make these general rules for a type of creature\u2014perhaps immortals from Shavarath return in 24 hours if they're killed on Shavarath, but it takes 6 months for them to return if they're killed on Eberron. Or it could be extremely specific: the devil Hashtorak returns within a day of his death, but if he's killed with the Spear of Miron he'll be banished for ten years."

														"There are exceptions to all rules, of course. The kalashtar exist because a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar. Likewise, radiant idols are angels of Syrania that were corrupted by their time on the Material Plane and desired mortal adoration. But these examples are vanishingly rare. Sometimes it's because the unusual immortal is born embodying a unique perspective on the usual concept; this is essentially a mutation, as opposed to a choice. In other cases, an outside force might change or corrupt the immortal's fundamental nature. And rarely, an immortal might have an unusual sense of identity and the ability to choose.",
														"If an immortal changes in a way that alters its core concept, this is often accompanied by a physical transformation, such as a corrupted angel becoming a radiant idol, thus losing its ability to fly. Immortals may be able to increase their abilities by absorbing other immortals, acquiring artifacts, or through other means unique to their plane. They simply don't grow or gain experience through time alone; after all, some of them are as old as the universe itself, and in the absence of a dramatic cause, they're utterly unchanging."

With this in mind, the planes of Eberron are divided into layers\u2014distinct environments or realms that aren't bound by the laws of physical space nor physically connected. These layers can be tiny, seemingly infinite, or anything in between. A desert may wrap back upon itself, the alleys in a city could twist in impossible ways to always return you to the main square, or you could come to an absolute edge, where everything falls away into an endless void.",
												"Many scholars\u2014including Dorius Alyre ir'Korran in his celebrated {@i Planar Codex}\u2014describe the layers of a plane as a stack; however, the planes of Eberron aren't physically arranged in a particular order, and there's no concept of a top or bottom layer. Instead, each layer explores a different facet of the core concept that defines the plane. Lamannia is the Plane of Nature, and each layer showcases a particular environment\u2014there's an endless ocean, a vast forest, a volcano forever on the edge of erupting. Shavarath is the Plane of War, and each layer contains a different aspect of war\u2014a bitter siege, a bloody melee, a lingering guerilla conflict. Some planes have a core layer that serves as the heart of the plane, such as the Amaranthine Cities of Mabar and Irian. But the layers of Lamannia are all equal in importance.",
												"While they aren't stacked, most planes have layers bound by a reliable set of connections. The shape of these connections varies based on the plane. Some are obvious: a massive door sitting in the desert, a pool that reflects a scene from another layer. Others are more subtle; if you come upon an island while sailing on the Endless Ocean of Lamannia and you walk inland, you'll find that the island is a completely different layer\u2014and when you turn around, the ocean is no longer behind you. A portal doesn't have to be physical at all; in Thelanis, you can travel to a new layer by acting out the elements of a new story.",
												"This chapter provides examples of notable layers for each plane, but these are only a sampling. Just as ideas have no limits, there are no limits on the number of layers a plane can contain. In developing or describing a layer to fit your story, keep the core concept of the plane in mind. What differentiates the vast fortress citadel of Irian's Amaranthine City from a fortress in Shavarath? A fortress in Shavarath is about war; the stones are worn, and there's a scent of blood and smoke in the air. In Irian, the fortress is a symbol of hope, of an empire on the rise; it's bright, clean, and may have never seen an actual battle. So while the layers of two planes might initially sound similar, look back to the core concept and consider how that's reflected in each layer."

On the other hand, when a plane is {@i remote}, its power fades; since the planes are always influencing the Material in subtle ways, their absence impacts the world as strongly as their presence does. Multiple planes can be coterminous at the same time; these planar conjunctions are often related to the interactions of the moons, and characters proficient in Arcana can usually work out upcoming conjunctions.",

Other DMs might prefer to have concretely established cycles, which can add their own interesting flavor to an adventure. For example, Mabar is always coterminous on the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice, a time known as Long Shadows. On these nights, friends and family gather together and keep lights burning through the night. With this in mind, this chapter does discuss the traditional cycle of each plane, when it's reliably coterminous or remote\u2014just remember the cycles are there to enhance your story, not limit it!"

										"Returning life to the dead isn't a reliable service in Eberron. Many characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, from clerics to adepts of House Jorasco. But just because a spell {@i can} be cast doesn't mean that it {@i should} be cast... or that it will work if it does. The first and simplest limitation is time. The longer a spirit remains in Dolurrh, the more it falls under the sway of ennui. Any spell that returns life to the dead requires the spirit to {@i want} to return. Once the shade becomes a husk, it can no longer make that decision, and thus can't be raised or reincarnated. Most religions maintain that this happens because the true soul has moved on to a higher level of existence; who wants to be pulled back from a union with the Sovereigns? So you only have about a week or two\u2014depending on the strength of the target's will\u2014to pull them back. But even before that time, a spirit might choose not to return. What do they have to live for? Is it worth fighting the lulling ennui of Dolurrh?",
										"The second limitation is risk. Even if a spell is successful, Jorasco remains rightly concerned about whether that person is {@i supposed} to come back, or if it's their time to die\u2014for if it's the latter, a marut may appear to challenge any resurrection. This is extraordinarily rare, but in part, that's because healers perform an {@spell augury} ritual beforehand and refuse to raise someone if there's a risk. Even if a marut doesn't intervene, there's a risk the resurrection could go poorly if Dolurrh is coterminous, perhaps calling back other spirits in addition to\u2014or instead of\u2014the person being brought back to life.",
										"The final limitation is the direct intervention of a higher power. The Queen of the Dead might crystallize a shade and prevent it from being restored, or catch a spirit that's about to be restored and set a price on its passage; a few examples are given on the Cost of a Life table. How long does the beneficiary have to settle their account? A day, a year, a lifetime? It's also said that the Keeper can snatch souls before they even reach Dolurrh; if this myth is true, such souls can only be recovered from the Lair of the Keeper in the Demon Wastes. The Keeper itself may or may not be there, but it's certainly the abode of a powerful dracolich!",
										"The flip side of direct intervention is that the Queen of the Dead (or another powerful entity) might offer to return a shade to life\u2014for a price. This is a way to bring a low-level character back to life, despite their friends being unable to afford resurrection. {@table The Cost of a Life|ExploringEberron} table provides ideas.",
										"If all else fails, there's one way you can always bring someone to life: go to Dolurrh, find their shade, and drag it back out to the Material Plane. It's simple\u2014all you need to do is to locate a single soul in the endless Catacombs (perhaps with the help of a native guide, records in the Vault of Memories, or powerful divination magic), evade Dolurrh's many guardians, and return to Eberron with the soul in tow. If you succeed, the victim receives a new body, just as if you'd cast {@spell true resurrection}; and while Dolurrh's defenders will try to stop you from leaving, they won't interfere once you return to Eberron. It's theoretically possible to restore a husk in this way as well, though the resurrected husk generally won't regain its lost memories, even though it might learn new skills. As a result, it wouldn't do any good to bring back the Tairnadal ancestors or Galifar I; you could bring a {@i body} back to life, but it's not the original person in any meaningful way. This is why the Queen of the Dead (and perhaps the Keeper) preserves certain shades from decay\u2014so that they might one day be restored, even after thousands of years."

This can take many forms; new mephits spring out of open flame, while the dao craft new azers out of bronze.

At any moment in Fernia, one of the efreet is hosting a grand celebration.

Unlike the embers, who aren't fully conscious or aware of the memories they hold, lumi are sentient creatures, each with a unique identity, though their sparks give them fragments of many mortal lives.

Between the strange flow of time and unusual environments, this can lead to dramatic surges in populations or sudden extinctions.

The grand city of Cornerstone may be the seat of the brutal Concordance of Iron today, and the Enlightened Lyceum League a month later. These changes are astonishingly fast, but they aren't instant; there are usually at least a few days of chaotic transition and revolution in between a change. The scope of a community won't change\u2014Cornerstone is always a metropolis, while Turn is always a village\u2014but the structures of the community shift. Under the Concordance of Iron, Cornerstone is filled with brutalist iron towers, while the Cornerstone of the Lyceum League is filled with slender glass spires.",

Red slaadi are always red toad-like creatures that implant eggs, but the Lyceum slaadi might be tall and slender, while the Concordance slaadi are squat and heavy. Kythri's influence can also cause slaadi to change color. So slaadi follow standard methods for creating particular colors\u2014a blue slaad infects creatures with chaos phage, creating red or green slaadi\u2014but a green slaad could go to sleep one night and wake up as a death slaad, and vice versa. In a culture like the Concordance, that means leadership frequently changes, because it's based on color, not personality.",

According to the githzerai, when the daelkyr completed their work on Eberron, they wiped the gith world from existence and created a new reality. If this is true, they may have done this countless times... and if they break the Gatekeeper seals, they could do it again. What the githzerai ultimately hope to achieve is to reassert their reality onto the Material Plane.",

Over time, the fragment's properties from its previous plane are replaced by the properties of Mabar. Once the fragment acquires the last property in this process, the Hunger of Mabar, it's fully assimilated into the Endless Night as a new symbol of entropy and despair. Mortal inhabitants of the fragment are typically transformed into shadows or other forms of undead, while immortals might become yugoloths, or twisted into dark mockeries of their former selves. The conversion is slow and inevitable, and the Dark Powers of Mabar don't have to take any action\u2014but regardless, most enjoy tormenting the fragments. Undead prey on the edges of fragments besieged by the Bone King, and yugoloth soldiers raid fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows.",

Now it drifts through an icy void, grand windows shattered and books fallen from their shelves. Shadows of sages clutch at books with insubstantial fingers, never able to turn a page. The angelic librarians have become tormented spirits who hunger for knowledge, draining the memories from any creature unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp.",

The darkness can't be stopped, as it's part of the machinery of reality\u2014the Endless Night consumes and fragments are lost. Those pulled into the darkness can fight against it, but the ultimate outcome is inevitable. Were it not for Irian, Mabar would eventually consume everything. But as the Night consumes, the Dawn restores, and so balance is ultimately maintained.",
												"The process of consumption is slow and ongoing, and there are always multiple fragments in the Hinterlands. It may take Mabar months, years, or even centuries to consume a fragment. As the properties are replaced, the landscape of the fragment changes to reflect it. In a former fragment of Lamannia, the vegetation around the borders begins to wilt. Creatures become sickly, and totems may not be seen at all, or they might be terrifying shadows, killing the grass they walk on.",
												"Mabar typically targets other planes, but it can claim pieces of the Material Plane as well. This initial effect is reminiscent of the Mourning; gray fog rolls over the region that's affected, and all that's caught within the fog is lost. However, Mabar typically claims a region the size of a town, or perhaps a county; it's never been known to claim an entire country. Typically the fog fades within a day, leaving a barren region stripped of vegetation and structures. Mabar's power is such that it also consumes the memories of the place; most mortals simply forget that the affected region ever was anything but barren, and forget the people consumed in the process. This process isn't perfect or absolute, but when contradictory information is presented, people instinctively try to rationalize it. Maybe they heard a story about the lost town? The uncle who lived in that town? Didn't he die in the war? In short, player characters might realize something is wrong, but be unable to convince others of it. Because of this magical effect and the fact that it happens so rarely, the common people of Khorvaire don't know about this aspect of Mabar. But if a group of strong-willed player characters investigates it, they might be able to discover the cause of lost colonies and other mysteries."

Likewise, this connection to Mabar has a corrupting effect that pulls most intelligent undead toward evil alignments.

The second question is how long the fragment has been under siege. To what degree does it retain its original flavor, and how much has the influence of Mabar oventaken it? The final question is which of the Dark Powers has claimed it\u2014and why? What is it about this region that draws it towards a Dark Power's domain? The Empress of Shadows looks for places that shine too brightly\u2014places that bask in their achievements, sure their glory will never fade. The Bone King claims fragments where commoners suffer or where rulers turn to tyranny; there are a few Karrnathi fragments in his domain, though it can be hard to tell how close they are to being subsumed. The Queen of All Tears seeks the places where terrible tragedies have occurred, forcing the inhabitants to forever dwell in these moments of misery. With fragments of the outer planes, it's more a question of reshaping the plance to fit these stories.

However, such regions are also often powerful sources of negative energy. Mabaran zones often possess the Necrotic Power universal property, and there are epic rituals and eldritch machines that require a Mabaran manifest zone. The Odakyr Rites that create Karrnathi undead are an example of this, and the Karrnathi city of Atur is built on a Mabaran zone. This often has a curious synergy: if the negative energy of a Mabaran manifest zone is regularly channeled into rituals or spells, it prevents that energy from spreading disease or killing vegetation. {@i In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy}, Jolan Hass Holan asserts that the plagues and famines Karrnath suffered early in the war were due to the Seekers who normally tended those zones being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns\u2014which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace necromancy to counter the effects of those famines.",

The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, \"Why continue to fight? Why not just leave the struggle and do something\u2014anything\u2014else?\" In particular, it's common for mortals to see the vast resources the celestials devote to the war and protest, \"Why don't you help us? You claim to be the Legion of Justice, but innocent people are dying in Thaliost while you fight this meaningless war!\"",

Tyranny. Cruelty. The war in Shavarath is a visible symbol of the balance of power between these forces, and when it shifts in Shavarath, the immortals believe it shifts everywhere. Fallen devils will be reborn. New airships will replace those destroyed. But every tiny victory\u2014every demon defeated, every foot advanced in Nullius Terram\u2014strengthens the forces of justice everywhere. Each angel knows they will never win a truly decisive victory, but as long as they fight, they can at least hold the line.",

Even a sympathetic angel sees a mortal as a snowflake: unique, beautiful, but gone in a moment (and sooner if you touch it). The angels fought long before today's mortal civilizations existed, and if they hadn't held this line for countless eons, the Material Plane would be overrun by chaos and cruelty.",

A sword wraith has the appearance of its mortal source and some of the memories, but it's only an echo of the mortal, much like the traces of memory that allow you to speak with dead. Sword wraiths reconcile their memories with the war within the layer. If there's a sword wraith of Karrn the Conqueror commanding troops in Nullius Terram, he believes that he's fighting for Karrnath and can't be convinced otherwise; after all, he's only a memory, and there are limits to his ability to reason.",

These members of the supporting cast exist because the story needs them to exist, and they have a specific role to play. While most supporting cast are fey, any creature can appear if the story requires it. A pack of wolves? An angry giant? A white horse that appears just when it's needed? Anything is possible.",
												"Supporting cast generally use the standard stat blocks for each creature, though they might be considered fey instead of other creature types. These creatures don't think of themselves as manifestations; it's simply that they have no real depth, no desires other than the drives they need to fill their role in the story, and no care for the passage of time. The sprite never gets bored of its song, and it never stops to question anything about its existence.",
												"The supporting cast reflects the fact that the stories of Thelanis don't change. The hungry giant will always be guarding the well. If adventurers defeat the giant, they're the heroes of the hour and it feels like a triumph; but if they return to the barony at a later date, the giant will be back\u2014or at least, a remarkably similar giant\u2014and it won't remember them or acknowledge their previous victory. As a general rule, supporting cast can't abandon their posts or leave their layers.",
												"However, more than the manifestations of other planes, the supporting cast of Thelanis can evolve. When an anchor baron gives the white horse to an adventurer, it becomes a mortal horse and they can ride it home. Supporting cast that drift into manifest zones become mortal fey, dwelling in the zone until they die. A supporting cast member can also evolve by gaining a greater role in the story. An individual sprite doesn't even have a name, but if the adventureres convince the sprite to help them, and it plays a critical role in their defeat of the giant at the well, it's no longer a nameless sprice; it's Clever Jack, or whatever name they gave it. If a manifestation becomes mortal, it can go anywhere it likes, even leaving its layer and following the adventureres back to Eberron... but if it dies, it's gone forever. On the other hand, a manifestation can evolve to become a greater fey; if this happens, it remains immortal, and it's still tied to its story, just with a bigger role and more personality."

												"There are two types of mortals in Thelanis. The first are the supporting cast that have become real and split off from their original stories. The second are natural-born mortals who do have their own cultures and cities; chief among these are the eladrin, who dwell in the feyspires of the Moonlit Vale. Each spire is ruled by an archfey, and each has a distinct story that shapes the personality of the local eladrin. The eladrin aren't as bound by story as other fey, but the magic of the plane encourages a deep devotion to their spire and their ruler. They hunt, they hold revels, they serve their ruler in the intrigues of the Moon Court; it rarely occurs to them that there could be more to life. However, they're indeed mortals; they fall in love, they have children, they are born, and they die. If an eladrin leaves their spire\u2014whether to roam across Thelanis or into Eberron\u2014they often gain a greater appreciation of the passage of time. Living among mortals in a mundane world can be a hard transition for an eladrin; compared to the wonders of the Faerie Court, there is little fey beauty in Khorvaire. The longer an eladrin lives in the mortal world, the more mortal it becomes; this is why eladrin player characters are considered humanoids (and elves) rather than fey.",
												"For the eladrin of Thelanis, the seasonal aspect remains a statement of their current mood and nature. However, seasons are also used as a political statement, reflecting a degree of support for that season in the Moon Court; there may be times when an eladrin will resist assuming a particular aspect so as not to offend a host.",
												"The eladrin are the most common mortals in the layer, but there are also a handful of mortals who have been drawn in from Eberron\u2014the gnomes of Pylas Pyrial, wandering Greensingers, mortals personally chosen by one of the archfey, or creatures who accidentally wandered through manifest zones and are trying to find their way home."

Sometimes the protagonist of the story appears as a greater fey; in the case of the Sleeping Prince, perhaps the adventurers can actually meet the clever Woodcutter's Daughter. However, often the role of protagonist is left for the adventurers to fill; in Thelanis, {@i they} are the ones who must wake the Sleeping Prince.",

They want to achieve things within their story, but few have any thoughts or desires that go beyond Thelanis. However, it's possible for them to go wherever they want. A greater fey could establish its own domain in a manifest zone tied to Thelanis, or be found selling strange trinkets in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania. When greater fey do leave Thelanis, they generally seek to create their own stories; they still want to be part of a narrative that makes sense to them.",

A greater dryad might be able to see through all of the trees in the manifest zone she calls home, and to control its beasts. This isn't represented by a spell, as she couldn't control beasts in other places; it's simply part of the story.",

A greater dryad could be immune to fire unless someone knows her name, at which point she is vulnerable to it.

Where greater fey may be tied to a single story, most archfey have inspired countless tales\u2014often as the antagonist, though they can also be benevolent. The Lady in Shadow is the archetype of the mighty witch who lives apart from society, whose anger can bring a terrible curse. She's the villain of the Sleeping Prince, but she also curses those who steal from her secret garden, and may have advice for those who approach her carefully and with gifts. In some cases, stories refer to the archfey by name. When something goes missing in the Five Nations, people in Eberron know the Forgotten Prince stole it; his story is explored in chapter 8. Other archfey inspire tales, but those stories are seen through a local lens. The Lady in Shadow set the story of the Sleeping Prince in motion long ago, but in Eberron, the villain of the story is Lady Narathun, or Hezhaal the dirge singer, or Sora Katra. This is fine with the Lady in Shadow; she doesn't need mortals to know her name.",

Some recruit agents directly, working with Greensingers or training warlocks or other emissaries; an archfey could serve as an immortal group patron for a group of adventurers. Typically, an archfey wants its agents to take actions relating to its story; the Forgotten Prince charges his agents to steal secrets and unloved things. Others don't want agents; they want mortals to reenact their stories, as in many versions of the Sleeping Prince. Hezhaal the dirge singer really did curse the marhu's son long ago, and Sora Katra is another real person who just happens to resemble the Lady in Shadow in some ways. Neither Katra nor Hezhaal knowingly served the Lady in Shadow\u2014but she may have secretly aided them, or placed gifts or obstacles in their paths that might make them reenact the stories, unknowingly becoming avatars of the archfey. Archfey can't be permanently killed; as long as their stories are told, the archfey will reform. However, this usually involves a greater fey being promoted to fill the role; the archfey still exists, but they aren't exactly the same as the one that came before.",

It's always night here, and the moon Rhaan radiates bright light, always seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon doesn't move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court is covered in snow, while in spring, it's in brilliant flower. This has nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to do with the intrigues of the Palace of the Moon; the current season indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant. This is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: {@i things change}. The baronies are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the four seasons are the story Thelanis tells itself.",

There are many natural displays of illusion\u2014streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The beasts of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual colors and patterns; while many use standard stat blocks, sentient beasts might use the statistics for Valenar beasts from {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} (though these aren't in any way related to the Tairnadal). The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have advantage on foraging checks... though hunting without permission may incur the wrath of the local fey.",

The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among the fey of the Moon Court, and those who dwell within the palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer. At the apex of each season\u2014perhaps a strangely arbitrary declaration in a realm with such a casual relationship to time\u2014the fey of the ruling season host a grand revel, which draws archfey from all throughout the plane; this is a moment when intrigues bloom and stories are shaped, a time for duels and grand declarations.",

Many feyspires serve as planar beachheads; they are tied to specific manifest zones in Eberron, and when the time is right, they can slip into Eberron for a short time. Usually the feyspires are hidden by powerful illusions during these times, but there are stories of people stumbling into magical cities that are gone the next day.

Folly contains a charming village and a number of threats\u2014a dragon, a giant\u2014that can't be defeated with weapons alone. However, skill checks can be used to achieve things that might seem impossible in reality. For example, each Persuasion or Deception check could be used to convince the dragon to eat its own hoard, with each successful check reducing its hit points until it bursts.

Gateway zones always share the general environment of the layer they are connected to, though it's rarely obvious when this passage occurs, and it may take time for travelers to realize they have crossed over. However, there are always signs of a gateway\u2014circles of mushrooms, strange patterns of vegetation, eerie lights, or faint, unearthly music the adventurers must follow. Gateways typically only activate at certain times\u2014often when the moon Rhaan is full\u2014and even then, there's usually something that must be done that violates a known superstition. If you stay on the path in the forest, you won't stumble into the Endless Weald. But if you follow the ghostly music, or chase the silvery deer? That's on you.",
												"Other manifest zones reflect the properties and influence of Thelanis without allowing passage between worlds. Zones with the Enchanted Realm property are much sought after by House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Zones with Storybook Logic break the rules of reality in specific ways; the Grove of Promises is a clearing that holds an old stone fountain. Stories from the nearby village say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain, you must keep your word\u2014and if you are false, you'll sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove... will you?",

The feyspires mentioned earlier are an example of this, but a beachhead can be any unusual location\u2014sure to be a local legend, but rarely be found by those searching for it, only uncovered by chance. There's a tale in the Mror Holds of the Tomb of the Forgotten King, found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in an ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, guardians patrol the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others, there are deadly traps.

From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn't evil or destructive. It's part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Irian brings life, Lamannia is the blueprint for nature, Daanvi provides guiding order. Xoriat is a glimpse at what lies behind and beyond, of the other ways reality could have been\u2014and of the unseen ways it {@i is}.",

												"Imagine time as a maze and the Material Plane as a rat moving through it, with the other planes worn as a crown. This is how the Draconic Prophecy works. It doesn't tell you what will happen, because that hasn't been decided yet. It's a roadmap to the maze, revealing that if you take a left turn at \"Queen Aurala is assassinated\" and then turn right at \"Breland becomes a democracy,\" you'll reach \"Sul Khatesh is released from her prison.\" The Prophecy shows the path you need to take to achieve the outcome you desire\u2014a map to the many possibilities of the future.",
												"But Xoriat isn't bound to the rat. It hovers above the maze. And adventurers could return to the wrong time when they leave it, falling farther back in the maze. They could find themselves in the Empire of Dhakaan, or in the midst of the War of the Mark. And in the process, they could change the future. Perhaps they help Halas Tarkanan win the War of the Mark; the dragonmarked houses are broken and scattered before they ever achieve their current glory, and people with aberrant dragonmarks thrive. With these changes, modern Khorvaire would be a very different place. In doing this, the adventurers have dropped a new rat in the maze. This new rat becomes the Prime Material Plane. It snatches the old rat's crown of planes, becoming the reality where all the planes converge and where time moves forward. But the other rat is still out there\u2014forgotten and lost, huddled in a corner, but still alive. And it's possible that if the adventurers return to Xoriat, they could change their mind; they could find their way back to that original rat, returning it to its role as the Prime Material Plane. So Xoriat gives the possibility for dramatic change\u2014but it's always possible to restore a forgotten past.",
												"This view is critical to understanding the daelkyr. They stand above the maze, but they can also descend into it. They experiment on the rat, changing it. What happens if they make too many changes? It's possible the rat might crawl into a corner to die and a new rat be released: perhaps the old Prime is lost and a new world moves forward. This is what the gith believe happened with their world, as described in the section on Kythri. The gith lived on a world that was once the Prime Material Plane. Now it may just be another rat lost and forgotten in the maze. Should the daelkyr rise and complete their work, it's possible the current Eberron could be torn away from the planes; it would still exist, but as a forgotten shadow of the new central reality that takes its place.",
												"If this doesn't entirely make sense, that's appropriate. Most scholars in Khorvaire would call this theory madness, and so Xoriat receives its name. But others might say that this is in keeping with the myth of the Progenitors. Irian is the beginning, Mabar is the end\u2014and Xoriat could be the point that stands above the journey, the high perch from which the Progenitors could study their work. Xoriat isn't bound by the laws that bind the rest of the planes, and it holds all the ideas that were discarded. Perhaps the Sovereigns didn't entirely build reality, but rather, they {@i sculpted} it\u2014chipping things away and dropping them into Xoriat.",
												"This is a metaphysical discussion that most adventurers will never need to worry about. There are three things to take away from it. Xoriat is a point from which history and reality itself can be changed. The daelkyr have changed it an unknown number of times. And from Xoriat, it's possible for adventurers to either change it themselves\u2014or to undo damage they might have done."

Dyrrn the Corruptor, Valaara, Belashyrra\u2014each dwells in a domain in Xoriat, attended by their servants and their armies. This ties to Xoriat's uncanny relationship with time. The daelkyr may be in Xoriat because they haven't left yet, or they might've already been released from their prisons and returned to Xoriat. Again, if time is a maze, the daelkyr stand above it looking down\u2014but at the same time, they are also running in the maze. They can't return to Eberron now, because they're already there; but this may be why they seem unconcerned with their long imprisonment, because they're also watching it all unfold from above.

However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases\u2014such as the {@i storm spires} of House Lyrandar and the {@i creation forges} of House Cannith\u2014the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures.

When such an item is attuned, it can't be removed from the bearer, even if they desire it; the only way to end the attunement and remove a symbiont is to use an effect that ends a curse. This prevents the item from being taken away, but limits a character's free will, so it's up to the story you want to tell. While Symbiotic Nature is a common attribute for symbionts, it's not a requirement. A slug that functions as an {@item everbright lantern|ERLW} wouldn't require attunement. Even if the {@item periapt of wound closure} is a scarab that digs into the flesh of the bearer, perhaps it could be pried loose, or it might release its grip voluntarily if the bearer ends the attunement.",

Beyond this, its appearance reflects its theme blended with its alien nature; for example, Valaara typically appears as an angelic humanoid merged with insect elements. But after people encounter a daelkyr, those who compare notes may find they disagree on the details. The daelkyr might appear as someone the viewer knows, or its appearance could shift mid-conversation. This is not something the daelkyr controls, and it's not considered a beneficial trait; it's simply part of their alien nature.",
																"Daelkyr have telepathy with a range of 120 feet. This is their primary form of communication and is intended to be broader in scope than typical telepathy. A daelkyr can communicate with any number of creatures within range at once, projecting a thought much as other creatures project sound. Typically when a daelkyr \"speaks,\" all creatures receive the same message, but the DM might decide that one or more creatures receive a different message. And just as people see different things when they look at a daelkyr, two people can perceive a daelkyr's \"speech\" in very different ways. One may feel as though the daelkyr is speaking aloud with a strange, alien voice. Another may hear the speech of the daelkyr as the voice of a dead lover, whispering in their ear. Another may not be able to remember actually hearing the daelkyr speak; instead, they just remember its words existing, as if they've always known them.",

Quori are immortal, but they can be slain; when a quori dies, its essence returns to the Dreaming Dark, where it is reconstituted as a new spirit. Quori spirits are bound to emotions, and they feed on those emotions and excel at manipulating them in mortals. The tsucora thrive on fear, the hashalaq manipulate pleasure, the du'ulora are driven by anger, and the kalaraq consume pride and ambition. These are the most common quori, but there are many others; the spiteful tsoreva and the domineering usvapna have already been mentioned in previous editions.",

However, when a quori is reborn, there is a microscopic chance that it will be touched by il-Yannah, the incarnation of light that will one day replace the Dreaming Dark. It's possible for a quori to carry this seed of light and never embrace it. The kalaraq Taratai was the first to rally those quori who could sense the light, teaching them to push back the darkness and embrace il-Yannah. These rebels are the spirits who are now bound to the kalashtar. They are still quori\u2014tsucora, hashalaq, du'ulora, kalaraq\u2014and they are still tied to the emotion associated with their quori type. But they are driven by their vision of the light that is to come rather than the darkness of the present. Taratai's rebels fled Dal Quor long ago, and there have surely been new quori touched by il-Yannah since then. But today, the Dreaming Dark are constantly policing their own ranks and searching for such \"corrupted\" spirits. Any that are found will be destroyed, so their spirits can be reborn as proper servants of il-Lashtavar.",

All of these make them quite different from creatures such as beholders or mind flayers\u2014monsters that are deeply alien, but that are still formed of flesh and blood.",
										"The choice to classify quori as aberrations in fifth edition reflects the idea that \"aberration\" is a broad category including any entity that is fundamentally alien; and certainly, the quori have no place in the natural world. However, this has a number of concrete mechanical effects. Many effects that target evil spirits only affect fiends and undead. As aberrations, quori can't be detected by a paladin's Divine Sense or banished to Dal Quor with {@spell divine word}. The spells {@spell hallow} and {@spell forbiddance} don't protect against them. This was an intentional decision that renders quori immune to many of the tools that can be deployed against devils or demons. However, as a DM, you can choose to make quori fiends instead of aberrations if you want these spells and effects to be effective against them. Or you could compromise by leaving quori as aberrations, but say that clerics and paladins devoted to the Path of Light can affect quori with any spell or class feature that affects fiends. This keeps quori as mysterious and alien, and gives the Path of Light a unique role in battling them."

I want to build a fortress and wield a blade of steel.\" The Queen replied, \"Then leave the wood, but do not bring your metal into my domain.\" And so he left the wood and founded the kingdom of Karrnath. The next day the eldest daughter came before the Queen. \"Mother, I dream of magic! I want to build a tower and conjure fire!\" The Queen replied, \"Then leave the wood, but do not cast your spells in my domain.\" And so she left the wood and founded the kingdom of Thaliost. One by one, the Queen's children left her, until she was alone in the woods with the spirits and the beasts. And as each child raised a kingdom, the woods grew smaller and farther apart, and the heart of the Forest Queen grew bitter and cold. The people are her great-grandchildren, and she will not harm those who stay on the path and respect the beasts of the forest.

The forests containing her manifest zones could expand, with fey and feral beasts attacking villages and towns as they're overgrown.

							"The Forest Queen charges those who follow her rules to never kill with steel or wear metal armor. This can be a serious limitation for a ranger or other character that has access to martial weapons or medium or heavy armor. However, they could seek out equipment of bronzewood,an exotic lumber that only grows in Aerenal and in a few groves hidden deep in the Towering Wood. This exceptionally dense wood can be used to fashion armor without metal, which could use the same statistics as any medium or heavy armor. Arrows and crowssbow bolts can also be fashioned from {@i bronzewood}, and this exceptionally durable ammunition breaks no more often than its steel counterpart. Similarly, {@i leafweave} armor is made from alchemically treated leaves of the bronzewood tree, and can offer the same level of protection as studded leather or a chain shirt.",
							"Armor and weapons made using these substances are generally only available in Aerenal or within the Towering Woods, but if it fits a character's background, the DM could choose to allow a character's starting equipment to be made from such materials. Another option is a weapon formed from the bones of a monstrosity; here again, the principle is that the weapon is mechanically identical to a standard weapon, but doesn't violate the Forest Queen's ban on metal. If a character is using a bone weapon, there should certainly be a story to it: What creature is it from? Who killed the beast and shaped the weapon, and how did the character come by it?"

Even when he saved the kingdom from a cruel dragon, the people assumed one of his brothers had done the deed. But in that dragon's lair, the prince discovered a strange sack. Reaching inside it, he found a toy he'd loved as a child and long forgotten about, a comb lost by his sister, and a map of a nation that no longer exists. Curious, he climbed into the sack and found a castle within it, filled with forgotten wonders. No one ever noticed he was gone, and no one remembers his name or his deeds.

Doldarun asserts that they are children corrupted by Dyrrn in the womb, tools of the daelkyr waiting to be activated. The sages of Clan Narathun say that they may indeed be the result of strange forces emanating from the Realm Below, but there's no evidence that the children have any direct tie to the daelkyr or that they're drawn to malefic actions. Regardless of the truth, ruinbound dwarves are a recent development. The first ruinbound children were born thirty years ago, and traditionally, dwarves aren't even considered to be adults until their fiftieth year; however, ruinbound children mature surprisingly (some say unnaturally) quickly.",
					"Ruinbound dwarves are quite rare and can be born to dwarves of any bloodline. The Mror still don't know what to make of them, though their attitude toward symbionts generally mirrors that toward ruinbound dwarves. The Doldarun dwarves are hostile to any ruinbounds that come to their land, and claim that ruinbound children are never born in their clan; while that's a possibility, there are also rumors of Soldorak agents among the Doldarun that spirit away these infants to a clan that celebrates them, lest they meet a darker fate. The Droranath and Toldorath clans are curious, but they won't necessarily ostracize ruinbound dwarves. Soldorak and Narathun families might embrace a ruinbound child\u2014but they also might reject them out of fear that other clans could use them to paint the entire family as corrupted. In creating a ruinbound character, you need to decide how you were received, reflected by your background. Are you an urchin or an outlander, having made your own way after being rejected by your family? Are you a charlatan or a criminal, forced down a dangerous path by the fears of those around you? Or might you be a noble, treasured by your family despite\u2014or because of\u2014your condition?",
					"As a ruinbound dwarf, you could also choose to attribute your class abilities to your symbiont or your unnatural nature. As a sorcerer, your spellcasting could be channeled through your symbiont or other mutations. Any class with Unarmored Defense could present it as being tied to a physical mutation; if you're a barbarian, your rage could manifest as an active transformation. If you're a ruinbound warlock, you could say that your symbiont is your patron, an active sentience within you\u2014and if you help it grow, it promises you greater powers.",
					"While others might fear them, ruinbound dwarves aren't innately evil. In creating a ruinbound character, talk with your DM about where you'd like your story to go. Do you want to be faced with the threat of corruption? Is it possible that Dyrrn does have plans for you? Or do you want to be a true hero despite your seemingly sinister features?"

Unarmored Defense reflects defensive shapeshifting, and when you develop Ki-Empowered Strikes it reflects an enhancement of your natural weapons.",

However, any member of any species can follow these paths. If you don't possess any innate shapeshifting gifts or a bond to a quori spirit, it's up to you and your DM to explain how you manifest these gifts.

This allows you to convey a short message\u2014a concept that can be expressed in six words or less\u2014to anyone who knows the language and who can see you. Typically the message is something you maintain as part of your appearance; for example, in crafting your image, you might add a pattern of scars that tells other changeling travelers, 'I need help' or 'Everything I say is a lie.'",

The shifting patterns can be noticed by other observers within 60 feet; if you wish to keep the conversation discrete, you can hide it with a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check opposed by the observer's Wisdom ({@skill Perception} or {@skill Insight}) check. If you fail, it means the observer notices your shifting patterns, though they don't understand the meaning unless they also know skin cant."
