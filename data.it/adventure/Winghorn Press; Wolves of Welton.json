Merriksonn will mention that the village's usual protector - his brother, a Sorcerer named {@b Alexi} - went missing at around the same time the attacks began, forcing them to turn to professional adventurers for aid.",

A councillor with a tuft of wool tied to his vest will introduce himself as Corel of the Fleecers' Guild and say that he has been working on the hills for thes best part of forty years and is happy to answer questions on the local environment and provide general support for the party."

He will shy away from the party at first, but will tell them everything he knows if they promise to believe him.",

Their memories of the fight are hazy, but there was a flash of bright light. When they awoke the Lightbringer - as they call him - was gone, but the wolves found their minds working much faster than before. Almost instantly they found they were able to talk, and their memories were filled with strange images and information that appeared to them in dreams.",
										"The pack has been using its newfound abilities to boost its quality of life. Pups won't risk starvation in the winter thanks to their hoarded herd of sheep, while their elderly won't have to be left behind when no longer able to hunt. They drove off the Owlbear that had been plaguing the woods for years and made their home in its den.",

										"Bolt does not care for the people of Welton, who have killed his kind indiscriminately for many years. However, he is willing to at least try and come to a settlement with them, suggesting that they be allowed control of the woods and the uninhabited lands to the west, in return for keeping the area free of other predators and not raiding themselves.",
										"Barring that, he is willing to simply move the pack away to a more remote location, provided that the party swear by all their gods not to tell people what they saw.",
										"Should it become apparent that a deal is forthcoming, Flame will accuse Bolt of cowardice and betrayal and attack him from behind. This will badly injure him, taking him out of the fight. All of the remaining armored wolves will join her in a final, desperate attack on the party, while the others will fall back in confusion and fear."
