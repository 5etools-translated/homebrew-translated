Adventurers slew the dragon in a cataclysmic battle, which caused Sagur to erupt, killing them and everything else for miles.",

								"In the aftermath of the cataclysm, the plains to the west of Mount Magra and the Sagur caldera became incredibly fertile. Over time, plants grew again in the ground and people settled there, founding villages and cultivating farmland. The closest village is Dorma, about 5 miles away, situated on a burbling stream fed by mountain springs.",
								"Over the course of the last week, several farmers in the area heard strange sounds coming from the caldera\u2014and others reported sightings of monsters, though none of the creatures attacked or approached any of the farms.",

She inspected the caldera and its surroundings, finding no sign of volcanic activity in the caldera or Mount Magra, nor did she find any creatures, though she did find some scorched trees. Unsatisfied but out of leads, Ferriahn returned to the village to research and await further developments. After hearing more of the same from the farmers, she returned to investigate again only to discover that the caldera was bubbling with magma and Mount Magra was leaking toxic volcanic gas. Using her magic and knowledge gained by her lifelong study of volcanoes, Ferriahn sensed a planar rift in the magma of the caldera and that it was somehow causing its twin volcano to become unstable. Troubled, she returned to Dorma after narrowly escaping an encounter with a {@creature fire elemental}.",
								"After some research and prayer, Ferriahn determined that the rift was unstable, and that it's likely that if a certain amount of explosive energy\u2014fire, lightning, thunder, or force\u2014is used in the caldera, it may cause Mount Magra to erupt. Using the {@spell scrying} spell, she observed fiends, dragons, and elementals emerging from the rift, any of which could employ such explosive energies. She believes the planar rift will remain open as long as any of the creatures that came through it survive or remain on this plane\u2014and that closing the rift will render the volcano and caldera dormant once again. If that is not done, she fears the volcano will erupt, causing incredible devastation."
