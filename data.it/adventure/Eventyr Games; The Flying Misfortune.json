When he uses his Change Shape ability, he prefers to assume the form of a ruddy-skinned halfling with curly, bronze-colored hair or a young human lad with blond hair and sunbronzed skin. Felgolos is no friend of the Black Network. Any party member affiliated with the Zhentarim can, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check, recall tales of a dragon that matches Felgolos' description attacking Zhentarim caravans and snatching their wagons, beasts of burden and all. In fact, Felgolos has a large collection of Zhentarim wagons and isn't afraid to admit it. He won't part with any of them, however, because he considers the wagons and their cargo as his treasure. He targets Zhentarim caravans specifically because he knows the Black Network's sinister reputation and delights in frustrating the Zhents' plans.",

Also, remember that it's perfectly fine to play the dragons less than optimally: maybe one dragon is more concerned with returning to secure its own hoard, and the other dragon is too blinded by rage to use all its legendary actions or cares more about grabbing stolen loot than killing adventurers."
