					"Deep beneath the earth, the derro wait in twisted cities built by their mad architects. These insane humanoids live, work, and somehow thrive in the lightless depths. They understand the truth about the uncaring gods that dwell between the stars, and they abandoned sanity long ago to save themselves. The derro hide within their insanity in the hope that the dark gods they fear will turn their attention to other, saner races first.",
					"Despite the great distances between their Underdark cities and the surface, derro outposts can be found in the underworld and slums of many cities, both above and below ground. Occasionally, a derro discovers the wider world and finds a path out of the madness.",
					"{@b Pale and Stunted}",
					"The derro are stunted, dwarflike humanoids, small of stature with wide shoulders and stubby limbs. They stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, with males only slighter taller than females on average. Their slender builds rarely weigh more than 40 pounds. Their pale skin is nearly translucent, revealing a ghostly web of blue veins. Their large, pure white staring eyes gleam in the dark.",
					"Shorter than surface dwarves, derro are quick and erratic in their movements. Their elaborately braided or styled hair ranges from white to a pale straw color. Males take great pride in their prodigious mustaches, which are often braided and waxed.",
					"{@b History of Madness}",
					"The true history of the derro is an incomprehensible tangle. The entire race is insane, so even when derro keep records, their accounts conflict with each other and with observable reality. The various cults and clans of the derro embrace a wide variety of myths, mostly passed along by oral tradition and mind-bending artwork. Every new teller of a given tale twists or rewrites portions of the story to fit their own warped view of the world.",
					"The derro have existed for ages, perhaps thriving even before the spread of humans across the surface. The more reliable histories of other races agree that the derro have always served the drow as enforcers and slave masters. The drow regard them with a strange type of favor, almost like dim-witted children. The aboleths and duergar have likewise historically used and abused the derro. The derro know no actual friends, but they are overawed by power and dominance. They serve beings whose assumed superiority impresses them.",
					"{@b Culture and Rule}",
					"Love as other races know it is unheard of in the bizarre core family unit of the derro. Derro children are born sane, but they are deliberately driven mad by their relatives, usually by age four. Parents feed, clothe, and protect their children not out of a sense of love or tenderness, but because they know that every derro awakened to the mind-bending truth of their race brings them glory. The horrific rituals that break a young derro's sanity vary by tribe and even year to year. Details are sparse, but known ritual names include Staring into the Void, Enduring the Heartless Fire, and the First Drink of True Knowledge.",
					"Derro are paranoid, unstable, and jittery, and many suffer powerful delusions of grandeur as well. Madness compels them to commit acts of cruelty against their companions or pets, and these acts ignite constant infighting among them. A few, however, muster enough restraint and control to keep the entirety of derro society from crumbling. Savants are powerful sorcerers who hold their madness at bay long enough to cobble together coherent plans, though even they are dangerously unpredictable. The most powerful leaders are the derro antipaladins. These terrifying engines of crazed destruction have looked deep into the void between stars and survived, and even the savants respect them for that.",
					"{@b Gods of the Derro}",
					"The derro worship a horde of bizarre and terrible beings. Derro ancestral gods such as Addrikah, the Mother of Madness, are common figures of veneration, as are demon lords. Perhaps the most disturbing of their deities are the Great Old Ones whose mere symbolic presence melts minds and corrupts the world. Derro worshipers venerate Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath the Black Goat of the Woods in particular. There is no pattern or reason that governs which dark being will catch a given derro's fancy, and devotees are violently hostile to worshipers of other entities.",
					"Derro consider themselves the most exalted servants of the blasphemous figures they venerate, the only beings in the entire multiverse who can truly understand their glory. Specific rituals vary from cult to cult, but the unifying thread of derro faith asserts that their racial madness is a gift that makes communion with these deities possible. Further, the derro believe they are the harbingers of the end of time, and that they alone will inherit the shattered husk of creation.",
					"{@b Derro Names}",
					"Names are thrust upon derro children haphazardly and with no clear general customs. Derro who worship an ancestor god might give their children a variation on the exalted figure's name or title, or a child might grow almost to maturity before any adult bothers to call them by the same jumble of sounds twice. Clan, tribe, and family names also lack any discernable pattern, though occasionally they form a coherent description.",

					"Derro are unpredictable, fanciful, and prone to delusions, confusions, and manias. So how can they function in groups more used to the stability of humans, dwarves, and elves?",
					"In truth, the derro are less violent and more peculiar in a quieter way than their common portrayal as rabid maniacs. Among themselves, they are as likely to be brooding, depressed, or sullen as crazed and violent. A derro PC could have a tendency to talk to himself, or might address an invisible friend before undertaking any major step, or might simply consider all the other members of the party as \"imaginary friends,\" and thus not subject to harassment.",
					"Treat the derro's madness as an occasional bit of flavor for the character, rather than an excuse to cripple the party with chaotic and self-defeating actions. A derro PC won't be as predictable as a dwarf paladin or a half-elf bard, but if the other players can cope with a bonestupid half-orc barbarian picking bar fights and that elf rogue picking the ogre's pockets, they might accept the derro occasionally talking to rocks and interrogating mushrooms. Review the Minor Madnesses section for examples of playable and flavorful maladies.",
					"To avoid derailing the party constantly, the character can have long lucid periods, and might even regret actions taken when \"turned to the dark void\" or \"ridden by the bat spirits\" or a similar in-game explanation. The derro in this lucid state could be a tragic character, always wondering when something will set off another bout of irrational raving.",

					"Their flawless features are tinged with some unnamable exotic quality. Despite the fear and uncertainty that follow them, the half-dead possess a seductive appearance. Listeners find themselves unconsciously giving weight to a dhampir's words and are drawn to his or her presence. Dhampirs glide through life with a seemingly effortless grace that belies their struggle.",
					"{@b Blood Ties}",
					"For most dhampirs, family is all they have. Immediate kin might be the only source of solace for a dhampir raised by a mortal family. Driven away by the unconscious or superstitious derision of their peers, families containing a dhampir can easily become clannish and reclusive. They learn to keep the world at a distance to protect themselves and their loved ones. Dhampirs who grow up in this situation commonly strike out on their own after reaching maturity, both out of a need to find connection to the greater world and to spare their family the burden of their presence.",
					"Conversely, some dhampirs are born into bloodlines that deliberately cultivate their tainted nature. A true vampire patron, usually the one who originally began the line, oversees these bloodlines. Such a bloodline holds its lineage in the highest regard. There is no doubt among its members that theirs is a superior stock and upbringing, and that greatness is their due. The majority of outright evil dhampirs arise from cultivated bloodlines. They quickly become true monsters, seeing the fear of the living world as envy of their station.",
					"{@b Cultural Masks}",
					"Particularly close-knit or cosmopolitan communities can easily tolerate a dhampir in their midst, but that has more to do with adherence to tradition or relative anonymity than true acceptance. Larger cities include dhampirs sprinkled among the population as the half-dead blend in and find their niche, relying on their innate charm. Dhampir don't relate easily to humans but find a natural kinship with other half-breed races, particularly the fiendish tieflings. They, along with half-orcs and half-elves, know all too well what it's like to live between two worlds, never truly fitting in to either.",
					"Some dhampirs choose to band together for safety, camaraderie, and understanding. These groups are nomadic, traveling from town to town and making their living off the land. Such a band adheres to a loose set of guidelines called the Walking Crow edicts. These rules dictate the dhampirs' responsibility to protect one another from outsiders, for each caravan group to self-govern and be self-sustaining, and for every Crow to work toward the prosperity of the caravan. These groups rarely find warm welcome with outsiders, but they are tolerated because the Crows develop diverse adventuring skills by necessity. Despite their trepidation, villagers can resolve threats to their homes by hiring a band of Crows to handle the problem for them.",
					"{@b Candles in the Dark",
					"Dhampirs constantly struggle with their nature. They suffer from a troubled upbringing and intrinsic corruption that gnaws at civilized thoughts and behavior. The truth of their heritage weighs on them. Many experience disturbing urges to consume blood or to control others. They shun the light and find safety and comfort in darkness. Enticed and repulsed by mortals at the same time, this constant struggle is at the core of a dhampir's existence.",
					"Many dhampirs use this struggle as fuel to action. Good dhampirs are horrified by their own corrupted existence and dedicate themselves to living in opposition to it. They become priests who venerate gods of light, or they vow to destroy all undead who perpetuate their misery. Others are broken by their turmoil. They lash out at the world in a rage of bloodlust and hatred. Many evil dhampirs turn to worship of demons and other gods of darkness and pain, seeking to conquer and subjugate their mortal peers.",
					"{@b Dhampir Names",
					"Most dhampirs bear names appropriate to their mothers' human culture. Some, particularly those belonging to cultivated bloodlines, might have archaic names chosen by, or in honor of, their family's vampire patron. Surnames follow a similar pattern. Dhampirs might use the family name of their mortal relatives, or they might adopt the family name of a powerful vampire as a badge of office. Nomadic dhampirs uniformly take the surname \"Crow.\""

Dust goblins thrive in the everlasting gloom of their desolate homeland, living among the rotting remains of destroyed cities, in roaming caravan villages, or in networks of tunnels.",

Their lips and gums have shriveled away, revealing yellowed, interlocking grins made of teeth ritually filed to points. Their skin ranges in tone from dusky gray to dark green and is marred by cracks, lesions, or tumorous growths. Their eyes gleam blood-red or bright gold when they catch a stray mote of light and glow in the darkness.",

The vast majority of their kind congregates in the eastern reaches of the wastes, in such great numbers that the area is known as the Goblin Wastes. The various tribes are extremely insular and keep their secrets from outsiders\u2014including the names of their tribes. Explorers from beyond the wastes label the tribes with various names for their convenience. Though the goblins find these pseudonyms insulting, they grudgingly use them with outsiders. They believe that revealing the true name of the tribe would give away its power. Outsiders are sometimes surprised to discover that dust goblins carry themselves with a proud, severe bearing, as opposed to their more common cousins.",
					"Despite their distrustful tendencies, dust goblin tribes aren't completely unapproachable. Their survival skills are exceptional, as the most successful of the few sentient races that thrive in the wastelands. Outsiders who approach a dust goblin tribe with respect\u2014and perhaps useful offerings\u2014can secure their services as guides to lost ruins or for safe passage through the badlands. Some dust goblins even leave the \"safety\" of their homeland and join adventuring bands. In these cases, some extraordinary circumstance forged a trust between the dust goblin and the outsiders. As long as that trust isn't abused, the dust goblin's loyalty is assured.",

These wretches find kinship with the misshapen aberrations that arise in the wastes. They form disturbing symbiotic relationships with the corrupt creatures and even live alongside them. As living idols of the dark gods the mad goblins worship, even perceived threats to these abominations can whip an entire tribe in to a murder frenzy.",

These goblins venerate the unknowable deities from between the stars, beings of insanity and darkness that worm their way into the minds of mortals who stray where they shouldn't.

					"Native people from the deepest deserts, the jinnborn claim they were the first mortals to walk the world. They say that in the beginning, all the world was a vast desert beneath a fiery sun; in those times, the jinnborn wandered where they willed, and ruled over all they saw. They refer to themselves as the sab siraat, or \"people of the path.\" Descended from powerful elemental creatures call jinn (singular jinni), the jinnborn manifest gifts through their lineage that help them survive their harsh home environment.",
					"Passionate people, the jinnborn seek wealth when they can, revel in revenge when they must, and cherish close companionship always. Outsiders label them as capricious or even savage, never fully aware of the veil that hides the jinnborn's true nature.",
					"{@b Touch of the Jinn}",
					"Jinnborn are somewhat shorter than humans, rarely growing taller than 6 feet. Their shorter stature leaves them stocky of build, and their frames are muscular and hardy\u2014adults can easily weigh in excess of 170 pounds. Jinnborn skin tone comes in a wide range of colors from sky blue to light violet and from golden to brick red.",
					"Secondary features such as nub horns, pointed teeth, or elemental gleams flickering deep within their eyes all mark the otherworldly heritage of the jinnborn. Nearly all jinnborn sport pointed ears, and they are fond of decorating themselves with precious metal and stone jewelry. They prefer brightly colored, loose and flowing clothing, appropriate to the burning desert days and brisk nights.",
					"{@b Paths to Plenty}",
					"The core philosophy that drives all jinnborn regardless of their station is siraati\u2014a mystical path that jinnborn believe is their spiritual and cultural guide. Intrinsic to being sab siraat is the belief that the jinni who created the tribes set them on a path that would lead ultimately to the Hidden World, a place beyond the toil of normal existence. The Hidden World is a land of plenty and fulfilled desire, free of the harsh realities of the desert and unspoiled by the plots and greed of the pathless. Sab siraat are divided along elemental lines, like the jinn themselves, and tribes tend to adhere to a single elemental path.",
					"Although every jinnborn tribe holds these paths sacred, no two agree on the specifics. Some common elements persist between siraati of different tribes, however, based on the elemental nature of the paths themselves. Air sab siraat are proud and aloof. Fire-based sab siraat are vicious and draconian. Water sab siraat are carefree but mercurial, and earth sab siraat are stoic and driven. Even with these tendencies, tribes exhibit great diversity in customs, laws, stories, and mannerisms. Some tribes boast multiple patron jinn and might therefore represent multiple forms of the siraati. Other tribes absorb members through conquest or marriage, and likewise have access to more than one elemental path. Once a jinnborn sets his or her mind upon a siraati, however, only the patron jinni's intervention can change it.",
					"{@b Life on the Path}",
					"Tribes of jinnborn take the concept of mystical paths very seriously, and they follow a nomadic lifestyle in accordance with those paths. Whether a given tribe herds camels or other livestock and follows the supply of fresh water from oasis to river, or another tribe rides as a family caravan seeking wealth through trade, literal and philosophical paths govern all. The tribes follow the physical paths their elders set down, knowing that these safe routes will lead them around dangerous sands, past beguiling mirages, and to safety and sustenance. Other jinnborn tribes make their way as mercenaries, selling their spells and blades as guards, soldiers-for-hire, or even turning to banditry. This is their path to the Hidden World.",
					"Few jinnborn turn their back on the paths that lead them through the desert, and with good reasons. Outsiders frequently misread the jinnborn, though that is not entirely their fault. The jinnborn keep their word meticulously between themselves, but when dealing with the pathless outsiders, the line between what is said and what is meant blurs like the desert horizon at noon. The jinnborn rarely lie outright, but they speak in terms that allow them to twist their meaning.",
					"Also, the jinnborn who leave the open sands of the desert lose part of themselves. The longer they dwell in cities, they more they take on strange quirks and mannerisms. Remain away from the desert long enough, and their oddities develop into full-blown madness.",
					"{@b Patron Jinn}",
					"Jinn share many traits with genies\u2014the most well known of the powerful elementals\u2014but they are vastly more powerful still. Immortal beings older than recorded history, the jinn could easily contend with the sultans and emirs of the genie courts. The patrons of the oldest jinnborn tribes even approach demigod status. Although the material plane tribes might worship the jinn, they are not gods or even godlings, and they grant no spells or true divine powers through belief alone. Jinnborn rarely worship any gods, for to do so marks a jinnborn as having strayed from the path.",
					"Jinn are tied to one of the four elements, and they dwell on the corresponding elemental plane. They eschew the material plane except in rare occasions, either to duel a rival on neutral ground or to visit their patron tribes. So ancient are the jinn that most no longer use their names. They do have formal names, and these names have been kept safe by the patron's tribes. Jinnborn keep the name of the patron a close secret, and it is a deadly insult for a jinnborn to speak the name of another tribe's patron.",

Much like their physical appearance, their air of calm contemplation is likewise a veneer that conceals the truth\u2014the kijani harbor a deep furnace of fury. Nearly destroyed by a tragedy long ago, the entire race carries the embers of that brush with oblivion and must constantly struggle against letting that rage consume them.",

As plant creatures, their bodies are compact and heavier than their silhouette would suggest. Males easily weigh over 190 pounds and females around 160. Skin and hair immediately give away the truth of a kijani's nature, as both are rich green in color.",
					"They are beautiful creatures, with stunning features and smooth skin. Their eyes are large and dominated by solid green pupils. Kijani move with easy grace, like saplings swaying in a warm breeze. Though they are capable of great bursts of speed and agility when needed, the plantfolk normally move sinuously. Their motions are generally deliberate and seductive, as if slowly dancing their way through life.",
					"{@b History and Change}",
					"For eons the kijani plantfolk dwelled peacefully in the dense jungle, barely noted by the powerful beings whose empire covered the world in ancient times. Upheaval came with the arrival of a circle of human druids. The kijani embraced the newcomers and welcomed them, sharing their deep, intimate knowledge of the natural world and the magic that flows through nature's veins. Their kindness spelled disaster. Using kijani knowledge, the foolish druids summoned a mighty avatar of nature that ravaged and dominated the mighty jungles, using them like its personal playthings. The kijani fled the beast's mutating and controlling power, but fully half the race was lost. Those left behind or captured were twisted into the thing's mindless servants, and the rest sought sanctuary in jungles far to the south.",
					"This exodus left the kijani deeply scarred. They maintain their peaceful kinship with other living things to this day, but the breaking of their race ignited the cinders of the boiling fury that plagues them. Tormented by equal parts fear and rage toward the great beast, the kijani strive to mend themselves by changing their nature. They call this plan the Great Change: They intend to leave their plant nature behind completely and become mammals.",
					"{@b Life and Growth}",
					"The kijani start life in a very different state from most humanoids. When the plantfolk create a child, a single parent produces a seedling\u2014a vinelike plant that symbiotically bonds with a host. Traditionally the parent hosts the seedling, which draws nutrients and even a small amount of life force directly from its host. The process is essentially harmless, resulting in little more than occasional fatigue and increased appetite for the host. The seedling gestates in this way, growing slightly larger over the course of a decade or so, until one day it detaches and begins its transformation into the adult stage. This process is rapid, and a fully adult kijani emerges 24 hours later.",
					"Now, the kijani seek out a new way to perpetuate their species. While many plantfolk parents still serve as hosts to their seedling children, some seek out willing mammalian humanoid surrogates to host their seedlings for them. This is a crucial part of their Great Change\u2014drawing energy, nutrition, and life from humanoids to incorporate into their children. As a society the kijani never force or trick others to serve as seedling hosts, but they welcome any willing surrogates into their culture with open arms and boundless gratitude.",
					"{@b Culture and Relations}",
					"To keep their roiling base urges in check, the kijani strive to be as serene and controlled as possible. Kijani band together in organizations known as clusters\u2014groups of individual plantfolk who work together for the common good. Each cluster is guided by a single kijani known as a speaker. Though individual kijani are warm, personable, welcoming, and even seductive, clusters project a different attitude. They can be close-minded and clannish, with a tendency to prioritize their collective interests above individual concerns.",
					"Despite their generally amiable nature, all kijani have a breaking point. The contained fury within them will eventually have its due, and when pushed past endurance, the kijani lash out with terrible ferocity. Mammalian humanoids completely fascinate the plantfolk. They work hard to understand human and other races' customs when they make contact with outsiders, and they commonly adopt those customs into their culture. Despite their group tendency to band together, kijani have a great reverence for life and can always find a way to relate with other living beings. One universal exception exists\u2014druids. Plantfolk have a difficult time trusting druids given their race's history and fear of repeating the past disaster. Given their respect for life, they also abhor the undead and stop at nothing to exterminate them.",

					"Sensuous and seductive, the serpent-tailed lamias are born into a life consumed by bitterness. The race's origins lie with humanity, but an ancient curse twisted them into half-human, half-animal forms. No matter what victories lamias achieve, they can't fill the gaping hole in their souls the curse left behind. This unquenchable longing drives lamias to embrace excess and overindulgence. They indulge in lust, luxury, gory feasts, and violent trysts in a vain attempt to salve their emptiness.",
					"Some lamias, however, see this hedonism for the corruption it truly is and reject it. They face a constant struggle against these urges, and that resistance fervently drives them to do what they know is right, rather than what will numb their pain.",
					"{@b Seductive and Serpentine}",
					"A lamia's upper body is that of a beautiful, statuesque human. Slender and well formed, lamias are uniformly alluring despite a dangerous, exotic edge flavoring that beauty. From the waist down, however, lamias bear great serpent tails. When drawn up to their full height they stand about as tall as humans, reaching 5 or 6 feet tall. The musculature of their tails makes them heavy despite their lean, muscular torsos and arms.",
					"Skin and hair tones run the wide range seen among humans. Lamia eyes are large and liquid, presenting a full range of colors. Their snake tails are covered in glossy scales that whisper when they move. Beautiful hypnotic patterns of curves or diamond shapes are just as likely as tails of a uniform color. Common colors include bright green, dull red, glossy black, pale gold, and dusty tan. Tattoos are common, and many lamias ink mystic symbols into the flesh of their arms and chests.",
					"{@b Demonic Origin}",
					"The curse that brought the lamias into existence originated in the Abyss. The stain of that corrupt demonic power left its mark on the lamias, and they are prone to both evil and chaos. Even those who reject their nature and strive for the light struggle with their heritage, and all are prone to sudden mood shifts and outbursts. As a result of this otherworldly touch, their flesh remains unblighted by age. Once lamias reach maturity they show little physical sign of aging, even as they near the end of their lifespans. They aren't immortal, but lamias remain beautiful until the grave swallows them.",
					"Reflecting this frozen beauty, the race suffers from a stunted capacity to create. True artists are almost unheard of, and those lamias who make the attempt often resort to stealing inspiration from others only to produce works that showcase the race's psychological scars. Anything created by a lamia shows a bent toward the grotesque, evoking cruelty or pain. To cover their creative lack, lamias become avid collectors of all kinds of art and patrons of artists. Good-aligned lamias strive to surround themselves with things they find truly beautiful, but even they fall prey to reflecting darker appetites in their collections. Lamias who embrace their dark nature create collections that glorify lust, violence, and power.",
					"{@b Life Among the Lamias}",
					"Lamia culture is cutthroat at the best of times. Dominated by the powerful matriarchs, lamia society is characterized by self-interest, pleasure-seeking, and deadly oneupmanship. Concepts like remorse and compassion are alien to most lamias, forcing any who recognize the twisted nature of their existence to hide their qualms or flee. Concepts like monogamy and familial affection are likewise all but unknown. Although both male and female lamias exist, females outnumber males by three to one.",
					"As a result of their gender ratios combined with their highly matriarchal nature, trysts between female lamias are as common as between male and female. Assignations between lamias occur for power and pleasure, never for love\u2014a concept revolting to most of the race. Even pairings that produce offspring have no special significance to the parents. Young lamias are left to fend for themselves almost immediately after birth, since their culture emphasizes that survival engenders strength.",
					"{@b Relations and Religion}",
					"Lamias have abysmal relationships with other races, who rightly view them with fear and revulsion despite their intense beauty. The lamias see other creatures as little more than playthings yet to be broken. They might form temporary alliances to pursue a common agenda or even take a lover of another race they find attractive or interesting, but such dalliances never last. The so-called \"false lamias,\" those with lower bodies of great cats, drive lamias into a murderous frenzy. Serpentine lamias will go to any lengths to destroy these pretenders.",
					"Lamia society has little use for religion or gods, and clerics and other representatives of the divine are unheard of among them. Magic and mysticism, however, is deeply ingrained in lamia culture. Practitioners of arcane magic are as common as divine spellcasters are rare. Lamias show reverence to only one thing\u2014the moon. Many of their rites center around the moon and take place under its light. Those lamias who reject their corrupt upbringing reject the racial hatred of the divine and seek comfort in devotion to deities, particularly those associated with the moon.",
					"{@b Lamia Names}",
					"Unlike most other creatures, lamias don't differentiate between male and female names. The lack of a racial language means many of their names are combinations of words culled from Draconic and Abyssal, meant to complement their sibilant accent.",

					"The enigmatic ramag thrive in the heart of a land once ruled by an empire of titans. In that bygone age, the ramag served the titans. The race's natural affinity for manipulating magic made the ramag essential to tending a vast web of magical energy. This web channeled power to the farthest corners of the empire and powered the titans' wonders. When the titans fell to madness, everything fell apart. As these powerful creatures turned on one another and tore their empire down stone by stone, the web fractured. Wonders failed or went haywire. Magical gates once used to link far-flung outposts went dark or conjured horrors. Uncontrolled magical energy spilled across the land, wreaking unpredictable havoc.",
					"Now, the ramag live in the ruins of that glory. Changed by the energies of the shattered web, they devote themselves to policing the remaining titan wonders and keeping the rampant energies in check.",
					"{@b Warped by Magic}",
					"Ramag superficially resemble humans, but long exposure to unpredictable magical currents has warped their physical forms. Males stand close to 6 feet tall with females only slightly shorter, but their body proportions are unique. Ramag limbs are very long and lanky, while their torsos are smaller and more compact. As a result they seem strangely angular and spindly, as if both stretched and compressed at the same time.",
					"Their hair is another oddity\u2014every strand of hair is unusually thick, each about the width of a finger. Ramag tie their hair back with distinctive clasps, the decorations indicating where a given ramag comes from. Facial features are somewhat pinched and angular. Ramag eyes and skin tone tend toward darker shades, as does their hair color, but large variation exists. A stoic people, ramag dress in muted colors in public and save flamboyant or daring outfits for family, friends, or private gatherings.",
					"{@b Scattered Remnants}",
					"The ramag race lives in the remains of a sprawling city that was their capital in the glorious age past. Called Ramagani, or \"home\" in the ramag dialect, the city exists as nearly a dozen separate districts scattered across their continent. Collectively these districts are all considered a single metropolis. Transit between the far-flung districts is feasible by means of the monoliths\u2014massive stone constructs that once guided and stabilized the flows of magical power in the ancient empire. The monoliths still maintain flows of magical energy to this day, and they serve as portals for travel between districts.",
					"Once there were more districts of Ramagani, but tragedies since the fall of the empire have taken their toll on the city. The most prominent of these disasters was a magical plague called the arcane wasting that ripped through a land near one of Ramagani's districts. The naturally magical ramag were highly susceptible to the disease, and it ravaged the inhabitants of the local district so swiftly that the only hope for the rest of the city was to cut off the transit gates leading there. Collapsing the monoliths that powered the portals to the district might well have saved the race, but it doomed many of their people. Each remaining district holds a yearly memorial festival in the honor of those lost souls.",
					"{@b Cultural Cornerstones}",
					"Ramag culture revolves around the guardianship and maintenance of the magical monoliths that connect their precious city. The creation of a new monolith is a monumental two-step process. After the physical monolithis constructed, the first step is an incantation that all ramag learn as a rite of passage. It binds their souls to the new monolith, even after death. The second step occurs after a ramag's death, when his or her remains are interred within the appropriate monolith. Many years pass between these steps, so successfully empowering a new monolith is a cause for great celebration.",
					"New monoliths provide additional stability for the magical flows of energy that crisscross the land, or replace a damaged or failing monolith that supports one of the many gates of Ramagani. All told, the monolith network powers two or three gateway arches in each district of the city, and the portals all link to Ramagani's primary site. Should the wrong monoliths fail, entire districts of the city could be cut off from the rest of their race for unknown stretches of time.",
					"{@b Control and Defense}",
					"Ramag rarely become adventurers, but they maintain several groups that cultivate similar skills. These groups come into contact with adventurers both within Ramagani and in the surrounding lands. The Wardens are specialists who travel the land following the flows of magic. The Wardens maintain the monoliths away from the city and are responsible for taming threads of the ancient magical web that become unstable. Many Wardens are wizards who dedicate their lives to the study of the web. Another group called the Scaled Keepers, comprised primarily of rangers, incubates pterodactyl eggs and rears the young. They train the creatures to serve as flying mounts for messengers and scouts.",
					"The other specialized ramag orders remain mostly within the city. First among them is the Stormwatch\u2014a garrison that watches the walls of each Ramagani node. Its members operate magical lightning ballistae that help secure the city. Powered by the monoliths and fed by the magical flows, these siege engines give the city's districts a deadly edge. Stormwatch members join the garrison for life, and each is considered vital from the lowest ranks to the highest echelons of command. The other major group centered within Ramagani is the Gatekeepers, overseers who keep watch over the Wall of Gates. The Wall bears a range of ancient portals that occasionally spark to life, reopening lost paths and exposing the city to both lost artifacts and knowledge and sudden peril. The Gatekeepers drive back threats that emerge from the gates and occasionally oversee expeditions through stable portals.",

The ramag monoliths stabilize the ley lines and keep them from drifting and twisting, but many remain uncontrolled.

The cruel and ravenous sahuagin\u2014also known as sea devils\u2014thrive where other aquatic races founder. A wickedly perfect fusion of humanoid and shark, sahuagin glide through the ocean in search of prey and conquest.",
					"Great cities darken the ocean floors where the sea devils dwell, and coastal fortresses in shallower waters and reefs expand their influence to the boundary between sea and land. Bloodthirsty yet methodical, the sahuagin brutally defend their territory beneath the waves, primarily against the aquatic elves, their ancient foes. Sharks are drawn to the sea devils and easily fall beneath their sway, creating a tide of fins and fangs and blood to sweep over the world's oceans.",
					"{@b Tooth and Fin}",
					"About 7 feet tall and weighing over 250 pounds, sahuagin are built to hunt. Solidly muscular, the sea devils are humanoid in basic shape with horns and membranes that form frills down the spine and along a powerful, lashing tail. Similar structures form distinctive ear frills on the sides of their heads, and their hand and feet are webbed. Fingers end in hard claws, and a sahuagin's wide mouth is filled with multiple rows of sharklike teeth.",
					"Their skin is incredibly thick, rivaling leather armor in terms of protection. Sahuagin skin tones range from dark green to dusty blue along the back of the body, fading to lighter shades on the creature's underbelly. Frills and fins can be yellow, red, orange, or pink, in contrast to the base skin color. Sometimes mutations occur, and the more powerful and feared sahuagin warlords sport four arms or sharklike tails instead of legs. Primarily aquatic, sahuagin can survive for several hours at a time on dry land, though they are extremely uncomfortable out of water.",
					"{@b Circling Beneath the Waves}",
					"Although they can survive in fresh water, sahuagin prefer warm bodies of salt water at depths of at least 100 feet. Temperature and pressure are no obstacle to them, and they build great settlements of stone and coral on the lightless ocean floor. Sahuagin cities are honeycombed with spherical chambers and cylindrical tunnels. Most structures in a sahuagin settlement sport doors and corridors wide enough to accommodate swimming sharks. If the city is close enough to the surface to catch light, sahuagin cultivate beds of seaweed to provide padding and comfort in their otherwise unfurnished living chambers.",
					"Despite their monstrous appearance and bloodthirsty nature, sahuagin are highly civilized, and they prize intellect, order, and structure. The most powerful sahuagin in a city or settlement rules under the title of \"Lord of Blood and Battle,\" and the remainder of the society breaks into two main castes: nobles and commoners. Despite the social strata a given sahaugin is born into, all sea devils receive a mandatory education. Most of this training revolves around battle and tactics, but the sahuagin keep a meticulous oral history. Sahuagin life is cruel and brutal within this rigid structure, filled with the constant struggle of the weak brutalized by the strong.",
					"{@b Deep Devotion}",
					"The clergy represents a notable exception to the caste system that dominates sahuagin society. Only female sahuagin are seen as worth of channeling divine power, and male sahuagin clerics are unheard of. The chief concern of sahuagin clergy is the interpretation and maintenance of the tlalloc, an ancient and extremely accurate calendar. The tlalloc is a massive stone or coral disc covered in intricate carvings that also serves as the altar. The priestesses track significant events and preside over holy rites during momentous moments.",
					"The sahuagin religion claims that the first shark people came from a strange place in the deepest trenches of the ocean. Supposedly, these ancient sahuagin carried the first tlalloc calendar stone with them when they emerged from the crushing black depths. Sharks are venerated as the perfect symbol of power, hunger, and dominion over the oceans. Temple structures serve as hatcheries for schools of sharks, and the creatures cluster around the temples awaiting the bidding of the sea devils.",
					"{@b Predators and Prey}",
					"Sahuagin rule their territory ruthlessly and efficiently, demonstrating the most dangerous qualities of intelligent beings and sharks. The sea devils rarely form alliances with outsiders or even other aquatic races of similar temperament, viewing all other ocean-dwellers as competition for food and territory. Parties of sahuagin patrol up to 50 miles from their home settlements on hunting, scouting, and raiding excursions. Non‑sahuagin encountered can expect an inhospitable welcome.",
					"No other race that crosses currents with the sahuagin kindles such extreme and undying hatred in them as the aquatic elves. War between these two races is frequent, prolonged, and bloody. The reason for this mutual hatred is shrouded in mystery, but a connection between the races certainly exists, proved by the existence of the malenti. Malenti are rare sahuagin, sometimes born when a settlement of sea elves exists within close proximity to a sahuagin community. The malenti, though racially sahuagin, look exactly like aquatic elves. Most are killed at birth, but a few survive to serve as spies and assassins who can slip into the ranks of the sea devils' ancient foes.",
