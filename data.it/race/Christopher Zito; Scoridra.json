						"In the case of a player wanting to roleplay more than two Scoridra siblings, with the DM's permission, you may also start with the racial feature Legion.

A Scoridra can hold three heads upon its body, the more heads one has in Scoridra society does elevate the Scoridra in a higher social caste system.",

Contrary to having multiple heads on one body, this act does not tie a Scoridra to Her Majesty by blood or magical means, it was merely a rumor blown out of proportion."

Such creatures are said to follow the will of a eight headed she serpent of great and terrible power that could eradicate all life with a single flame. A savage race with multiple heads whipping around like serpents, molten fire tucked deep within their throats and anger as sharp and ferocious as their sets of gnashing razor like teeth. Yet even the most brave and battle hardened of these adventurers will not fear the might of these creatures that call themselves Scoridra, as the beasts often have to fight their greatest enemies to even accomplish any dastardly scheme the storytellers claim, themselves."

							"Long ago in the realms of fire, a great and terrible beast with eight leviathan-like heads emerged from an exploding volcano, this creature's booming voice summoned forth a meteor shower so grand that the craters left from the devastation molded more volcanoes to rise from the scorched earth. All creatures born of Draconic nature would call this monster \"Her Majesty\" as no force in the realms could stop her. Kingdoms banded together in counsel to devise a way to stop \"Her Majesty\", each attempt to forcefully stop \"Her Majesty\" has met with failure, but then a Dragonborn wizard instead posed an idea. To stop \"Her Majesty\"'s rage, they must instead redirect her rage, but where? Sending her to another realm would be seen as invasion. While that would stoke \"Her Majesty\"'s flames brighter upon others, the wizard shook their head. Would a sacrafice quell her then? While an offering large enough would perhapse have her advert her fire for a brief period, the wizard shook their head. \"Nay, we will direct her rage upon herself.\" Said the wizard and so they traveled to the volcanic birthplace of \"Her Majesty\", calling out to her asking which of \"Her Majesty\"'s heads was the true queen. \"Her Majesty\"'s siblings turned to each other with sneers, unable to decide who among them was the one true queen. Unable to come to terms with themselves, the sisters set their fire upon themselves. With great and powerful blows, \"Her Majesty\" had slayed herself by cutting off her own heads, the wizard acting quickly banished, the heads to dimensions unknown. With her heads servered and her powers scattered to the rift, \"Her Majesty\"'s body fell leaving the corpse as proof of the wizard's victory. The wizard returned home to tell their people of the news of \"Her Majesty\"'s demise, but her blood pouring from her body seeped into the volcano and was left unchecked. As eons pasted, a new race emerged from the lava with the memories of the former queen's rage and the spirit of competition burned deeply upon their souls."

							"While Scoridra are considered one creature, from the neck up they spit into two hydra-esk heads, which are treated as twin brothers or sisters depending on the gender of the Scoridra body. The heads normally are two brothers or two sisters, though while extremely rare, a Scoridra having duel gender heads is possible. However the main body may only take on the genetics of one gender. Both heads control the body in unison and feel the physical effects of the main body, such as feeling nourishment of food, feeling the effects of a curse and being under the influence of alcohol, illness and physical trauma. However the heads are their own personalities with different wants, needs and desires. When interacting with a Scoridra one must consider the brother's or sister's differences in personality and appearances as they will technically be in contact with two siblings in one body. Scoridra are prideful beings and crave validation for their feats in any skillset no matter how trivial or grand. Seeing one sibling act out a great deed will often send the other sibling into a fit of jealous or rage and the siblings will bicker or compete against each other to prove who is the superior sibling. It takes great concentration and will power for Scoridra to cooperate on a matter, but most adventurers who travel with or enlist the aid of the Scoridra find it easier to turning a job into a competition for the siblings to both compete in. That way the Scoridra not only benefits the task at hand but this trickery will also to curb their competitive natures."
