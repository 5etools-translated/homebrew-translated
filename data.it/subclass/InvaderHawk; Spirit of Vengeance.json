You are proficient with the Hellfire Chain, and when using it, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, the essence of your melee pact weapon is infused into the Hellfire Chain, granting it any invocations, bonuses to attack and damage, and magical abilities your pact weapon possesses. You cannot infuse your pact weapon's essence if you have it summoned. Any expanded charges are shared between the Hellfire Chain and your pact weapon.",
