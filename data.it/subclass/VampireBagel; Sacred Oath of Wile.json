				"Those who follow this oath may initially seem to be lawless tricksters and liars, but their behaviour is all but random or malicious. Sometimes known as faerie knights, Knights of the Court and fey knights (much to the chagrin of certain other paladins), these paladins are bound by the strange rules of the Fey. They dedicate themselves to serving these otherworldly masters, swearing to uphold their laws, principles, and ideals a world away from their hidden realms and carrying out their will. Often, these paladins can be found as elite warriors serving in the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, or guarding valuable portals to and from the Feywild, but the nature of their masters means they can be found anywhere on the Material Plane. Their appearance varies, but each carries the iconography of their master on their person, whether it be worked into their armour or emblazoned on an amulet.",
