				"\"I have been in situations where groups I have been assigned to don't have a source of magical healing, and some people take it upon themselves to do the dirty work of being the team medic for an outing. They are still capable warriors, as all adventurers should be. Their knowledge in medical practices have saved several lives. They've acted to patch up the wounded defenders of settlements and to care for the ones who barely return from the carnage of combat. At one point, I was miraculously brought back by one of these physicians. I thought I was gone, but perhaps fate has other plans for me. Even though they don't have any magical abilities to heal, I am grateful for those who persue this practice. I can be pretty brutal on their psyche, but they push through.\"",
