Perhaps some unusual domino effect results in the advantage being granted, or maybe fulfilling the requirement invisibly alters the threads of fate. One thing the requirements should not be, is difficult to accomplish. If you find the requirements are too often unfulfillable in your campaign then you can construct your own table of item interactions."
