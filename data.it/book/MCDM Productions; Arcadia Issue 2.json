						"Watching ARCADIA artists bring the authors' creations to life is one of the best parts of my job. Last issue delivered fantatic mounts, titanic sorcerers, fallen angels, a beautiful harpy cover, and an adventure visualized by the best in the business. This issue brings you more of our artists' remarkable work, as I'm sure you could see from our awesome cover, this time by Ejiwa \"Edge\" Ebenebe.",
						"From the pitch phase of each issue, ARCADIA aims to bring you innovative and actionable fifth edition content from top creators in RPGs. That doesn't just mean story and mechanics. The art in each issue, from the cover to each quarter-page diagram, is just as important to us as the words. Reading Makenzie De Armas's description of a noxa floods the mind with wonderful, alien imagery and possibilities. Without the time and words to describe every single visual detail of the creature, what you picture when you read is likely different than what I imagine. But when Makenzie's evocative description is placed alongside Grace Cheung's illustration of the new elemental, we get two incredible results.",
						"First, we now have a shared idea and standard of what this creature looks like. That's essential for any tabletop RPG. It's why so many players love sharing art of their characters. They want everyone else at the table to picture their hero as they do. For decades GMs have handed out maps and diagrams and held up illustrations to give their players a better idea of how the characters can interact with the story. We aim to give you as much art to play with as we can in ARCADIA.",
						"While quantity is one driving factor for us, more important is quality. RPG art should do more than bring imaginations together. It should make your mind run wild. A good illustration of a monster shows the players what the creature looks like. A great illustration thrills them as they imagine not just what the monster is but what it can be and what it will do. The best RPG design gives you ideas for epic storytelling possibilities. It makes you contact your friends immediately to set up a time to game so you can use that content. Art is no different. The visuals in ARCADIA don't just show you something\u2014they make you wonder what else could be. A lot of that is thanks to the amazing art team at MCDM.",
						"I've learned more about art in the few months I've been working on ARCADIA than I did my entire life before. Executive Art Director Jason Hasenauer and Artist & Outsource Manager Nick De Spain (whose mounts you saw in issue 1) thoughtfully curate each piece. They look over the articles and art suggestions from the authors, myself, and Head of Production Anna Coulter, and select the artists who fit each job. Often that person is Grace Cheung, MCDM's beyond-talented In-House Artist. Other times it is the work of Marlowe Lune, as you'll see in \"Subclasses of the Seasons,\" Diana Muñoz, whose maps appear in \"Well of the Lost Gods,\" or any number of incredible folks we have collaborated with or will in future issues. When all the art is complete, Jen McCleary, one of the most creative graphic and layout designers I've ever worked with, brings it all together into an evocative magazine. I really hope you enjoy digging in as much as we did making it.",

								"Ophira Pyet was once a disgraced conjuration student living alone in an underground laboratory hidden away in the mountains. Surrounded by failed experiments and scribbled arcane equations her teachers vehemently insisted would never work, Ophira turned in desperation to the very earth she stood on. A few preliminary tests uncovered motes of unique elements hidden in the bedrock, and within a week, Ophira managed to pull massive quantities of these elements to the surface and bind them to planar spirits. She dubbed these creatures {@b nova elementals}: new, carefully refined elemental conjurations with specific and dangerous powers.",

Professors who previously shunned her now begged Ophira to teach them her methods of elemental conjuration. But no longer beholden to them as a student, Ophira refused. A few more persistent mages attempted to reverse engineer her process, but they soon realized that without Ophira's precise calculations at hand, these nova elementals would become wild and stubborn, disobeying commands and quickly turning against their summoners.",

										"{@b {@i Ash Cloud.}} Each creature within 30 feet of the fire elemental that is not one of the reactive elementals must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as blustering winds swirl with ash. A creature who fails this saving throw is {@condition blinded} until it uses its action to clear its eyes.",

Each creature within 10 feet of that point that is not one of the reactive elementals must immediately make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 15 ({@damage 3d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) fire damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked {@condition prone}.",

The waves of a water elemental only serve to heighten the explosive sparks that the unstable comburo generates. This team of elementals can take 3 reactivities, choosing from the options below.",
										"{@b {@i Sparks Fly.}} Each creature within 30 feet of the comburo that is not one of the reactive elementals must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw as water splashing onto the comburo erupts into sparks. A creature takes 9 ({@damage 2d8}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
										"{@b {@i Hydroxide Cloud.}} Each creature within 30 feet of the water elemental must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute, as the remnants of the comburo's explosions begin to hiss and form poisonous gas.",
										"{@b {@i Fulmination (Costs 2 Reactivities).}} A massive explosion of searing water, fire, and sparks erupts at a point that both the comburo and the water elemental can see. Each creature within 15 feet of that point that is not one of the reactive elementals must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",

										"{@b {@i Electric Charge.}} The elekron lends some of its lightning energy to the conducere. The conducere makes one Slam attack. If this attack hits, it deals an additional 5 ({@damage 1d10}) lightning damage.",
										"{@b {@i Flash Bang (Costs 2 Reactivities).}} A searing burst of light erupts at a point both the elekron and fire elemental can see. Each creature within 20 feet of that point that is not one of the reactive elementals must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the end of its next turn.",
										"{@b {@i Rapid Conduction (Costs 2 Reactivities).}} This option can only be used if both the elekron and fire elemental are within 30 feet of the conducere. The elekron and fire elemental use the conducere's metallic form as a conduit and immediately swap places. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Once the elekron and the fire elemental appear in their new positions, they can each make one melee attack."
