						"Characters trapped in Barovia as part of the Curse of Strahd storyline season have additional options for being brought back from the dead. When a character under 5th level dies, his or her player has two options. First, an ally can raise the dead character, or pay Jenny Greenteeth to raise the character as a spellcasting service (including seeking her discount). Second, the player can choose to have the Dark Powers of Ravenloft resurrect the character for free. If the player chooses resurrection, the character returns to play at the start of the next round with full hit points and spells. However, this dark resurrection leaves the character tainted by shadow. Roll once on the following table to determine the resurrected character's dark gift. Each time a character dies and takes advantage of this boon, he or she rolls for an additional gift. If this results in the character gaining the same dark gift twice, reroll until you get a different result.",
