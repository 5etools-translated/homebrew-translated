						"Well, here we are at our first stop on the ARCADIA road. From the beginning, we said MCDM planned to make three issues and assess whether or not to keep going. When we began this endeavor, I wasn't sure how the magazine would be received. Did people want more fifth edition content on a regular basis? There's already a lot out there! That's why we needed to do more than just provide content. This magazine needed to be something special with the best writers and artists we could find. So we built an exceptional team, and we liked what we created, but how did you react?",
						"The answer: super positively. I'm writing this letter after the release of issue 1, and already your responses and enthusiasm for the content exceeds my highest hopes. Our Patreon numbers blasted off, we're getting all sorts of love on social media, and you're also finding, following, and praising our authors and artists. You've spoken. You want more ARCADIA, and we'll be giving it to you.",
						"In fact, authors, artists, and playtesters are already cranking on future issues. We're still working out the timeline for releases, but we hope to get you illustrated, edited, playtested content on a regular basis as we fine-tune our process for indefinite production.",
						"ARCADIA is still evolving, and the team does that by listening to you. Our first ARCADIA survey will be available to Patreon patrons shortly after we publish this issue. The results help us pinpoint the most useful and fun content for your gaming table, and let you make requests for articles you'd like to read in the future. We'll also ask you about new content we have ideas for! We want to know what you like, because you help make ARCADIA a hit!",
						"Our Patreon surveys aren't the only place to talk to us about ARCADIA. The MCDM Discord and Reddit communities have great folks talking about all things RPG. (Shoutout to the incredible MCDM community moderators who really make these wonderful places to hang.) In fact, these are great places to go to find fans creating their own content inspired by the magazine. Remember Willy Abeel's \"Jumping on Mounted Combat\" article? You can find a bunch of new mount stat blocks on Reddit inspired by what Willy created. That's just the tip of the incredible iceberg.",
						"With all this talk about the future, I almost forgot to tell you that this issue of ARCADIA is our most ambitious yet. We have four incredible articles for you, all of which focus on new areas of the game for this magazine: a roleplaying-focused mystery adventure from Alison Huang, ten new spells for fifth edition from Celeste Conowitch, three new dream-focused ancestries from Justice Arman, and rules for aerial combat from Sam Mannell. So far we've had dungeon crawls, mysteries, subclasses, spells, ancestries, monsters, and all kinds of new rules. What will we do next? Join our communities. Let us know.",

A humble farmer dreams of faraway riches and trading their spade for a sword. But in the hands of more powerful entities, dreams transcend imagination and become tools of limitless potential. This article presents three new character ancestries inspired by sleep and dreams.",

Dreams are battlegrounds for cosmic defenders and slumbering psionic dragons, waging war against reflections of unfathomable evil in an endless sea of thought.

A lucidling descended from a dominating aboleth may be described as controlling or manipulative, while the child of a gibbering mouther might be loquacious and greedy.
