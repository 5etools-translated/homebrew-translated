						"Bienvenue à Grim Hollow, ou bienvenue à nouveau, si vous avez fait partie de ceux qui ont contribué au succès de notre premier livre, {@i Grim Hollow, The Campaign Guide}. Si vous avez lu le {@i Campaign Guide}, vous savez ce qu'est Grim Hollow. Si ce n'est pas le cas, verrouillez vos portes et tirez vos volets. Rassemblez-vous autour du feu de camp, mais gardez un oeil sur le sous-bois. C'est la pleine lune ce soir !",
						"Le fantastique et l'horreur ont longtemps été les genres préférés des conteurs, sans parler des auditeurs d'histoires. Depuis que les premiers humains se réunissaient autour d'un feu pour inventer des histoires de monstres habitant l'obscurité, la nature sauvage, les mers et les espaces entre les étoiles, nous n'avons jamais perdu le frisson de l'excitation, la montée d'adrénaline de l'effroi, tout en sachant - ou du moins en espérant - que nous sommes à l'abri de tout danger réel.",
						"Grim Hollow et son monde d'Etharis offrent aux fans de jeux de rôle la possibilité de prendre part aux frissons d'un cadre de fantasy sombre. Que la terreur se présente sous la forme des dents et des griffes les plus rouges de la nature, ou la peur qui se propage à travers les actions des mortels lorsqu'ils sont poussés par la soif de pouvoir, ou l'horreur des monstres sans vie qui déambulent dans les nuits sans lune et qui aspirent à éteindre les lumières de la vie, Etharis regorge de menaces parfaites pour de nombreux styles différents de campagnes d'horreur et de dark-fantasy.",
						"Plus important encore, les règles de ce livre fournissent les moyens de permettre aux joueurs d'expérimenter avec leurs personnages, qui font face au plus terrible des destins : succomber aux ténèbres et être changé par elles. La terreur existentielle de devenir un monstre peut faire paraître le combat contre les monstres bien pâle en comparaison.",
						"Nous remercions les 9 138 backers qui nous ont soutenus dans la création de {@i Grim Hollow: The Players Guide}. Votre immense confiance nous a donné les moyens et la motivation de faire de ce livre tout ce qu'il pouvait être. Nous espérons que vous trouverez dans ce livre, que vous soyez joueur ou MJ, les idées et les règles pour créer une campagne qui capture profondément le sentiment des gens qui regardent dans l'obscurité, espérant survivre mais redoutant ce qui pourrait en sortir - ou sortir d'eux-mêmes.",

								"Les jeux de rôle classiques sur table voient souvent les aventuriers traverser hardiment la campagne, traquer le mal dans son repaire et le vaincre au nom de la richesse et de la gloire, protégeant le monde et ses habitants pour un autre jour.",
								"La dark fantasy raconte une histoire différente, et le monde de Grim Hollow invite les participants à imaginer des récits teintés d'ombre, de peur et du drame du désespoir.",
								"Dans le monde d'Etharis, les rôles sont inversés par rapport à une campagne typique de high-fantasy. Ce sont les bons qui se recroquevillent dans leurs fragiles bastions de civilisation tandis que le mal rôde librement sur la terre.

										"Etharis est un monde au bord de la destruction totale. Les dieux sont morts, le feu froid menace de consumer le monde, la ville basse est prête à inonder le monde de dangers surnaturels... n'importe lequel de ces cent événements pourrait être l'étincelle qui met le feu au monde.",
										"Dans un tel monde, comment les héros peuvent-ils exister ? À quoi ressemble la victoire ? Les joueurs qui évoluent dans un tel environnement doivent prendre ces facteurs en considération lors de la création de leur personnage et pendant le jeu lui-même.",
										"Dans la fantasy, l'histoire des personnages tourne rarement autour d'événements heureux et banals. Dans la dark fantasy, ces histoires sont généralement encore plus sombres et dramatiques.",
										"Qu'est-ce qui motive et façonne les protagonistes de la dark fantasy ? La perte d'un être cher. La trahison par les personnes les plus proches d'eux. Des événements désastreux que le personnage s'est senti impuissant à empêcher. Des pouvoirs impénétrables et irrépressibles qui s'étendent et façonnent la vie et la personnalité des personnages avec un mépris froid et malveillant.",
										"Le monde d'Etharis est défini par ces événements horribles, et il va de soi que les personnages qui le composent suivent le mouvement. Comment ces circonstances et ces événements ont-ils conduit à une vie d'aventurier, bravant les dangers que la plupart fuient avec terreur ? Votre personnage est-il devenu amer et cynique, ne s'occupant que de ses propres intérêts ? S'est-il rallié et a-t-il repoussé le désespoir, résolu à se battre pour les dernières lueurs de lumière qui subsistent ? Pour quoi votre personnage se bat-il ?",
										"Ces thèmes se retrouvent également dans le jeu lui-même. Le monde étant en ruines, divers éléments du jeu de rôle normal sont chamboulés. La sécurité devient un terme relatif, de sorte que des sorts tels que {@spell alarm} ou {@spell arcane lock} peuvent s'avérer plus utiles que dans les contextes traditionnels de la high fantasy. Les monstres qui rôdent dans la nature ont réussi à faire disparaître des civilisations entières, d'où l'importance de bien choisir ses combats. Peut-être que toutes les batailles ou rencontres ne valent pas le coût de risquer toute la guerre contre les ténèbres."

										"Les démons parcourent la terre d'Etharis, tordant les destins des mortels à leur guise. Des abominations difformes se cachent dans l'ombre, attendant l'occasion de frapper. Les ténèbres s'infiltrent dans chaque coin et chaque fissure de la façade du monde, chuchotant des promesses de grande puissance à ceux qui sont prêts à répondre... et à se sacrifier. Une vérité durable définit les forces ténébreuses en jeu à Etharis : il y a toujours un prix à payer pour l'aide des puissances obscures.",
										"Créer un personnage dans Grim Hollow, c'est reconnaître le pouvoir des forces des ténèbres. Ce cadre offre un certain nombre d'options pour incorporer ces pouvoirs dans votre personnage. Plutôt que de vous contenter d'obtenir un boon de transformation ou d'utiliser la sangromancie comme vous le feriez avec une compétence supplémentaire, ces options fonctionnent mieux lorsqu'elles sont liées à des événements spécifiques du personnage. Peut-être avez-vous accepté ces pouvoirs avec plaisir pour vous venger de votre personnage, ou peut-être s'agit-il d'un accident involontaire la nuit de la pleine lune. Votre personnage regrette-t-il ces événements ou ces choix ? Ou embrasse-t-il pleinement le pouvoir qu'il a acquis ?",
										"Une fois prises, ces capacités sont notoirement difficiles à gérer. Lorsque vous traitez avec d'autres humanoïdes, révéler votre vraie nature peut causer de sérieux problèmes. Au fur et à mesure que votre pouvoir grandit, sa nature devient de plus en plus difficile à dissimuler et à contrôler, et donc plus difficile d'éviter les conséquences de votre choix. Il peut être utile d'investir dans {@item disguise kit|phb} de compétences ou de capacités telles que {@spell disguise self} afin de mieux se fondre parmi les gens normaux.",
										"Hélas, même cela pourrait ne pas suffire si les circonstances vous obligent à utiliser vos pouvoirs en présence d'autres personnes. Soyez prévenu. Lorsque vous devenez aussi redouté que les forces obscures auxquelles vous vous opposez, les organismes naturels, comme le bout de la fourche d'un fermier, peuvent être tout aussi dangereux que les organismes surnaturels."

										"La disparition des dieux est probablement le plus grand cataclysme qui ait frappé Etharis. Peu de gens connaissent la vérité sur leur chute, à l'exception du panthéon humain, mais tous savent que prier les dieux n'apporte aucune aide et aucun soulagement. La magie divine qui offrait toujours guérison et protection à ceux qui en avaient besoin s'est évanouie, et rares sont ceux qui se souviennent de cet âge d'or.",
										"En tant que joueur, l'extrême rareté de la magie divine offre certains défis à ceux qui souhaitent jouer un clerc ou un paladin. Votre existence même est un événement notable, et vous devriez discuter avec votre MJ de la manière dont vous conservez votre magie et de l'effet que cela est susceptible d'avoir sur le monde dans son ensemble. Les conditions requises pour le multiclassage sont encore plus strictes et doivent être intégrées à l'histoire comme un point majeur de l'intrigue.",
										"La mort des dieux a de graves conséquences, même pour ceux qui ne souhaitent pas participer à une classe divine. Les clercs, les paladins et les organisations religieuses en général sont souvent la principale source de soins et de magie curative dans un jeu de rôle, et leur absence représente donc un défi majeur. Les maladies, les malédictions et d'autres conditions sont beaucoup plus graves lorsque vous ne pouvez pas simplement vous rendre dans le temple le plus proche et faire don d'une somme d'or importante pour les guérir.",
										"De même, la résurrection est une quasi-impossibilité. Les joueurs doivent être conscients que les vies sont d'autant plus précieuses à Etharis. Même les services les plus banals offerts par le clergé, comme donner des bénédictions et vendre de l'eau bénite, sont rares. Les objets utiles pour combattre les légions des ténèbres sont très appréciés, et leur valeur est encore plus grande, ce qui signifie qu'ils doivent être vus et utilisés avec parcimonie."

										"Avec la disparition de la magie divine, les lanceurs de sorts arcaniques sur Etharis se sont retrouvés la cible de la haine et de la méfiance. Une inquisition magique a été lancée dans les provinces de Castinellan, des bureaucraties ont vu le jour pour réglementer et contrôler les mages ailleurs, et des foules ont chassé ceux que les gens du peuple blâmaient pour l'absence des dieux. Alors qu'autrefois ils se plongeaient dans les mystères de l'univers, aujourd'hui les sorciers et leurs proches doivent chercher à assurer leur propre survie.",
										"En tant que joueur créant un lanceur de sorts arcaniques, qu'il s'agisse d'un magicien, d'un sorcier ou d'un sorcier, vous devez faire face à une population superstitieuse et hostile. De nombreuses régions d'Etharis ont institué des systèmes de licence afin de réglementer la magie, de sorte qu'une licence valide est une pièce d'équipement importante pour ceux qui cherchent à pratiquer la magie de manière légitime. Les sorciers sont les principaux lanceurs de sorts autorisés, tandis que les sorciers ne font presque jamais partie d'une organisation ou d'une académie magique. Avec leurs capacités innées, les sorciers se situent entre les deux, avec autant de fugitifs que de praticiens licenciés.",
										"Décidez de la catégorie à laquelle votre personnage appartient et déterminez avec votre MJ les restrictions qui peuvent s'appliquer à votre licence de lanceur de sorts. Même les lanceurs de sorts sous licence ne sont pas totalement exempts du ressentiment des gens du peuple, et brandir une baguette et un livre de sorts au milieu d'une taverne bondée n'est peut-être pas la décision la plus sage.",
										"Si vous ne jouez pas un lanceur de sorts, vous devriez réfléchir à ce que vous pensez de la magie en tant que personnage. Avez-vous grandi dans les provinces de Castinellan, sous le regard sévère des Observateurs des Fidèles ? Ou êtes-vous originaire des Terres du Nord, où la magie est aussi présente dans la vie quotidienne que les forêts et les rivières ? Quelle que soit votre opinion sur la magie des arcanes au début de votre carrière d'aventurier, vous devez également tenir compte de l'évolution de cette opinion au fil du temps. Votre méfiance à l'égard de la magie des arcanes était-elle insensée alors que vous la voyez aujourd'hui maniée par de bons et nobles lanceurs de sorts ? Ou bien vos interactions personnelles avec des lanceurs d'arcanes vous ont-elles appris que la peur des arcanes que vous considériez comme une superstition était au contraire un choix sage et prudent ?"

										"Les aventuriers dans les jeux de rôle sont des voyageurs. C'est une partie intégrante du travail et du jeu dans son ensemble. Normalement, les voyages se déroulent le long d'un réseau de routes bien entretenues et patrouillées, avec des incursions occasionnelles dans la nature sauvage à la recherche d'une vilaine créature qui perturbe l'ordre normal du monde.",
										"Dans un contexte de dark fantasy, on ne peut compter sur les messagers et les patrouilles, et quiconque sort de la sécurité des murs de la ville prend sa vie en main. La nuit est particulièrement dangereuse, car toute lumière sert de balise aux créatures qui attendent dans l'obscurité. Voyager à Etharis n'est pas pour les âmes sensibles, et peut s'avérer être un défi à la hauteur du point culminant de toute histoire.",
										"En tant que personnage bravant les étendues sauvages d'Etharis, la première chose à apprendre est qu'il n'existe pas d'endroit sûr pour camper. À la tombée de la nuit, tout devient une proie facile, il vaut donc mieux être préparé. Il est donc préférable d'être préparé. Monter la garde seul peut ne pas être suffisant, et vous devriez toujours avoir un plan pour réveiller vos alliés afin de faire face aux inévitables complications. Les sorts peuvent vous aider à cet égard, qu'il s'agisse de {@spell alarm}, {@spell magic mouth} ou de l'un des divers sorts soniques qui peuvent être entendus à des centaines de mètres. La vision noire peut être particulièrement utile pour ceux qui montent la garde, afin d'éviter d'annoncer votre présence avec une torche ou un feu de camp. Mais même dans ce cas, la vision dans le noir n'est pas parfaite, et ses limites peuvent donner l'avantage à certaines menaces. Les sorts de défense et de protection, tels que {@spell leomund's tiny hut|PHB|tiny hut} ou {@spell rope trick}, sont précieux pour survivre aux longues randonnées en territoire dangereux.",
										"Une conséquence supplémentaire de l'état d'isolement social d'Etharis : les informations voyagent très lentement. Sans messagers fiables et avec une magie limitée, les aventuriers sont parfois la principale source de communication entre les villages. Cela peut conduire à des problèmes, mais peut aussi fonctionner à l'avantage des personnages s'ils ne veulent pas que la nouvelle de leurs exploits soit diffusée."

										"Lorsqu'ils sont confrontés à des circonstances difficiles, il y a ceux qui se montrent à la hauteur de la situation et agissent par charité en cherchant à aider ceux qui sont dans le besoin. Dans un cadre de fantasy noire, la plupart des gens tombent du mauvais côté de la médaille. Etharis est peuplé principalement de ceux qui ne pensent qu'à eux, souvent au détriment des autres. Qu'il s'agisse de nobles intrigants vivant dans le luxe grâce au dur labeur des autres ou de citadins superstitieux faisant tout ce qui est nécessaire pour ne pas se noyer dans le terrible océan de la pauvreté, les habitants d'Etharis cherchent toujours à tirer profit de tout accord. Dans ce monde, la xénophobie, la paranoïa et la cruauté pure et simple sont à l'ordre du jour.",
										"Traiter avec les PNJ est une pierre angulaire du jeu de rôle, mais les conditions susmentionnées en font une proposition particulièrement risquée dans Etharis. L'aide n'est pas quelque chose de gratuit pour les étrangers que vous rencontrez dans le monde. Même un sourire facile et une langue mielleuse ont leurs limites, alors soyez prêt à traiter avec les gens de manière moins charitable.",
										"La corruption, l'intimidation, la coercition et parfois le chantage pur et simple sont plus courants que les appels à la pitié ou à la sympathie. Savoir ce que veut l'autre personne est une information précieuse lorsqu'on essaie de trouver un arrangement, la sagesse est donc tout aussi importante que le charisme. Les sorts tels que charmer une personne peuvent sembler être une réponse facile, mais la peur et la haine de la magie à Etharis sont amplifiées lorsqu'elles sont utilisées pour usurper la volonté d'une personne. Et ces sorts se dissipent.",
										"La méfiance et la paranoïa qui règnent à Etharis font que certaines capacités, qui n'ont qu'une valeur secondaire dans d'autres types de campagnes ou d'environnements, sont extrêmement précieuses. Les avantages fournis par vos capacités de fond, par exemple, peuvent vous sauver la vie autant qu'une arme rapide ou une boule de feu. Pouvoir compter sur des amis pour un repas et un abri sûr peut être l'un de vos outils les plus puissants lorsque vous traitez avec d'autres personnes, en particulier dans un groupe à faible charisme. La capacité à trouver au moins un visage amical dans une nouvelle ville peut faire la différence entre la vie et la mort."

										"Malgré les nombreuses capacités, les objets magiques et les autres avantages dont dispose un aventurier par rapport au citoyen ordinaire d'Etharis, les personnages doivent toujours faire face à une bataille difficile. Les menaces qui pèsent sur eux sont légion, et beaucoup sont assez fortes pour déchirer le tissu même de la réalité. Par conséquent, les personnages doivent être conscients qu'ils ne sont pas au sommet de la chaîne alimentaire. Le danger est bien réel, et la mort est une possibilité constante. Ceux qui atteignent de grandes hauteurs ne le font qu'après une lutte longue et difficile - et la chute de ces hauteurs est d'autant plus dangereuse.",
										"En termes de jeu, cela signifie que les personnages des joueurs sont relativement plus faibles que dans les campagnes traditionnelles de jeu de rôle fantastique. La progression vers les niveaux supérieurs exige souvent des efforts et des sacrifices plus importants que ceux auxquels certains joueurs sont habitués. C'est un élément de la dark fantasy qui reflète le thème du danger permanent. Lors de la construction d'un personnage, il est sage de ne pas prendre la progression pour acquise et de se concentrer davantage sur la viabilité immédiate. Un personnage qui ne s'épanouira qu'après avoir gagné quatre niveaux pour obtenir le sort ou l'exploit dont vous avez besoin est un personnage qui ne survivra probablement pas aux quatre niveaux.",
										"La planification à long terme est toutefois une option tout à fait envisageable. Bon nombre des options présentées dans ce livre sont conçues dans l'optique d'une progression continue. L'essentiel est de ne pas fonder tous vos espoirs sur l'hypothèse de niveaux futurs. Avec le danger tout autour, l'avenir devient une perspective très incertaine, et il est souvent plus utile de se concentrer sur la survie du présent."

Décider des motivations et des objectifs de votre personnage dans ce monde signifie souvent réduire votre champ d'action. Il y a peu de gloire à trouver, donc les enjeux personnels sont plus appropriés. Qu'il s'agisse de guérir votre frère ou votre sœur malade ou de terminer le travail de votre mentor décédé, Etharis se prête à ces objectifs à court terme et réalisables. Les grandes aventures contre vents et marées pour sauver le monde des maux qui l'entourent... ce sont des histoires pour plus tard."

										"Malgré les circonstances désastreuses auxquelles le monde est confronté, l'espoir demeure. Il peut être dispersé, atténué, assailli de toutes parts, mais il n'a pas été éteint. Un fermier s'oppose aux soldats qui arrivent, donnant à ses amis et à sa famille le temps de fuir. Un marchand, avec un sourire bienveillant, tend une miche de pain à un pauvre mendiant. Un paladin, le dernier de son ordre, poursuit sa quête pour débarrasser le monde d'un prince-démon. A travers Etharis, les petits actes de gentillesse, de bravoure, de charité, se distinguent tous au milieu de la sombre toile de fond. Peu nombreux et espacés, leur rareté ne fait que les rendre plus spéciaux.",
										"Les joueurs doivent également réaliser que les personnages qu'ils rencontrent ne s'attendent pas à une quelconque forme de charité ou de gentillesse de leur part. De tels actes sont généralement accueillis avec suspicion, et les joueurs doivent être prêts à agir en conséquence. Il est possible de défier les attentes des PNJ, en cherchant à les rallier à votre cause. Ou bien, le personnage d'un joueur peut déguiser sa charité afin d'éviter tout conflit qui pourrait compliquer l'affaire, par exemple en glissant des pièces supplémentaires dans une livraison pour que cela semble accidentel."

En faisant ces choix et en relevant les défis tout au long de votre voyage, sachez que chaque chemin que vous emprunterez aura des conséquences, en bien ou en mal. La façon dont vous ferez face aux situations présentées définira votre personnage et l'histoire qui l'entoure. Les gens peuvent changer en fonction de leurs expériences, et un joueur doit prendre en compte tout ce que son personnage a fait pour décider comment il réagira aux choses dans le futur. Certains événements extrêmes peuvent modifier l'alignement, changer les motivations et les objectifs, ou modifier les liens, les idéaux et les défauts d'un personnage de manière surprenante. Accepter la direction que prend votre personnage, même si ce n'est pas celle que vous aviez prévue, se traduit souvent par une expérience plus enrichissante.",
										"Vos décisions façonneront également votre version d'Etharis. Les personnages que vous rencontrez peuvent apparaître plus tard pour influencer des moments importants de l'histoire. La nouvelle de vos actes se répand, bien que lentement, entre les colonies. Les MJ peuvent définir l'intrigue générale d'une campagne, mais vos actions fournissent les éléments de base qu'ils utiliseront à l'avenir. De cette façon, les personnages et le monde qui les entoure se renforcent mutuellement pour former un récit complet et cohérent. Etharis est, par-dessus tout, un monde de choix difficiles et de conséquences graves. Choisissez avec sagesse."

Tout semble aller pour le mieux, mais quelques semaines plus tard, le charme s'estompe et la véritable horreur est révélée : l'enfant a été volé par les fées et un wechselkind a pris sa place. Les fées sont des êtres impitoyables et immuables, aussi rien n'éveille leur fascination (et leur envie) plus que l'étincelle malléable et brillante d'un jeune enfant humain.",
								"Un wechselkind est une construction faite de bois, d'argile et de céramique sous la forme d'un petit enfant, animé par la magie des fées et dissimulé dans un charme qui le fait paraître identique à un bébé mortel volé. Lorsque le charme s'estompe et que le mensonge est révélé, le wechselkind est souvent chassé par sa famille d'accueil, voire détruit.",

Ayant peu de besoins physiques, le wechselkind erre souvent d'un endroit à l'autre, observant les gens qu'il rencontre avec des yeux envieux, dans l'espoir d'un endroit où il pourra enfin s'intégrer.",

Grâce à leur immunité à la maladie, un certain nombre de wechselkind ont offert leurs services en tant qu'infirmiers et assistants médicaux dans les régions frappées par la peste, gagnant la reconnaissance et les éloges de ceux qui sont capables de voir au-delà de leurs débuts tragiques. Ces wechselkind sont reconnaissants d'avoir un but et un lieu d'appartenance, mais ils restent prudents. Lorsqu'ils ne sont plus utiles, ils savent qu'ils peuvent être chassés une fois de plus.",

Ils communiquent avec les esprits pour être guidés et n'ont pas peur d'affronter la mort sur le champ de bataille. Humanoïdes pâles aux crinières de varech, ils recherchent la dualité sous-jacente de tout ce qu'ils rencontrent. Un laneshi est plus enclin à voir les choses de manière absolue et à réagir en conséquence. Ami ou ennemi. Jour ou nuit. Acceptation ou rejet. Toutes les choses doivent avoir leur place, et à cette fin, ils ont développé un système de castes rigide.",
								"La caste mystique comprend tous les laneshi qui sont nés jumeaux, ce qui est très fréquent. Lorsque cela se produit, le premier-né de la paire est intronisé dans la caste mystique, tandis que l'autre jumeau est consacré comme guide spirituel de son frère ou de sa sœur. Grâce à un puissant rituel nécromantique, le second jumeau est sacrifié et son âme est liée au corps de l'autre. Chaque membre de la caste mystique est donc possédé de deux âmes : une vivante et une morte. Cela leur confère une vision du monde des esprits et renforce leurs capacités nécromantiques. Les mystiques sont responsables de tout ce qui ne possède pas de vie, et sont donc en charge des rites funéraires, de l'artisanat, de la construction, de la tenue des registres et de la préparation des aliments. Les tâches les plus lourdes sont généralement effectuées avec l'aide de morts-vivants.",

Cela inclut non seulement la guerre, mais aussi le gouvernement, la diplomatie, l'agriculture, l'élevage et l'éducation des enfants, et ainsi de suite. La caste des guerriers est environ deux fois plus nombreuse que la caste des mystiques et est structurée comme une méritocratie, les grandes actions menant à un statut plus élevé. Les laneshi sont constamment en guerre contre leurs voisins des profondeurs, et utilisent leur capacité à parler avec la faune marine pour trouver des opportunités d'héroïsme et d'avancement.",

Les récits d'aventure abondent où le protagoniste reçoit les conseils d'un ogresh avant de partir en quête, et d'autres encore décrivent des conseillers royaux dotés d'un ensemble distinctif de traits larges. Indépendamment de la véracité de ces récits, les ogresh existent toujours sur le continent, considérés comme une sorte de curiosité exotique.",
								"En vérité, la rareté des ogresh est le résultat de leur biologie particulière. Les jeunes ogresh mûrissent lentement, et pendant leur jeunesse prolongée, qui peut durer des décennies, ils sont animés d'un profond sentiment d'errance. Ce sentiment les pousse à voyager à la recherche d'une zone appropriée pour s'installer, comprenant de nombreuses ressources naturelles, une population locale de créatures sensibles, et une absence d'autres ogresh à proximité. Une fois qu'ils ont choisi une région, les ogresh entrent dans la deuxième phase de leur vie, qui est marquée par un appétit considérablement accru et un mode de vie essentiellement sédentaire. Plus d'un seul ogresh pourrait facilement épuiser le surplus d'un petit village, donc la raison de leur envie de voyager est un simple cas de nécessité biologique.",
								"Étant donné leur dépendance à l'égard des autres espèces, il n'est pas surprenant que les ogresh soient des maîtres de l'interaction sociale. Chaque individu est né avec une capacité inhérente à lire le langage corporel et les signaux vocaux qui aident à discerner l'attitude des autres. En effet, les vastes réserves de connaissances souvent attribuées aux ogresh sont le reflet de leur étrange capacité à glaner des informations sur un individu grâce à ces indices subtils. Une simple conversation peut finir par révéler bien plus que ce que l'on pensait à ces fins observateurs, et les ogresh sont assez intelligents pour tirer profit de ces informations.",

Ces archi-séraphins étaient les lieutenants les plus puissants parmi les hôtes angéliques, suffisamment forts pour conserver un semblant de pouvoir après la tragédie. Les anges de moindre importance n'eurent pas cette chance. Nombre d'entre eux se retrouvèrent totalement dépourvus de leurs pouvoirs, rejetés sur Etharis pour y vivre leur vie désormais mortelle au milieu des races inférieures.",

Parmi ceux qui restent, certains servent encore les archi-séraphins dans leurs croisades tordues, dans l'espoir de récupérer ce qu'ils ont perdu. D'autres ont tourné le dos à leurs anciens camarades pour chercher leurs propres objectifs, embrassant pleinement la vie mortelle. Enfin, il y a ceux qui se sentent aigris par leur chute et qui ont été acceptés avec joie par les archidémons comme agents pour répandre la peur et la destruction.",

Ce pouvoir se souvient encore de l'ancienne fonction du défunt et peut être exploité en cas de grand besoin pour aider ceux qui faisaient autrefois appel aux dieux pour leur pouvoir. Cette capacité est aussi dangereuse qu'elle est puissante, car nombreux sont ceux qui cherchent à la prendre par la force. Les membres du clergé déchus qui cherchent à drainer les malheureux afin de restaurer leurs propres pouvoirs défaillants, les vampires qui cherchent à s'abreuver à une fontaine de divin contaminé, et même ceux qui traitent avec de puissantes entités étrangères à ce monde, sont tous des prédateurs potentiels pour un ange déchu.

L'endroit où vivent aujourd'hui les nains de Stehlenwald était autrefois le siège d'un ancien empire qui surpassait tous ceux qui sont venus depuis.

Leur long sommeil les a laissés étrangement énergisés et capables de travailler au-delà de l'endurance légendaire des nains.

Les Gardiens du Cœur nient l'existence d'un tel être et interdisent toute discussion à son sujet. Les rumeurs concernant cette menace sont considérées comme une grave insulte à l'Eglise, et conduisent sans aucun doute la personne qui en parle derrière les barreaux. En même temps, les Gardiens du Cœur ont fait de la rétention de toute information concernant la Bête un crime grave. Toute rencontre avec l'entité doit être signalée aux Gardiens du Cœur, et toute sa progéniture monstrueuse doit être détruite.

										"Longtemps désigné comme le point central des études magiques dans l'Empire, le Nordenland est politiquement divisé en son centre. Le Nordenland de l'Ouest s'est déclaré loyal à l'Empire de Bürach, tandis que le Nordenland de l'Est a profité de la distraction de l'Empire pour se déclarer État indépendant. Il existe deux villes capitales : Erlefurt à l'Ouest, et Ulmirac à l'Est.",
										"Bien qu'une trêve difficile règne entre les deux factions, le schisme reste aussi profond que jamais, les deux camps maintenant des troupes à leurs frontières. Les voyageurs, et surtout les aventuriers, ont du mal à traverser la frontière entre l'Est et l'Ouest, car les deux camps soupçonnent rapidement les étrangers d'espionner pour l'autre camp.",
										"La politique n'est pas la seule chose pour laquelle les Norden sont claniques. Ils sont également divisés en termes d'éducation magique. En effet, l'enseignement des arcanes est la principale exportation de la province, les deux camps formant sans relâche leur propre marque d'utilisateurs de la magie.",
										"Le West Nordenland est spécialisé dans la magie des arcanes. La ville d'Erlefurt a commencé comme un collège de mage, formant des sorciers pendant de nombreuses années avant de devenir une ville. Depuis, huit écoles de sorciers ont vu le jour dans le Nordenland et, bien que l'obtention d'un diplôme dans l'une d'entre elles soit considérée comme un grand honneur, le collège des mages d'Erlefurt est considéré comme la principale institution de magie des arcanes, rivalisant uniquement avec le sanctuaire de Ravencourt à Ostoya. Les parchemins, les livres de sorts et divers objets magiques abondent dans les boutiques le long de Viternas Lane. L'archiduchesse Maelfa et son magistrat s'attachent à former davantage de mages afin de consolider son importance au sein de la famille impériale et de tenir l'Est en échec.",
										"Pendant ce temps, le Nordenland de l'Est puise sa magie entièrement dans le monde naturel. La capitale d'Ulmirac abrite l'Ordre du Rameau d'Or, la plus puissante secte de druides de l'Empire. Presque tout ce qu'il faut savoir sur la nature se trouve dans leur bibliothèque des arbres. Des potions, des ingrédients et des herbes de toutes sortes peuvent être trouvés au marché de Silverine.",
										"Alfric, patriarche du Cercle d'Oaken, maintient l'ordre tout en encourageant ses citoyens à vivre en harmonie avec le monde naturel. Ainsi, le Cercle maintient des frontières magiques protectrices sur les forêts du Nordenland de l'Est, mais même celles-ci sont en train d'échouer à cause de la puissance de la Grande Bête.",
										"En effet, la seule chose qui empêche les Norden d'entrer en guerre civile est la menace permanente de la Bête. L'entité semble plus active dans le Nordenland que dans n'importe quelle autre province, de grandes parties des forêts ayant été transformées en un paysage infernal tordu peuplé de monstruosités corrompues.",
										"Contrairement aux Abendlanders, les Norden reconnaissent la menace de la Bête et donnent la priorité à sa destruction. À cette fin, ils offrent des richesses et des secrets magiques à quiconque peut aider à récupérer les artefacts impériaux perdus qui ont donné naissance à cette monstruosité."

Le feu froid se développe alors et se répand rapidement dans une conflagration bleue. On l'a vu consommer de la chair, du cuir, de l'herbe, du bois, de la mousse et des os.

Lorsque Liesech n'était rien de plus qu'une petite ville de pêcheurs endormie, le patriarche, Otto Bouwengracht, a rencontré une étrange entité connue sous le nom de la Gazeuse d'immondices. La créature proposa un marché à Otto : elle lui donnerait les moyens de transformer Liesech en une ville d'une richesse incommensurable, et en échange, elle serait autorisée à se nourrir de ses déchets, y compris de ses cadavres. Otto accepta, et grâce à leur contrat, Liesech commença à prospérer. En même temps, Otto a commencé un culte pour adorer et nourrir la faim sans fin de la créature.",

Bientôt, les navires de Liesech dominaient tout l'Etharis occidental.",

À cette fin, ils ont fait appel à un vampire captif, la comtesse Analita von Raiza, pour entrer à Liesech et utiliser ses pouvoirs pour soumettre la famille Bouwengracht à sa volonté. Grâce à leur influence, la ville se laisserait annexer par l'Empire.",
												"Mais l'Empire avait sous-estimé le pouvoir et le désir de vengeance de la comtesse. Le jour de la célébration annuelle de la Mer nourricière, elle massacra toute la famille Bouwengracht, un crime odieux qui fut connu sous le nom de Matin rouge. Avec cela, Analita a usurpé le contrôle de la ville."

										"As these newborn mortals turned their minds to their creators, the gods found an endless font of believers. Their worship lifted the gods to greater heights, securing their ability to turn the wheel of the universe.",
										"But the gods were not alone. At the fringes of their ordered realm lurked the Aether Kindred\u2014incomprehensible beings of pure chaos who predated the gods themselves. The Kindred were mostly content to remain uninvolved, thought occasionally the gods would find a piece of reality in disarray\u2014a star gone missing, an ocean dried up, an entire city disappearing into the void.",

										"None can say precisely what happened to the gods who participated in the war. Some historians say it was a slaughter. Others believe the gods were consumed by the eldritch horrors they tried to defeat. Others state that some gods retreated from this plane to someplace the Kindred could not reach them. While nothing is certain about what happened to the gods thereafter, it is quite certain they were utterly defeated.",
										"Of the great pantheon, only the four youngest survived: Galt the Builder, Maligant Warclad, Ulmyr the Wise, and Aurelia of the Hearth. Perhaps out of caution or fear, they held back from the Aetheric War. Thus, they were the only ones left to pick up the pieces, becoming responsible for the fostering of Etharis's future.",

It's believed these horrors slept deeply after destroying so many of the gods, perhaps requiring rest to heal from their wounds. But once they have regenerated, they will likely take revenge on the rest of the gods' creations.",
										"Whatever the reason, this left the Four Divines to their own devices. As the surviving gods left to guide the mortals of Etharis, they decided to band together. Their idea was to create an ideal empire, the \"one above all\" to act as a shining beacon for all mortals to emulate. This idea became the Bürach Empire. Its first emperor, Indorius I, would be the lightbringer for all the nations of Etharis. To this end, the Four Divines gifted him with four holy artifacts that would enable him to rule wisely and protect his empire.",
										"For a time, all was good. Unfortunately, this method of salvation carried the seeds of its own destruction. The Bürach Empire so loved their emperor that they decided to keep his bloodline eternally pure. The Church of the Hearthkeepers imposed the Edict of Eternal Blood, mandating that only those of the line of Indorius I may ascend to the throne. With that, they forced his descendants to intermarry, weakening their blood. The wretched outcome of this practice finally manifested in the Mad Emperor, Leopold.",
										"When Leopold touched the divine artifacts, his mind and soul were instantly connected with the Four Divines\u2014and it drove them all to madness. Galt, Malignant, Ulmyr, and Aurelia warred among themselves, each vying to reign as the One True God of the universe. This culminated in the Gods' End, when these last remaining deities destroyed one another.",

Thus they imparted too much of their power into the substances they made and accidentally breathed life into. This act is how the Primordials came to be.",
										"Chief of the Primordials is a being known as Gormadraug, a tiny being that carried a spark of the gods' divinity. Gormadrag amused the gods so they kept it as a pet. Over time, their treatment became abusive, using Gormadraug for hunting sport, slaying and resurrecting him over and over. Finally, when they tired of him, they abandoned him on the newly formed Etharis.",
										"For millennia, Gormadraug devoured everything he could see: rocks, ice, lava, and air. With every century, he grew larger, until finally, he emerged as a colossal Wyrm with power over all the elements. So powerful was he that could spawn his own children, themselves powerful Primordials.",
										"However, he never forgot his treatment at the hands of the gods. He nursed his hatred for a millennia. The final straw was when the gods declared that the new race of mortals would inherit all of Etharis. Gormadraug sought his revenge by sending his Primordials to war against the gods.",
										"Despite his numerous spawn, they were not powerful or plentiful enough to achieve his goal. The gods handily defeated the Primordials. Gormadraug survived, however, and went into hiding.",
										"This setback did have one upside for the Great Wyrm: it emboldened the gods to believe they could fight the Aether Kindred as well. The debacle that followed left Etharis with only four remaining gods.",
										"Gormadraug wasted no time: he created four new spawn that he would use to fight a new war on the gods and their mortal children. These Primordials were Alondo of the Deep, Morrakesh the Burning Lady, Citrolach the Living Mountain, and Ilhara the Queen of Air and Shadow.",
										"This time, Gormadraug aimed to win. He became as cruel to his children as the gods were to him. To strengthen them, he forced them to compete with each other endlessly, killing each other in an arena of death and resurrection.",
										"The four Primordials endured centuries of this treatment, each one aching to be free of their sire. They found their opportunity from an unexpected source: a man named Kentigern and his six companions, seeking to tame the northern wilderness for habitation.",
										"Alondo convinced his siblings to betray their sire and take the adventurers under their wing. Morrakesh and Citrolach formed powerful magic weapons that could pierce Gormadraug's flesh. Ilhara composed for them a magic song that would put the Wyrm to sleep. Alondo taught them enchantments that would keep them alive, and he also told them where to strike Gormadraug's heart.",
										"Thus, Kentigern and his companions were able to slay Gormadraug. His body was destroyed, save for his indestructible heart, which was thrown into the northern sea and formed an island. Subsequently, the four Primordials divided Etharis among themselves and formed their own realms. Citrolach and Morrakesh settled along the equator, while Alondo and Ilhara resided closer to the poles.",
										"Yet all four Primordials know that their sire had not truly perished, but merely slumbered in a state of hibernation. Even now, mortals obtain command over the elements from the Prismatic Wyrm. The day may come when Gormadraug would awaken and wreak his vengeance across Etharis. They continually seek ways to prevent this from happening. Yet with the appearance of coldfire, it seems the Prismatic Wyrm's resurrection is coming ever closer."

For this reason, it is appropriate for the level of dice in the Beast Pool to be represented in-game, allowing the characters to react without metagaming and breaking immersion.",
								"One way to accomplish this is by interactions with NPCs. News may reach the party of some supernatural phenomenon which has the locals on edge, or the party's local informant warns them of an increase in monster attacks. Other times the party's surroundings themselves change to represent the growing threat. Omens and portents foretell disaster, and the creatures the party encounters take on a more disturbing appearance.",

Furthermore, certain actions may result in the reward of a Resolve Die if they represent events which would bolster the party's determination.

								"As always, these rules are offered as suggestions. We strongly recommend groups expand upon and customize these rules to best fit the themes and playstyle of their game.",
								"One way in which a group may do this is by relaxing the rules limiting Resolve and Beast Abilities to the party and GM, respectively. In certain circumstances it may make sense to allow party members to use abilities listed under the Beast Pool, such as when their actions align with the goals of the villain, and a GM may want to dip into the Resolve Abilities to boost the difficulty of an encounter.",
								"Another method of customization is by altering the abilities themselves. The Outnumbered ability from the Beast Pool, for example, can easily be adapted to summoning spells and moved over to the Resolve Pool. Inner Strength can be used to boost the healing of a fighter's Second Wind ability or to increase the level of a {@spell cure wounds} spell. Summoning the Beast can easily be swapped out for an appearance by whatever villain the GM has set as the primary antagonist of the campaign. All of these are appropriate uses of Influence Dice.",
								"Depending on the actions of the party and the GM, there may be a situation where a pool of dice fills completely and stays there for an extended period of time. One option to prevent this disparity is to allow a trade-off between the two. When a player would gain a Resolve Die, they may instead choose to decrease the Beast Pool by one. Similarly, when the GM would add a die to the Beast Pool, the increase in threat can be represented just as well by decreasing the Resolve Pool by one. This provides for a more fluid interplay between the two pools, acting almost like a tug-of-war on the weave of Fate's tapestry.",
								"As a final note, one bit of warning regarding these rules: in general, pitting party members against one another is something to be avoided. If you want to include this as an option in your game, or if you contemplate using some of these rules to that effect, we strongly recommend discussing this with your group ahead of time to make sure that everyone agrees with the idea. The most important thing is to have fun, and the rules should serve that goal, even if they have to be bent or broken at times."

News may reach the party of some supernatural phenomenon which has the locals on edge, or the party's local informant warns them of an increase in monster attacks.

Omens and portents foretell disaster, and the creatures the party encounters take on a more disturbing appearance.",

						"Another method of customization is by altering the abilities themselves. The Outnumbered ability from the Beast Pool, for example, can easily be adapted to summoning spells and moved over to the Resolve Pool. Inner Strength can be used to boost the healing of a fighter's Second Wind ability or to increase the level of a {@spell cure wounds} spell. Summoning the Beast can easily be swapped out for an appearance by whatever villain the GM has set as the primary antagonist of the campaign. All of these are appropriate uses of Influence Dice.",
						"Depending on the actions of the party and the GM, there may be a situation where a pool of dice fills completely and stays there for an extended period of time. One option to prevent this disparity is to allow a trade-off between the two. When a player would gain a Resolve Die, they may instead choose to decrease the Beast Pool by one. Similarly, when the GM would add a die to the Beast Pool, the increase in threat can be represented just as well by decreasing the Resolve Pool by one. This provides for a more fluid interplay between the two pools, acting almost like a tug-of-war on the weave of Fate's tapestry.",
						"As a final note, one bit of warning regarding these rules: in general, pitting party members against one another is something to be avoided. If you want to include this as an option in your game, or if you contemplate using some of these rules to that effect, we strongly recommend discussing this with your group ahead of time to make sure that everyone agrees with the idea. The most important thing is to have fun, and the rules should serve that goal, even if they have to be bent or broken at times."

Humanoïdes pâles aux crinières de varech, ils recherchent la dualité sous-jacente de tout ce qu'ils rencontrent. Un laneshi est plus enclin à voir les choses de manière absolue et à réagir en conséquence. Ami ou ennemi. Jour ou nuit. Acceptation ou rejet.

Lorsque cela se produit, le premier-né de la paire est intronisé dans la caste mystique, tandis que l'autre jumeau est consacré comme guide spirituel de son frère ou de sa sœur. Grâce à un puissant rituel nécromantique, le second jumeau est sacrifié et son âme est liée au corps de l'autre. Chaque membre de la caste mystique est donc possédé de deux âmes : une vivante et une morte. Cela leur confère une vision du monde des esprits et renforce leurs capacités nécromantiques. Les mystiques sont responsables de tout ce qui ne possède pas de vie, et sont donc en charge des rites funéraires, de l'artisanat, de la construction, de la tenue des registres et de la préparation des aliments. Les tâches les plus lourdes sont généralement effectuées avec l'aide de morts-vivants.",

La caste des guerriers est environ deux fois plus nombreuse que la caste des mystiques et est structurée comme une méritocratie, les grandes actions menant à un statut plus élevé. Les laneshi sont constamment en guerre contre leurs voisins des profondeurs, et utilisent leur capacité à parler avec la faune marine pour trouver des opportunités d'héroïsme et d'avancement.",

Indépendamment de la véracité de ces récits, les ogresh existent toujours sur le continent, considérés comme une sorte de curiosité exotique.",

Les jeunes ogresh mûrissent lentement, et pendant leur jeunesse prolongée, qui peut durer des décennies, ils sont animés d'un profond sentiment d'errance. Ce sentiment les pousse à voyager à la recherche d'une zone appropriée pour s'installer, comprenant de nombreuses ressources naturelles, une population locale de créatures sensibles, et une absence d'autres ogresh à proximité. Une fois qu'ils ont choisi une région, les ogresh entrent dans la deuxième phase de leur vie, qui est marquée par un appétit considérablement accru et un mode de vie essentiellement sédentaire. Plus d'un seul ogresh pourrait facilement épuiser le surplus d'un petit village, donc la raison de leur envie de voyager est un simple cas de nécessité biologique.",

Chaque individu est né avec une capacité inhérente à lire le langage corporel et les signaux vocaux qui aident à discerner l'attitude des autres. En effet, les vastes réserves de connaissances souvent attribuées aux ogresh sont le reflet de leur étrange capacité à glaner des informations sur un individu grâce à ces indices subtils. Une simple conversation peut finir par révéler bien plus que ce que l'on pensait à ces fins observateurs, et les ogresh sont assez intelligents pour tirer profit de ces informations."

Ce pouvoir se souvient encore de l'ancienne fonction du défunt et peut être exploité en cas de grand besoin pour aider ceux qui faisaient autrefois appel aux dieux pour leur pouvoir. Cette capacité est aussi dangereuse qu'elle est puissante, car nombreux sont ceux qui cherchent à la prendre par la force. Les membres du clergé déchus qui cherchent à drainer les malheureux afin de restaurer leurs propres pouvoirs défaillants, les vampires qui cherchent à s'abreuver à une fontaine de divin contaminé, et même ceux qui traitent avec de puissantes entités étrangères à ce monde, sont tous des prédateurs potentiels pour un ange déchu.

				"Lorsque les humains ont pris le pouvoir et ont commencé à menacer les elfes et les nains, les nains de Stehlenwald ont été contraints de creuser plus profondément dans leurs forteresses montagneuses afin de résister au siège. Au plus profond de l'obscurité, même sous l'adamantine qui s'est avérée être leur salut, les nains ont trouvé des chambres scellées datant d'avant le cataclysme. Une fois le sceau brisé, un ancien sort a été levé et les habitants des chambres ont commencé à sortir de leur sommeil millénaire.",
				"Dans les jours précédant la calamité qui a anéanti leur civilisation, un groupe de ces \"rêveurs\" a prévu le danger et a élaboré un plan pour y survivre. Le temps passe différemment dans les rêves, et les anciens ont cherché à utiliser ce fait pour se libérer du flux du temps. Suspendus entre la réalité et les rêves, scellés sous terre, ils pouvaient vivre dans un état de sommeil perpétuel aussi longtemps que nécessaire et survivre à la catastrophe qui anéantirait le reste de leur espèce.",
				"Le plan a fonctionné, mais vivre aussi longtemps dans le monde des rêves a eu des conséquences imprévues. Au réveil, les rêveurs se sont aperçus qu'ils ne pouvaient plus faire la différence entre les rêves et les souvenirs, les deux s'effaçant rapidement de leur esprit. Il en résulta l'émergence d'une nouvelle race qui n'avait aucune connaissance de sa propre histoire, mais seulement des images en demi-teinte et des impressions oniriques d'un lieu et d'une époque qui n'ont peut-être jamais existé.",
				"Aujourd'hui, les rêveurs luttent pour s'adapter à un monde qui ressemble à un cauchemar éveillé. Quelle que soit leur histoire, ils ont prouvé qu'ils étaient vifs d'esprit et forts, capables d'apprendre de nouvelles tâches et de les exécuter correctement. Leur long sommeil les a laissés étrangement énergisés et capables de travailler au-delà de l'endurance légendaire des nains. Malgré tout, c'est dans le sommeil que les rêveurs se sentent le plus à l'aise, et ils ont l'habitude de s'assoupir rapidement dès qu'aucune tâche immédiate ne se présente."

				"Projeter son esprit dans les plans extérieurs est le rêve de nombreux lanceurs de sorts. Récemment, aucun ne s'est approché de cet honneur douteux comme la cité perdue d'Ulmyr's Gate. Fondée par un groupe de sorciers ambitieux qui souffraient des limitations imposées par la bureaucratie gouvernementale, la Porte d'Ulmyr offrait une étude gratuite à tous les mages qui cherchaient refuge entre ses murs. Le Grand Collège est rapidement devenu un lieu d'accueil pour les mages de toutes sortes venus de tout l'empire, et pendant un bref moment, un âge d'or de la magie a existé.",
				"Ce rêve s'est effondré une nuit lorsque les mages fondateurs de la Porte d'Ulmyr ont tenté un énorme rituel de conjuration destiné à ouvrir le voile et à créer un portail permanent vers le plan éthéré. Cela n'a pas fonctionné. Au lieu de cela, leur magie a provoqué une faille dans le tissu même de la réalité, et en un instant, la ville entière a basculé dans le vide entre les mondes. La ville entière a été présumée morte, l'Inquisition arcaniste s'est insurgée contre l'orgueil démesuré de ceux qui manipulaient des choses que l'homme n'était pas censé connaître, et la vie dans l'Empire a continué.",
				"Des années plus tard, on a entendu parler de personnes étranges aperçues dans la région où se trouvait la Porte d'Ulmyr. Ces personnes semblaient étrangement floues ou indistinctes, et certains rapports disaient qu'elles disparaissaient sous les yeux des témoins. Peu à peu, il est apparu que ces pauvres âmes étaient les survivants de la Faille éthérée, désormais coincés entre les mondes et tentant de conserver leur faible emprise sur le plan matériel."
