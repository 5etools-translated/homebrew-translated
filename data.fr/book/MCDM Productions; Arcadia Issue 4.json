The Chained Library's own version, sealed in a marble vault in the deepest depths of the archive, attributes its founding to Archmage Valistus. It is written that Valistus' apprentice, Ravelin, gave himself over to the study of dark magic. Valistus intervened, sealing away his apprentice's spellbooks and research, along with all the tomes and scrolls he used to guide his studies. Valistus summoned and bound celestial creatures of unwavering morals to guard them. In time, other mages and scholars presented Valistus with dangerous texts that could damn the world.",
						"Now, the Chained Library sends out agents to find and claim more dangerous books. The library's judgement is strict and their agents persistent: once the librarians determine that a book must be taken into their secure storage, they work tirelessly to obtain it, regardless of how it's being used; a book of necromancy used to cure a plague is still an evil book, and must be shut away. Occasionally a visitor who proves their wisdom and moral character might be allowed to peruse a tome or two, under supervision, but knowledge taken into the library is effectively lost forever. However, the library never destroys a text: knowledge is sacred, and any information might serve a purpose in the future.",

A creature who fails the save must also roll one Hit Die. Its hit point maximum is permanently reduced by the amount on the die, and its Hit Dice are permanently reduced by one.
