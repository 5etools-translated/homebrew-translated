						"Mortals and gods alike have been playing games of luck since the dawn of times. Sometimes for leisure, other times for determining dramatic outcomes. In ancient times, Jergal bequeathed his kingdoms of undeath after a game of knuckbones. Zeus allocated divine domains to his sibilings by a random draw. Romulus and Remus settled tehir dispute by watching the skies for birds. When it comes to taking arbitrary decisions, a game of chance is the fairest of all.",
						"most of the these games are harmless played across the multiverse for entertainment purposes. Others, riskiers, are carried on by daredevil or malevolent creatures. The runic roulette belongs to the latter category.",

Not everyone knows about the runic roulette, but rumors have been circulating in lands where there are men fearless or desparate enough to play it. Professional gamblers, crooks and the authorities who have to deal with them have generally more chances to know about this game. A moderately difficult interaction check wiht one of this characters, or proficiency with a gaming set may allow a character to be aware of the existence of the runic roulette. Within closed circles, folks are eager to spread the following rumors:",

										"Most civilized settlements banish its practice for fear of hosting an unpredictable outburst of raw magic and tearing the weave. Legends tell of shady inns too tolerating of the game, which staff and patrons were turned into infernal spawns during the nightmare. This game would most likely the place in a foul den or a pirate ship.",
										"Like a pact with the devil, a game of runic roulette is the opportunity to acquire miraculous results in no time and no effort. Players are looking for wealth, power, or simply the demise of their adversary. Sadly the player's own demise is more likely. The outcome of a session is often intense, if not violent of fully macabre.",
