The spell causes the wagon to become completely impervious to water for the duration of the spell, even though the physical material that the wagon is made from may contain physical holes or other damage that would normally allow water to pass through unimpeded."

				"When you cast this spell, any wet objects or creatures within the ritual's area of effect will slowly dry out as though left in the warm summer sun. The spell effect lasts up to 8 hours, however many things will be well and truly dried out after only an hour or so. Discuss with your DM exactly how long it will take for your objects and creatures to dry.",
				"One unique feature of this ritual is that, in written form in a spell book, the spell instructions are completely impervious to water damage. If a spell book ever becomes waterlogged, this spell will remain completely readable. Casting it on the wet spell book will dry out the book and return it to its pre-water damaged state, ensuring all spells contained within the book are useable in the future."
