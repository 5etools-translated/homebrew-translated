								"The Process of enchanting a tattoo is not wholly different from the process of acquiring a tattoo. DM's can decide at their own discretion who has the power to enchant tattoos for their players; either fold the practice into the artists, give specialist wizards and sorcerers the power, or find another way to hand out enchantments.",
								"The enchanting process should ultimately be more expensive than the process of acquiring a tattoo in order to gate the more powerful enchantments from lower level players.",
								"Key to the process of enchanting a tattoo is the system through which the enchantment can be utilised. In order to make use of the enchantment, PCs must attune to the tattoo over the period of a short rest as they would an item. This system allows players a new source of magical effects while preventing late game parties from purchasing full body tattoos that give them intense stat boosts. Through this system, PCs will not be able to attune to more than three tattoos at a time, however, will be able to benefit from the magical effects of items that do not require attunement in slots that they would otherwise be utilising attunement items. Additionally, they can tattoo themselves with as many tattoos as their body will allow meaning they can customise their active enchantments to suit a situation over a short rest.",
								"The final factor that comes into play in the enchanting process is the power an enchantment can reach. Depending on the game, you might want to gate enchantments into three tiers with three different price points. A low tier enchantment being available at level 5, medium at level 10, and high at level 15. If a player recieves a low level enchantment that becomes redundant at a higher level, a second visit to an enchanter could perhaps upgrade the enchantment. You could also gate the enchantment power depending on the size and location of the tattoo if you so choose. Perhaps you give players access to a high level enchantment early but in return they had to commit to a full back tattoo that restricts further tattoos in that location.",
								"Ultimately, if you're using this system it is incredibly important to consider what exactly would amount to an enchantment that hurts game balance in your setting.",
