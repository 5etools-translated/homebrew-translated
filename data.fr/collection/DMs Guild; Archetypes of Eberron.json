Despite the best efforts by the Inspired to restrict the knowledge of crystal shaping, teaching it only to trusted Chosen artisans, the kalashtar of Adar developed similar practices with a healthier respect for the artificer's own mind. Adaran refugees eventually introduced the practice to Khorvaire, though it remains little more than an academic curiosity outside kalashtar communities such as Overlook in Sharn.",
