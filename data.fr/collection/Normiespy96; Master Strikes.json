						"Over the ages legends have been told of great warriors, those whose tales of battle and feats of martial prowess were something very few are able to achieve. To these heroes and villains of legends, their weapons were mere extension of their martial might.

You can only flavor how you swing your longsword so many times.",
										"Second is for balance reasons. It's nothing new that martial classes fall down in later levels. Once level 5 spells are on the table it becomes apparent. On level 11 casters are altering reality while martial classes struggle to keep up.",
										"Last is to give players a sense of how much they have grown over the story. Casters get a great sense of this with spells, a first level wizard can't cast a Fireball. But a level 1 fighter can hit with a sword, something a level 14 fighter will be doing on almost every turn. Thus, Master Strikes let players feel like they get to do something they just couldn't before."
