						"L'installation ou la dépose des modules ne peut se faire que dans un atelier. L'installation d'un module prend une heure. Des ateliers sont disponibles dans la plupart des grandes villes. Les ateliers privés peuvent être construits par des créatures pour 20 000 gp ou loués pour un prix négocié, généralement 25 gp par semaine de travail. Faire des réparations dans un atelier réduit le temps passé en fonction de la qualité de l'atelier. Les ateliers médiocres offrent un espace suffisant pour travailler. Les ateliers de qualité moyenne offrent un espace de travail adéquat et réduisent de 25 % le prix de la réparation d'un module. Les ateliers bien établis offrent un espace de travail suffisant et réduisent de moitié le prix de la réparation de tous les modules. Les ateliers bien établis offrent un espace de travail suffisant et réduisent de trois quarts le prix de la réparation des modules. La différence de prix est due aux outils et aux installations disponibles dans l'atelier."

For each day spent in contact with an infected creature, a humanoid creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or catch the disease.

The disease causes sore skin as patches of pale scaly bumps appear across the body. If the disease is not cured, these lumps eventually spread cover the entire body. The disease causes numbness in the extremities, making delicate manipulation tricky and leading to repeated injuries that often become infected with other diseases. The infected creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws related to diseases as well as on checks requiring finesse, such as Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or treating injuries with Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}).",

On a roll of 90 or less, the spell succeeds in erasing the non-magical writing despite someone holding the source of the writing.",

The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the script or spell is erased. If you fail to erase glyphs of warding, arcane runes or the like, you accidentally activate it instead."
