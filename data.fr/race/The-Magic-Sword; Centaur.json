In either case, centaur hold loyalty to the community as high in their esteem and will certainly fight to preserve the safety of their herd, whether that herd is the tribe, the village, or a company of adventurers.",

Amidst the weapons used by centaur warriors, hafted weapons like spears and axes are particularly beloved.
