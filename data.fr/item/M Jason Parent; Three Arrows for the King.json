				"These arrows are very front-heavy because of the onepound ceramic container mounted at the end of the shaft, replacing the head of the arrow. These arrows can hold any alchemical substance from the core rules, such as alchemist's fire or acid. These arrows only require a touch attack to hit, but deal no damage. Instead they deliver the alchemical weapon to the target struck. Alchemist's arrows are destroyed when used and they cannot be recovered whether they hit or miss. In addition, they are quite fragile, and have been known to break when dropped, when the bearer is grappled or falls from a height, etc.",

In addition, upon close inspection, one can see a very fine crack along the shaft, up and through the head. When fired, the shaft separates into two parts, connected by a thin metal wire. On a successful hit, the two halves pass by the target on either side, letting the target be hit by the wire.",

Instead of a pointed head, the tip of the arrow consists of a tightly bound pouch. When it impacts, the pouch ruptures, releasing a roiling green cloud that envelops a 5 ft. radius around the point of contact.... All targets within the area of effect must make a Constitution save (DC 12), or become {@condition Poisoned}, once the creature exits the cloud, at the beginning of its round the creature gets a save  to remove the condition.

				"Used primarily for signalling during a battle or as a warning by a sentry, whistling arrows are occasionally used to deliver a warning or on arrows that carry a note, making the arrow easier to find once fired. Whistling arrows create a very high-pitched sound when fired that is easily heard by anyone within 50 feet of the flight path of the arrow. Anyone within 300 feet of the flight of the arrow will hear it with a DC 10 perception check. Whistling arrows deal damage two dice smaller than a typical arrow in the style of bow used to fire it, because they are much lighter, and the head of the arrow has the grooves that create the distinctive whistling sound."

				"These axes are the trademark of the tunnel fighting dwarves within those clans that have such trained shocktroops. Essentially a hefty double-headed axe, the Axebow also contains a heavy crossbow, built into the haft and head of the axe. By necessity, the limbs on the crossbow are shorter than those on a full heavy crossbow, and thus the weapon is for most intents treated as a light crossbow. The design of the axebow does not allow for easy reloading in combat, and generally it is fired immediately at the beginning of an encounter and only reloaded when the battle is over. Reloading an axebow takes two actions"
