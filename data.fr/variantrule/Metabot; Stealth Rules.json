						"A good stealth mission starts with the players entering from a direction orthogonal to where enemies expect them to come in. Thus the first areas are less well patrolled and the likelyhood of success is high.",

These stealth rules work best when the map has clusters of open-ish areas that are cut off from other areas. This prevents a botched attempt at stealth from spilling over into the rest of the battle map."

						"As an aside: some magics, most notably pass without a trace, can trivialize stealth-focused missions. How you deal with it is up to you, but try to find ways to notify your players of the fabricated drawbacks as well as to give them some bonus."
