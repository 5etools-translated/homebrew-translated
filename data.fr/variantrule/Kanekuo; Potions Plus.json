Some poisons have a very low detection DC, as they're not meant to be delivered stealthily, others have a very high DC, making them perfect for subtle operations.",
						"Like most of the ingredients that you'll read about later, some bases can only hold their form when mixed with the right ingredients. This means that for a powder base to hold it's \"powderiness\", it needs to be mixed with other powders, or else the poison becomes a paste, which while not inherently a bad thing, may not be what you're looking for. More on this later.",

It also dictates the duration that the creature will be poisoned for.",
