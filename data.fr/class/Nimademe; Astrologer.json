Even with the fast casting time, astrologers in the past were vulnerable when they performed a cosmic ritual because they couldn't defend themselves as they performed it. This was solved by taking a portion of the magic used to perform the ritual and converting it into light, specifically sunlight, moonlight, and starlight.
