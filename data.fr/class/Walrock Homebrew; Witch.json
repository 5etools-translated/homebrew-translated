						"Holding a wand in a loose grip, a young human with tousled red hair and a sheepish grin faces down a furious orc warrior nearly three times his size. With a word and a gesture, the boy's red hair suddenly erupts into a flurry of long, vicious, living tendrils that wrap themselves around the legs and throat of the orc, dragging the shocked warrior off his feet and holding him aloft.",
						"Sitting atop a floating broom, a wood elf with glowing green eyes gently directs it to pass by the royal palace and idle next to an open window overlooking the throne room. She spies, through the window, the king of all the realm holding court on his throne. The elf gingerly reaches into her sleeve and retrieves a rudimentary straw doll, fashioned with a tiny gold crown upon its head, and a gleaming silver pin. A single pinprick strikes through the heart of the doll, and the king doubles over clutching his chest in pain, sending his courtiers into a blind panic. The wood elf watches, satisfied.",
						"Pounding a handful of herbs into powder with her trusty mortar and pestle, an elderly tiefling in a flowing grey robe tosses them into her cauldron, already raised to a boil over an open flame. As she does so, the cauldron exudes a noxious green cloud and begins to froth wildly. In just a handful of days, the tiefling will begin the distillation process, creating a new vial of eldritch poison to seep life from the world.",
						"Witches are learned practitioners of the earliest of magics, from a time when the arcane and the natural were studied as one. Eschewing the more esoteric magics studied by some of their peers, witches prefer practical magic with a variety of potential uses. Witches draw upon the power inherent in the night and the land to breathe life into fallen comrades, brew mystical potions and poisons mighty enough to fell a dragon, and weave terrible curses that may plague an individual for the rest of their life.",
						{
							"name": "Acolytes of the First Magic",
							"entries": [
								"When the world was young and the mortal races existed entirely at the mercy of primordials, gods, and monsters, there were beings in the darkness that took a surprising mercy on those lesser creatures struggling to survive.",
								"Whether these beings were spirits, specific gods, or something more sinister, no two tales agree, but the bargains they struck ushered the first inklings of mortal magic into the world. Witches hold as tradition that it was these magics that gave mortals a fighting chance, while others more suspicious of witchcraft tell that this was the first interference of malicious entities into mortal affairs, and an affront to the pure will of the gods.",
								"Witches are always deeply individualistic, and in the present era have been divided by coven and practice. Though all witches learn from the writings of and words spoken by their elders, some study the ancient ways as an evolving historical and scholastic pursuit, while others practice their magics wild and with full communion of the old beings who laid the path of natural arcana before them. An endlessly diverse group of practitioners, witches rarely agree how best to use their magic, even within the same coven."

						{

								"Though not all witches wander far and wide, no witch lives what could be considered a normal life. The reputation of witches as curse-binders and worse often precedes them, and even the best of witches often face at least an inkling of suspicion or fear from those they attempt to help.",
								"Nevertheless, witches are always dedicated to learning the intricacies of their craft, though many witches do dabble. The specifics of the craft a witch learns are usually the product of the life that witch has led. A witch that knows how to bind wounds has likely done so on many occasions, while a witch skilled in the arts of cursing may have lived a life full of revenge and spite."

								"When you create your witch character, consider strongly their morals and personal leanings. Witches always hold opinions of the world that they are willing to act upon, making them a dynamic and decisive force. How do these attitudes shape your magic, and how has your magic shaped them, in turn?",
								"Who was the witch that introduced you to magic? Did you stumble upon an occult ritual deep in the woods, or did you enroll in a prestigious institute of witchcraft? What values do those witches close to you hold, and how have they colored your personality and ideals?",
								"Finally, what has made you choose the life of a wandering witch? Are you searching for untold secrets, running from your status as a pariah, or seeking a land and place to call your own? In any case, your motivations are your own, and very little will stop you from achieving them.",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"name": "Witchcraft and Gender",
									"entries": [
										"In many worlds, witchcraft as a magical practice is closely aligned with magic users that identify as female. For whatever reason, the magics that the witches of these worlds practice are primarily (or exclusively) the domain of a single gender.",
										"However, the witch as presented historically in D&D does not by default align with one gender or another. Members of any gender identification can be a witch, though cultural and social mores around gender and witchcraft likely still vary dramatically from setting to setting."

A creature cannot have its fortune read by this ritual more than once every 30 days.",

Once the creature has selected a card, however, it knows fully the effects of the card chosen.",

If it is impossible to draw three cards without turning up one which the creature has already selected, this ritual no longer works for that creature.",
