						"Peals of thunder and sheets of rainfall batter a lone traveler on a forest road. In a flash of lightning, a half-dozen hooded bandits emerge from the treeline, brandishing crossbows and shouting demands. Weary but unfazed, the traveler draws a longsword and plunges into an exotic stance, sweeping through the brigands with terrible speed.",
						"On another road, caustic bile drips from a behir's teeth as it surveys its latest victim\u2014its next meal. The elf adorned in patchwork armor, beaten and bruised, snaps awake and seizes a cracked floor tile with both hands. Wild desperation in her eyes, the elf drives the tile into the behir's skull over and over, carving a path towardsalvation.",
						"No matter where they're going or what they're running from, a vagabond's only home is the open road. The peril of their journey would leave most dead on the roadside, but the vagabond endures, driven by a desperate will to survive and a mastery of fierce combat maneuvers.",

Some choose the unrooted lifestyle, but many more were driven from their homes, never to return. Whether a particular vagabond is a dangerous fugitive, penniless vagrant, or devout pilgrim is a secret known only to them. After all, anonymity is a precious boon for the road-weary.",

When a vagabond is backed into a corner, they fight like a crazed animal, slashing wildly, biting and scratching if necessary. But they also learn more practical tools for survival.",

								"As you create your vagabond, consider why your character has taken to the road. Do you one day wish to return home? Consult the options in the {@classFeature Wanderer's Secret|Vagabond|MHP:VB|1} feature for ideas. Also consider how your journey has shaped your character so far. Do you take joy in finding companionship wherever you travel, or do you prefer anonymity underneath a drawn hood? Are you roadweary from your travels or does seeing a new horizon invigorate you each day?",
								"Who taught you how to wield a weapon, and who trained you in the deeper arts of battle tactics? You might be self-trained, learning through near-death experiences and careful observation of others. Or you might have had a tutor, even several of them, whose teachings have resulted in your unique fighting style. Were you a dangerous combatant before you left home, or are your fearsome maneuvers a survival mechanism learned on the road?",

										"You can make a vagabond quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on a combination of archery and finesse weapons. Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Charisma if you plan to take a subclass, such as Mage Brand, that employs spellcasting or other magical abilities. Finally, choose any background, preferably one that ties into your choice for your Wanderer's Secret feature."
