						"As the aging man struggled to keep up with his companions, he started to regret his decision to join the young adventurers. His days of glory had long passed, but hearing the poorly devised plan of the aspiring heroes had rekindled something inside his soul that he thought gone forever. The old man couldn't use a sword like he used to, but if his young companions took his advice, they may yet be able to survive the dangerous life an adventure for a few days.",
						"A graying dwarf surveyed the enemy camp as the sun began to set. Along with three of her best soldiers, she had made her way to the enemy general's tent with the intent to rout the army or die in the attempt. In a fully pitched battle, the small band of dwarves under her command wouldn't stand a chance against this great host. However, if her group of elite soldiers followed her orders to the letter, they had a chance to cut off the head of the army before it came to battle. For what could be her final mission, she gripped her battleaxe and gave the order to move out.",
						"The dwarven lord ordered his soldiers to form ranks as the uncountable horde of horrors poured forth from the tunnel ahead. He positioned his platoon of elite warriors in the final tunnel before the entrance of his clan's great city. His clan had delved too greedily and they had freed something from the depths below. The lord muttered a final prayer and prepared to lead his men to their deaths, hopefully giving the rest of his clan time to escape the unstoppable horde of monstrosities.",
						"The flamboyant elven gladiator paused for a brief moment, basking in the cheers of the crowd. He remembered his first gladiatorial match in the underground arena, surrounded by drunken pirates and slavers. Now he performed for the king and queen amidst the bustle of the largest metropolis in the kingdom. After savoring the moment, he whirled about and plunged his gilded spear into his opponent's heart, ending what would be his final fight and earning him his freedom.",
						"A lithe wood elf quietly led her hunting party through the underbrush of the great wood. They had tracked their foe, a great two-headed troll, for almost two days. As it rested in a clearing, she gave the signal and her fellow hunters fanned out around the beast, blending in with the natural landscape. On her mark, the hunting party lunged forward with their spears, and the troll was felled before it could react.",
