Enforcers of Dis are, without a doubt, cruel, but they are not capricious. Like their lord, they place value in the law. Enforcers can mete out punishment on the spot for transgressions, and, this being Hell, punishment is swift and severe. The most common penalty is death, followed by imprisonment and torture. Several neighborhoods of Dis host mortal residents, an oddity in Hell. Some residents were lured here by infernal lies, others came with adventuring parties and were stranded, and a few even thought they could profit in Hell. The enforcers of Dis pay particular attention to these districts, most of whose residents live in abject fear of them. One word from an enforcer can send anyone to prison\u2014or worse."

At the end of the frightened creature's turn, it can repeat the saving throw and ends the frightened condition on itself with a successful save. • Excrement-slicked hands emerge from the surface inside a 30-foot radius around the dragon to grab anything they can reach. Each creature on the ground in the area other than the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. A creature restrained in this way can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and removes the restrained condition from itself on a success. ",
					"Regional Effects An Abyssal dragon's lair pollutes the region around it, creating one or more of the following effects: • The faces of souls the Abyssal dragon has devoured appear on surfaces within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. Animate but silent, the faces mouth curses, laughter, mockeries, and wails at passersby. • Waters redolent of blood, excrement, and worse collect in pits and gullies within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. Aside from the noxious stench, the liquid is toxic, and a creature that comes into contact with the liquid must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain 2 levels of exhaustion and become poisoned for 24 hours. • Hoots, cries, wails, laughter, and other unnerving noises sound at random intervals within 1 mile of the lair. If the Abyssal dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d12 days."

Mortal scholars have noted a certain similarity to the couatl, and conjecture makes asakkus ancient, evil offshoots of those feathery exemplars of virtue. If this is true, neither asakkus nor couatls have confirmed it. However, there are several battles documented between the two, most of which have been noted for their intense savagery. It isn't clear whether these battles signify nothing more than the animosity of good and evil or the special hatred only estranged family members know. In any case, fighting is not the primary responsibility of asakkus. They perform very special duties for Lilith: the corruption and infection of mortal children. They are frequent callers on the Material Plane, commonly visiting rural areas. Polymorphed into wide-eyed youths or fantastical animals like unicorns, asakkus befriend children while their parents toil in the field or the home. Asakkus seem like friendly faeries, full of stories and magic. Those children befriended by asakkus meet one of three fates. The asakkus drink their blood, infect them with lethal diseases, or corrupt their young souls. The latter is the most difficult to achieve but pleases the asakkus the most. When a child plunges a knife into their father's heart of their own free will, the asakku knows it has served its mistress well. Children who are good at heart are more likely to simply be killed. These deaths, especially those brought about by disease, are designed to bring despair to the parents of the slain."

					"Bulugons are common in the Third Circle of Hell. Their appetite is legendary: bulugons are perhaps Hell's greatest gluttons. Food is scarce on the Third Circle, but they are canny scavengers. Their bloated forms slide easily through the mud and slime, and they can hunt in the icy depths with relative ease. Their corpulent bodies make them clumsy fliers, but amazingly their wings can support their bulk. With its wide jaws and large size, a bulugon can swallow a humansized being whole, stripping the flesh from the bones and spitting out the remains. Bulugons are typically summoned to the Material Plane as tools of vengeance (either at the behest of their own lords or by evil spellcasters). Necromancers have been known to consort with bulugons because they can provide clean skeletons in just a few minutes.",
					"Infernal Gorgers",

It then sets itself up in a convenient location, like a cave or, more blasphemously, a religious shrine. Word goes out through the charmed dupes that the devil must be fed or the community will feel its wrath. The bulugon keeps eating no matter how much food comes in tribute. In just a few days, it can deplete the food reserves of the average village. Some bulugons don't stop even after the food stock is gone. These malefic gluttons turn on the locals and start to feed on them. There are many tales of the heinous lotteries enacted by small communities as the locals tried to choose the next victim of the bulugon's insatiable appetite. Bulugons have been the cause of countless famines, but they usually return to Hell before vengeful clerics or adventurers can make them pay for their crimes.",
					"Reluctant Servants",
					"Sadly for bulugons, their lives do not consist solely of living off the fat of others. They must sometimes fight for their masters or defend themselves from adventurers. They prefer to fight on the ground but are adept at using their horns in aerial combat. Bulugons may not be very fast or agile, but their considerable bulk adds to the punch when they impact. In the perpetual rain of the Third Circle, enemies rarely see them coming. Bulugons usually fight defensively."

Hellwardens look like horribly crucified devils, often with missing limbs and gaping wounds. Although they appear quite dead, powerful magic keeps them alive. Baal and his commanders plant these spies throughout the First Circle to collect intelligence on their enemies. Hellwardens are sometimes used to guard fortresses and encampments as well, since their piercing scream makes an excellent alarm. Hellwardens are occasionally seen on the Material Plane, but only during particularly brutal wars or pogroms",

This is more difficult than it sounds, because spinders cannot gestate on their own but must infest other creatures by force. Because they aren't much of a threat singly, spinders band together in groups of six or more to better accomplish this goal. The other denizens of Hell react poorly to spinders and attempt to exterminate any packs they find in their vicinity. This prejudice has made the spinders nomadic out of necessity. Similarly, they can survive for years without food, although they tend to eat in prodigious amounts if they have not fed for any substantial period of time.",

Upon finding a suitable target, a group of spinders attempts to encircle its prey. They run forward on all fours with their heads down, relying on their spines to deflect any potential ranged attacks. Once they have their prey surrounded (or as close to this as they can get), they leap simultaneously, trying to knock the target down. If the spinders do not have the advantage of numbers, they leave one or more enemies free so that they can gang up on others. Spinders press their attack until they have killed or subdued their foes, unless there is danger of the entire pack being wiped out, in which case they beat a hasty retreat. If they have managed to infest one or more opponents, they break off at the first sign that the combat is going against them."

They serve in the infernal courts as jesters and whipping boys, a ready form of entertainment for the jaded aristocracy of Hell. Over the centuries, the vierhaanders have lost most of their ability to speak, but they have gained something else: the desire for freedom. There are numerous barriers to this recently discovered need, not the least of which is the fact that their numbers are scattered throughout Hell. Since their tasks only take up a small fraction of their day, however, the vierhaanders have been slowly building up an underground network through which they can communicate. They know that they cannot hope to escape from their servitude by force, so a subtler way of attaining their goal is currently in discussion. Adventurers who are foolish enough to believe they can gain allies by advancing this cause, though, are likely to live only long enough to regret their error. Vierhaanders are seldom seen on the Material Plane. They are a valued commodity and are only given (or, more often the case, loaned) to mortals who have committed truly nefarious deeds in service to Hell. A vierhaander uses such an opportunity to its advantage, trying either to escape or to kill its mortal master. If successful, it stays clear of mortal settlements and sticks to secluded wilderness areas where it is unlikely to be noticed"

According to the laws of planar philosophy, they should not exist: celestials are made of the essence of goodness. Yet a very, very few do become corrupted by evil.

					"Though all fallen celestials willfully turned from the cause of good, not all expected to be thrown down for their transgressions. Some, even after centuries, cannot believe what has happened to them and continue, as much as they are able, to live righteous lives. More often, fallen celestials remain deeply embittered about their outcast status, working to make a mockery of everything they once held sacred. Few enemies of the Lords of Good are as spiteful as the Fallen.",
					"Unholy compact",
					"Some powerful fallen angels can engage a living creature in a blasphemous agreement. The Fallen offers the realization of a great temptation in exchange for the mortal's soul upon that being's death. When a mortal who has consented to the unholy compact dies, their soul travels to the Fallen's domain in the Lower Planes. There it is permanently trapped, as though with the minimus containment effect of the imprisonment spell. The terms of the compact must be absolutely clear, and the mortal cannot be under any form of magical compulsion, lest the agreement be considered null and void. Acceptance need be no more than a verbal statement that is a free action. Some fallen celestials prefer to draw up a physical contract, but this is an affectation. As soon as the agreement is in place, the Fallen must spend its next action casting the wish spell, which it can only do when a compact is made. Freeing oneself from an unholy compact is nearly impossible. Even a wish spell cannot release the promised soul. A still-living mortal is released only if the Fallen is destroyed or the mortal can somehow convince it to give up its claim without magical compulsion. A fallen angel automatically knows if a given mortal has entered into a compact with another and has little patience with those it knows it cannot corrupt.",
					"Holy interdict",
					"As a consequence of their disgrace, the Fallen are forever barred from venturing to the Upper Planes, whether by magical or nonmagical means. Likewise, they have difficulty entering holy places, such as churches and even graveyards dedicated to the Lords of Good. In order to do so, the fallen celestial must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw. The DC might be higher for especially sanctified places, such as the main temple of the pantheon's chief deity.",

And in the carnal act of their passion, hideous worms spilled from her belly and devoured him, manhood first, until nothing remained of him but bones. With his bargain fulfilled, Mephistopheles claimed the woman and dragged her to Hell to suffer her reward, and from her tormented womb slithered free these abominations."

					"Sphinxes normally see themselves above the fray when it comes to the struggle between light and dark, good and evil. However, sometimes a sphinx gains Hell's attention and might find itself drawn into darkness against its will. 0Darksphinxes are raised in Hell and learn at Hadriel's feet, trained as bodyguards and instilled with utter loyalty to the duchess. Hadriel awards them to her most trusted lieutenants and occasionally to other devil nobles as well. A darksphinx bodyguard is very prestigious and highly sought after in Hell. Many suspect that these \"bodyguards\" are nothing more than spies for Hadriel, but that has never been proven. Although their job may seem simple, the darksphinxes enjoy their work. Protecting an important personage from assassination in Hell is a never-ending intellectual sport, and second-guessing creatures bred to be deceptive is no easy task. The appearance of darksphinxes makes their lineage clear, but they stand upright like humanoids and prefer to use weapons in combat.",

When she became the Duchess of Domination, Hadriel sought out several gynosphinxes and tried to attract them to her entourage, without success. The creatures would not be wooed by power or prestige. Hadriel decided to approach the problem differently. She visited a powerful gynosphinx named Newella and challenged her to a battle of wits. If Newella won, Hadriel would become her servant. If Hadriel won, Newella would mate with the male of Hadriel's choosing. The contestants posed a dozen riddles and logic puzzles to each other. Newella missed but a single answer, but that was enough. She was forced to mate with Hadriel's husband, Duke Bifrons. The resulting half-fiend offspring were the first darksphinxes."

The remaining hydraggons fled into the depths of the river. Since the Styx is incalculably long, the hydraggons split up and hid in stretches of the river throughout the Lower Planes. The celestial armies dared not follow them to Hell and Hades, lest they touch off a war even they could not win. Thousands of hydraggons were killed by devils, daemons, and other horrors of the Styx, but a core survived and even came to thrive in their adversity. Now hydraggons can be found throughout the River Styx. Although they are clearly of fiendish origin, few know they are from the Abyss. It is rumored that a colony of hydraggons also escaped to the Material Plane, but if this is so, their lair remains well hidden. Hydraggons do not usually congregate in large numbers, since they've found it easier to pass unnoticed in small groups. In dire situations, though, it can be critical for all hydraggons in the area to coalesce quickly. The hydraggons developed their natural telepathic abilities, so now each can create a psychic homing beacon to make the most of their limited numbers."

					"Balan, a three-headed beast of a devil, is a noble in the service of Belial, Lord of the Fourth Circle. As Master of the Infernal Hunt, Balan organizes hunts for Belial's sport on the Fourth Circle. These inevitably revolve around stalking and killing rogue devils or bands of invaders. The noted paladin Flavius was caught in one such hunt, and he and his followers were slain to a man. Belial also periodically releases Balan and his Infernal Hunt onto the Material Plane. This is a real treat for the old devil. He gathers together a pack of fiendish beasts, hell hounds, and devils. They appear at night, howling through the sky and landing to reap souls and cause untold destruction. Each hunt has a special target chosen by Belial (such as a troublesome crusading church), but the Master of the Infernal Hunt has free rein to continue his merry ride until he's had his fill of bloodletting. Balan and Mammon, Lord of the Third Circle, are great rivals as sportsmen. Mammon leads his own hunt, and devils can only speculate what would happen if the two were ever to meet.",
					"The infernal hunt",
					"Balan is usually encountered with his hunt, which ranges in size from a dozen creatures to over a hundred. A typical hunt includes his hunter Beldrake and 3d6 hell hounds. The hunt uses its great numbers and speed to run enemies to ground and tear them apart."

					"Before the angelic rebellion in heaven\u2014before the fall of those angels and their subsequent descent to the Abyss and Hell\u2014there was Ahrimanes. An angel, like so many of his brethren that fell from grace, he never exhibited the purity of his fellow celestials. Despite dwelling in the presence of the gods, he could never accept that these beings could have created him. He watched their bickering and childish behavior in shock, horrified by the power they controlled and disgusted by their capriciousness and infighting. He grew to hate them, and, in his hate, he fomented discord in his kind, forming the first rebellion against the gods. His arrogance allowed him to believe he could walk unchallenged in Heaven, talking freely of the pettiness of the immortal masters and their misguided use of power. He gathered a motley host of sycophants to his side, composed of those who saw things as he did, or perhaps they joined because they saw power in him. When their meetings turned violent, the gods would brook no more offense and demanded that Ahrimanes and his followers be cast out of the Heavens. Those angels who enforced the gods' will were Iblis, Sariel, and Beelzebub, who would eventually rise up against their divine masters when the gods created mortals, inspired by the words of Ahrimanes. Ahrimanes's ejection from the Heavens occurred before Hell was formed and while the qlippoth still ruled unchallenged in the dark, away from the gods. No mortal world yet existed, so Ahrimanes wandered the shadows of the cosmos, too afraid to find shelter with the soulless in the yawning depths of the Abyss. Filled with hatred for all of his kind, he nursed his grief and loneliness for a thousand years, until mortal man first drew his breath on a world created just for him. Soon after, Ahrimanes watched his fellow angels\u2014those that ignored his warnings and cast him from the light of the Heavens\u2014struggle futilely against the combined might of the Heavens. He watched as Asmodeus, his heir, fell from the Heavens to land in a new place, a place of torment and woe, where the gods would give over mortals of similar disposition to the hateful devils. He laughed gleefully when the others fell to the Abyss and struggled for survival against the qlippoth. In the end, with these fiendish realms created and with demons and devils established in their new realms, Ahrimanes returned from his exile and settled in Gehenna, doing his part to corrupt the mortals and send them to their dark masters. He has an uneasy truce with the exarchs, though each suspects he plots to seize the entire plane for his own. Given his charismatic nature and bottomless corruption, it is a threat that all would do well not to ignore."

The target must then succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition stunned} for {@dice 2d4} rounds. A target {@condition stunned} in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that has lost its soul in this way and dies cannot be restored to life by any means short of a {@spell wish} spell.",
						"A jahi can hold a single soul at any one time. Once it has done so, it becomes significantly more difficult for it to operate in normal society. As the soul struggles fruitlessly to escape, it reaches for freedom so that impressions of its hands and face sometimes appear upon the jahi's belly. A jahi can disgorge the soul from its body as an action. Doing so returns the soul to its rightful place after {@dice 2d4} rounds (no matter the distance between body and soul).",
						"Those demon princes who employ jahi as kidnappers generally have some means of trapping captured souls in small cages or gems so that they might bargain with the mortals for services. Though they could doubtless destroy the captured souls, they gain no sustenance from doing so as they do from the annihilated souls of the chaotic evil dead. Creatures that lack souls, naturally, are immune to a jahi's Swallow Soul attack."
