				"In order for the gauntlet to function it requires all 4 rings of elemental command to be attached. The gauntlet easily seperates its forward fingers to allow slotting of said rings. The gauntlet is meant for the right hand.",
				"When attuned to the gauntlet, you naturally benefit from all languages given by the rings. In addition, you must use both your action and your bonus action to switch selection between rings. A selected ring in the gauntlet allows you to benefit from all its powers as defined in their respective descriptions. Charges needed by the ring are pulled from the gauntlet. The gauntlet has 20 charges and regains all of them at dawn.",
				"As a reaction, you may switch your current selection of a ring to another, this option costs 5 charges from the gauntlet."
