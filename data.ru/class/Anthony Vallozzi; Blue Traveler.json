Special action refers to any action, reaction, bonus action, or legendary action that the blue traveler is capable of learning.

For instance, when a creature attempts to use a learnable action, the DM can simply announce, \"The dragon uses its special: action, reaction, legendary action, etc, to use fire breath.\" So without needing to ask, the blue traveler will know if he can learn the action or not."

Blue travelers can learn spells of a higher level than they can cast, but they won't be useable until they can cast spells of that level, however they cannot learn spells that require a ritual as they cannot cast rituals. Learned legendary actions are used by spending a normal action, no matter what the cost of using it was to the original creature.",

(In very niche situations where an special action would seem weak without making multiple attacks, your DM may rule otherwise.)",
