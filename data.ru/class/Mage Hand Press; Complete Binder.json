But the most prominent voice was gruff and confident, which he used to lull his targets into complacency seconds before he struck with a hidden dagger. By the next morning, the gruff, independent voice was gone, instead replaced with a profound melancholy. He discarded the daggers too, in favor of a sturdy spear and imposing armor. The day after that, he struck an air of erratic rage, and he abandoned weapons altogether in favor of eldritch flame. Each morning, he woke up new, possessed by some new infernal spirit, dead god, or forgotten sinner.",
