While on the target's skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target's skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing 1 piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of {@dice 10d6}).

				"You imbue a weapon you touch with unholy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon shimmers with a dark, pulsating purplish aura. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra {@damage 2d8} necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration. As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage, and gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage."

				"A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-10-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.",
				"If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.",
				"If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.",
				"The wall is an object made of iron that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 18 and 60 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.",
				"Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena."
