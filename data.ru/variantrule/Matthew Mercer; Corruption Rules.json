						"Certain landscapes house deeply evil places or artifacts that corrupt the very nature of people who spend time around them. Sites where the presence of such terrible wickedness can slowly twist and infect the physical forms of even the most holy of creatures. Unhallowed or cursed locations that erode the drive and will of those that linger. When sleep comes to those that stay, it's this period of vulnerability that invites the darkness in. This ruleset, heavily inspired by and condensing many elements of the {@link Heroes of Horror|https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes_of_Horror} Taint rules, allows you to have this dark influence slowly infect your adventuring party, helping build tension as they traverse the shadowed lands.",
						"If a character completes a long rest near a source of strong, unholy evil or deeply corrupt magic, they must roll a Wisdom saving throw. The DC of the saving throw is outlined below, and is dependent on the character's current Corruption level and proximity to the source of evil. On a failure, the character suffers 1 point of Corruption.",
						"When a new tier or corruption is achieved (Mild to Moderate, Moderate to Severe), roll a {@dice d8} on the Corruption Effects table below to determine the effect of that character's corruption. Corruption effects are cumulative with previous effects as higher tiers are achieved. Effects fade when enough corruption points have been cured to lower the character's tier of corruption (Moderate to Mild, Mild to None). If a character reaches 12 or more Corruption points, the DM decides whether or not the character dies instantly, or goes insane and becomes an NPC under their control. A character with 12 or more corruption points cannot be brought back to life or restored to player control until they are brought below 12 corruption points.",
						"Corruption can only be cured naturally by resting away from any source of corruption, at a rate of 1 corruption point per week of rest. Otherwise, a {@spell Lesser Restoration} spell can cure 1 corruption point, and a {@spell Greater Restoration} spell can cure {@dice 1d4} corruption points.",
