						"Tatto magic is a rare form of magic that allows a spellcaster to imbue tattoo ink with magical energy. This ink may thne be used to create a tattoo on a target, whcih may be enchanted with a spell like any other magical item. The target gains the ability to activate the tattoo and benefit from the spell's effects.",
						"Tattoo magic is not without its drawbacks; unlike normal magic items, the spell in question is not enchanting an object, but rather a person. While living beings may normally be affected by spells with no lasting ill effects, they typically do not have to store the energy powering those spells for extended periods of time. Bearers of tattos, however, must become the conduits for the powers they channel. As a result, each tattoo converys unique side effects that mirror the magic it channels.",
						"The number and type of magical tattoos a character may possess is determined by his Constitution modifier. The character may wear a total number of ranks of tattoos equal to his Constitution modifier x2, and no character recieve a tattoo whcih has a prerequisite spell with a spell level higher than the character's Constitution modifier. For example, a character with Con 16 may receive a maximum of six ranks of tattoos, and no tattoo he receives may have a prerequisite spell higher than 3rd level. Characters who suffer Constitution damage or have their Constitution permanently lowered to the point they can no longer support the power of their tattoos will find their highest tattoo rank magical tattoo becomes dormant and unusable (and likewise further tattoos in order from highest to lowest until the character falls under the Constitution limits for tattoo use). If the character's Constitution is restored or even temporarily increased to a level that allows use of the dormant tattoo, it will begin functioning normally as long as the character's Constitution remains high enough.",
						"Unless a tattoo description specifies otherwise, tattoos must be activated to be successfully used. The user must make a Wisdom check (DC 5 + level of major spell effect) to successfully unleash the power of the tattoo, and must make a similar check to successfully deactivet the tattoo, if applicable.",
						"Like other magical items, tattoos may not simply be bought in a marketplace; rather, they  must be inscribed by a spellcaster or artificer who knows the spell/spell-like ability and also meets the prerequisites for inscribing that particular tattoo. Even though tattoos do not require a verbal command word to activate, base prices for tattoos are normally calculated as command word activated, spell effect items. Further many tattoos have a limited usage per day/long rest, which may affect their base price. Since tattoos have their own space limitations, their base price is not affected by the \"No space limitation\" modifier. Also, the Game Master should make some allowance for the side effects of a tattoo by lower the base price commensurately with the difficulties that result from the side effects (if any).",
						"Removing tattoos once in place requires high magic, as the process is similar to disenchanting any other magical item. Spells such as {@spell } may remove the magic from a tattoo (but not the tattoo image itself), and thereby eliminate the disenchanting tattoo from the limits on the number of magical tattoos a character can possess. Nonmagical tattoos can be removed from a subject's skin with a {@spell regenerate} spell cast upon the inked area.",
