				"This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence (Data) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the Technology skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a datapad, an arcane terminal, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an interface rig is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence (Data) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device.",
				"Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called Hacking and requires the use of an {@item interface rig|darkmatter}, as well as an Intelligence (Data) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's datapad to give you access to their information or bank account."

An exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures and contact émigré communities while rallying support remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.",

						"As a general rule, magic doesn't exist in science fiction.

						"In other words, magical things can always be dismissed with science.",
						"When you dive into the universe of Dark Matter, you'll find that quite the inverse is true: magic has become so advanced that it seems like high technology. Those blasters are highly-developed evocation wands, that flying car is using a permanent levitate spell, and traveling faster than the speed of light is simply an advanced application of teleportation magic.",
						"In Dark Matter, fantasy and science fiction can live side-by-side: the universe is filled to the brim with huge starships, innumerable alien creatures and planets, and all sorts of blasters, jetpacks, and power armor. It's also populated with dragons, demons, giants, and strange alien creatures to be met and slain. Axe-wielding barbarians clad in furs can stand alongside machine-gun toting androids, facing down alien horrors on the deck of a derelict space cruiser; trinket-festooned wizards and power armored space commandos can plot together to take down a dragon that lives in an asteroid made of solid gold; and lute-strumming bards can perform and garner fame in every hive of scum and villainy on the outer rim of the galaxy.",
						"At its core, Dark Matter is a love letter to our favorite science fiction franchises, and an acknowledgment that science fiction in general need not be divorced from fantasy. The best sci-fi, from Star Wars to Dune, is filled with fantastic elements: mystical space-wizards, laser swords, precognition, and unusual alien abilities, to name a few. None of them seem all that out of place in high fantasy, yet the two are irreparably divorced. Of course, the distinction is mostly an aesthetic one\u2014sci-fi outfits its magic in sleek metal, whereas high fantasy uses glowing arcane runes. Dark Matter is our attempt to bridge that gap.",
						"Somewhere out there in the Dark Matter universe, every conceivable world\u2014from the medieval domains of wizards and dragons to the high-tech alien planets of your favorite sci-fi franchise\u2014waits to be discovered. Your own campaign world is out there, too, perhaps blissfully unaware that alien starships dogfight high above, exchanging blaster fire for the fate of the galaxy.",

Moreover, one of the few things that might prompt an intervention from the bird-headed would be the death of a prisoner. She would have to tread lightly; loosing the full force of her power against this fool could spoil her eventual escape, or worse, cost her the map.",

										"A few seconds later, he was sprawled out on the canteen floor and the rest of his gang were preparing to pile in. Clearly the old man had never stopped making friends. Every lowlife in this place seemed to have his back. Rami dug through her memory for a spell which didn't require material components. Invisibility? No, that needs gum arabic. Silent image? Rami doubted her roughspun fatigues would count as fleece. Aha! Sleep might do the trick: Rami reached for a pinch of sand\u2014the Citadel's floor held no shortage of that\u2014and started forming somatic components.",
										"The faces of Rami's opponents exhibited a mixture of confusion and concern as she enchanted the sand, then a brief flash of horror as the bewitched grains flew towards the corners of their eyes. Within moments, a half-dozen of them had drifted off to sleep and collapsed in a pile. Rami sensed her opening.",
										"She darted forward, evading one thug and shoving another back with a gust of magical wind. One managed to hit her with a thrown boot, but the glancing blow didn't slow her dash toward the exit.",

Discovering the maws was a catalyst for the rapid expansion and colonization of the galaxy thousands of years ago, and their importance hasn't lessened since. Acting as a rapid transit network for ships, which can cross the galaxy in mere days, the maw stations connect the galactic empires, act as a neutral meeting ground for intrepid travelers, and form the cornerstone of galactic trade.

Demons and angels may be found sharing tables in taverns, chaos beasts can be found haggling with contract keepers from the Plane of Law over shipping manifests, and the bitterest of rival races may hammer out treaties between their peoples in the main courts. Maintaining this peace and neutrality are two unique groups: the amoeboids, a caretaker race of vaguely humanoid, translucent oozes native to the maws, and the Order of the Sepulcher, a relatively new organization of peacekeepers. Though the elves were the first humanoid race to discover and use the maws for their intended purpose, their creation and creator are shrouded in mystery. Only a few pieces of that mystery have been uncovered, the most prominent being the amoeboids themselves. Given that they are the only creatures native to the maws, they seem to be tasked with the continued upkeep and maintenance of the stations, and are especially apt to do so. However, the amoeboids' histories contain no record of their origins, or indeed, on the origins of the maws. Galactic Frontier. There is but one exception to the maw network's absolute connectivity: the links to the outermost ring of stations are one-way, allowing transit out to this outer-edge of the galaxy, but not back. Moreover, the outer ring itself enjoys only intermittent connectivity between stations, with an almost 25% chance for a failed jump between outer maws.

Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.",
										"Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cutting- edge intersection of science and arcana.",
										"Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply discovered on the maws.

After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giants, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.",
												"More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop colossal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable maw portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it's unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?",
												"For their part, the amoeboids have few answers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are as inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids, learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed \"zero\" generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.",
												"It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation."

This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.",

Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun's blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their deity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal.",
										"When the avia-ra took their first tentative steps into spaceflight, however, their religion bent and adapted to the wider universe in which they found themselves. Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical \"true star\" from which all stars, including their own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: the Sepulcher Star.",
										"In those days, the Sepulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitively under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to the elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.",

Each crusade was punctuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Sepulcher Star\u2014a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression.

After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitive civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets, with which to share their message.",
												"The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.",
												"This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing\u2014High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and condemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting galactic war.

What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy.

Within fifteen years, the Traversal Guild had managed to create a functioning, low-class Dark Matter engine powered by fuel sources known to them. Five years later, they perfected the new technology and achieved spaceflight. Within fifty years, the gnomes had breached the edges of the Zone, reached the maw nearest to Nebellion, and discovered their place in the 'verse. The whole of gnomish society refocused their efforts, and in another 50 years' time, the beginnings of the Great Gnomish Flotilla launched from the Nebellion shipyards, carrying seventy-five percent of their population with it."

The gnomes live in an essentially post- scarcity society, and most devote their time and energy to invention, exploration, artistic endeavors, or learning. Surprisingly few true adventurers come out of either the Flotilla or of Nebellion proper, as gnomes tend to be risk-averse if they can afford to be. Still, star gnomes are highly sought-after as ship's engineers, pilots, and technologists, and their tech is highly valued for its ability to function perfectly in Dead Magic Zones.",

The Council of Six rules as a democratically elected council comprised of members from each of the six guilds which have governed the planet's year-to-year workings for centuries: The Craftsman's Guild (Mechanical and Technological works), The Mason's Guild (Large Scale Construction works), the Baker's Guild (Agriculture and Sustainability works), The Traversal Guild (Exploration and Expansion projects), The Windmill Guild (Power Efficiency and Generation projects), and The Artisan's Guild (Cultural projects and Artworks). Conversely, the Admiralty is governed by the Flotilla's current Admiral and his subordinate officers. Each ship in the flotilla is like an independent state: free to do as its needs dictate, but still required to report to the Admiral when called.",

										"Founded nearly two millennia ago, Astrogations Inc. has grown to become the preeminent starfaring guild in the 'verse. Concerned chiefly with accurately charting every system in the galaxy, A.I. has brokered centuries- long contracts with all of the major players in the Black, granting them a near-monopoly over galactic cartography. Additionally, A.I. offers swift, discreet travel services between over three thousand different ports of call, including every maw on the grid. If you need to get somewhere or find something, no one in the 'verse is going to do it faster than Astrogations Inc.",
										"The greatest problem A.I. faces is that, unlike terrestrial cartography, the \"topology\" of the 'verse is in constant flux. While some points (such as the maw stations) rotate about the galactic core in relatively fixed positions, there are enough spatial anomalies, rogue planets, and gravitational channels to keep a dedicated mapmaker busy for several lifetimes; this doesn't even consider the trouble of keeping the galactic governmental demarcations accurate and true. Even small changes in gravitational pull on a trade route could send a freighter plunging into a star, so extremely accurate charts are imperative.",
										"To this end, A.I. deals in information of all kinds, purchasing star charts, planet scans, void jump data, and scans of anomalous events from explorers and spacers alike. This very information is cataloged and sold back to spacers to help refine navigation, dealt to the major galactic powers to define their borders, and used by spellcasters to accurately cast the astrogation spell, the company's namesake. Perfectly neutral in its dealings, A.I. will buy or sell from any willing customer, as long as doing so will turn a profit. The A.I. headquarters, located on Concordia, is said to possess hundreds of thousands of arcane terminals to store and collate its data.",
										"Of course, A.I. has one additional trick up its sleeve to stay ahead of the competition: along with employing thousands of star-cartographers and information brokers, A.I. is also rumored to employ a staff of psychics, soothsayers, and oracles who attempt to divine the future of galactic movements. Long ago, A.I cartographers realized that, while the predictions of one psychic might be unreliable, the average of a hundred or more can yield consistently true results, even out to years in the future. It is even possible that A.I.'s psychic think-tank has predicted more than just the future of galactic movements; that their psychics have divined great cataclysms that await the 'verse. Of course, if that were true, A.I. has remained silent on the matter, perhaps wishing to turn this information to profit in the future."

										"Across the 'verse, the Cabal is synonymous with devil- summoning and unholy bargains, but to say that they're evil would be an outright exaggeration. The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee's soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee's soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.",
										"This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn't require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.",
										"The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a high- ranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.",
										"The Cabal will hire anyone that passes the prerequisite legal and brokerage exams, but prefers tiefling employees for their natural silver tongues and infernal blood. Soul brokers can also be hired to oversee other legal matters, as most soul brokers become qualified lawyers before taking the brokerage exams."

Established five hundred years ago by a group of defected military leaders, the Coalition purportedly maintains a standing army of nearly a billion soldiers, with an armada to match. While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition's specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).",
										"The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier's basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal's word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.",
										"Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax's Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.",
										"Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition's greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle."

Finding that he couldn't obtain decent work on any planet he visited (at least, work that didn't involve clubbing someone in the knees), Grax moved to the outer ring, sold his ship, and set about establishing a company that would accept anyone as a patron or employee. Today, no other mercenary service in the 'verse is as widespread. While others may have nicer equipment, have better training, or fly around in nicer ships, none can match Grax's Guys for sheer numbers or tenacity; also, Grax serves the best beer.",
										"GGFC operates somewhat differently to most other mercenary companies. While they aren't averse to the usual bodyguard duty, security detail, or military backup that most mercs expect, prospective employers can ask almost anything of Grax's Guys: a given merc might take a job shipping Rosvalian star pigs across the galaxy, only to then act as a short order cook in the restaurant those pigs are served at. This wide net of job postings has been a cornerstone of Grax's success. Grax's Guys will take nearly any job, provided that it is both legal in most galactic territories and the pay is acceptable, with a half- up-front deposit. Their tagline \"You can trust Grax!\" can be seen advertised in almost every port in the 'verse.",
										"Since its inception, Grax has made a point to offer regular contracts to mercs from disenfranchised and distrusted races, particularly half-breeds. His experience attempting to find gainful employment after departing the Warzone keyed him in to the need for reliable and legal employment for the galaxy's outcasts.

										"And indeed it was, but once their Freelancer was clear of the station, they were away quickly, launching into a void jump moments after passing through the hangar doors. A blind jump, yes, but one Nano was familiar with. Besides, the Miaam-Osk Pathway had long been a favorite route for both smugglers and legitimate merchants, so even if the jump wasn't entirely accurate, there would be enough beacons, signals and landmark planetoids to get back on track.",
										"As the ship progressed through the void, Rami popped back to the bridge. \"If them Firm boys are anywhere, they'll be in the Whiteglass cluster at the far edge of the Miaam system. The asteroids there block all divination magic somehow. It's a good place to hide...\"",
										"\"...but it also means they won't be able to see us coming.\" Mekhet-Nu finished the thought.",
										"\"Excellent. Let's go steal us an arcane warhead.\"",
										"Sure enough, they touched down on one of the icy asteroids without any kind of interception. \"Are you sure they're here?\" asked Mekhet-Nu, while he nonetheless readied his sunstaff in a battle stance.",
										"\"You saw the junk drifting around up there. Someone's here, and if their lack of respect for interplanetary littering laws is anything to go by, I deduce they must be hardened criminals,\" whispered Nano, expression unreadable.",
										"\"Did\u2014did the vect just tell a joke?\" Rami gawked.",
										"Her bewilderment was interrupted by a flurry of blaster fire, which began to scythe through the party from an unseen pillbox, half buried in snow.",

										"Meanwhile, Nano triggered a gadget, deploying a large hemisphere of force around the three of them. \"Here, save your spells. I grabbed a carbine for you from the ship; it should be enough to hold them off while I get set up.\"",
										"\"Set up?\" Rami tried to ask, but another hail of fire came in, shattering the gadgeteer's temporary dome. Hitting the deck, she used a cantrip to raise a low wall out of ice. \"Blast it, Mek, get down!\"",
										"The avia-ra, several scorch marks already burned into his muscular chest, squawked as he fired his sunstaff into the attackers, but soon realized that Rami had a point. Against so many, defensive measures would be necessary.",
										"The two of them exchanged shots with the smugglers, pinning some of them down, but doing little to reduce their numerical advantage. Before long, Firm gunmen were moving into flanking positions, and one of their leaders shouted: \"I don't know who you are, but anyone who thinks they can barge onto our asteroid and get away alive can't be very smart! We'll be taking that ship, too!\"",
										"Just then, Nano stopped working on a turret-like device. \"Don't count your roaches before you've jumped, fleshbag!\" The device then began to glow.",
										"\"Is that... should we...?\" Rami stammered.",
										"\"Yes, we should probably get out of the way. The targeting matrix in this is kind of... improvised.\"",
										"The three of them scrambled away, just in time to see Nano's hastily-constructed turret let loose a beam of crackling energy, which then proceeded to sweep through the ranks of assailants, jerking up and down to eliminate targets both near and far.",
										"When the screeching turret at last quieted, Nano was the first to speak. \"Well, they aren't storing the warhead on the surface at least. Thankfully for us. Come on, it must be somewhere inside.\"\""

A planet might look harmless, but you might discover upon touching down that its atmosphere is poisonous or its \"water\" is actually liquid carbon dioxide. For this reason, most ships' come equipped with a complex planetary scanning system, designed to inform their crew about a planet from a safe distance.",
										"While you are in the Captain role of a ship with functional {@item sensors|darkmatter}, you can spend 1 hour to conduct an in-depth scan of a planet within your sensors' range to learn its basic geography and composition. If you spend 8 hours conducting a scan, you also learn any of the planet's major environmental hazards, such as high gravity, a poisonous atmosphere, or volcanic activity. If you spend 24 hours conducting a planetary scan, you also learn whether the planet's surface is inhabited, what general level of technology said inhabitants seem to possess (by detecting the presence of bronze, iron, steel, uranium, etc.), and its weather patterns over the next 24 hours.",
										"Occasionally, one or more of a planet's traits may prevent you from learning more about it. For example, a thick, cloudy atmosphere may prevent you from examining the planet's geography or learning about any inhabitants, or a strong arcano-magnetic field might disrupt the scan entirely.",
										"If your ship is equipped with a {@vehicle probe|darkmatter}, you can plunge it into the planet's atmosphere to get a closer look, potentially circumventing obstacles which prevent you from learning about the planet. Doing so allows you to gain a full 24-hour scan of the planet in 1 hour, but destroys the probe in the process.",
										"Information gained from planetary scans are stored on your ship's computer and can be later sold to interested parties, such as Astrogations Inc. Such payment is usually based on the planet's tier of habitability, with superior planets (at lower tiers) paying best, and special bonuses for rare finds, such as Tier X worlds."

Mere seconds after their arrival in Garfreckt's asteroid field, the dragon appeared on the sensor screens, an ominous rendering of wings and horns perched atop an asteroid, and a fearsome growl filled the vacuum of space. \"You fools think to rob me? Ha! Preposterous! I am Garfreckt, the Eternal Dragon!! And I can smell your humanoid stink from light years away.\"",

Both were starting to reach for their controls when the shockwave hit; the massive discharge of energy making waves in the very fabric of reality. Hurled from their seats, they were surprised to find themselves floating up to the ceiling, the artificial gravity temporarily disabled.",

										"As they closed on their goal, Rami appeared on the bridge, filthy and reeking of ozone. \"I've done all I can. Fabricator and arcane cannon are fried. Life support is busted too, but I've managed to rig the air filter up so we won't suffocate. At least, for a while. Also, while I was down there, I noticed that the antivirus module on the computer seems to be overheating... What do you reckon that's all about, Nano?\"",
										"The vect froze for a second, then leapt down the corridor to engineering, nearly bowling Rami over on the way through. \"You have the bridge, Mek!\"",
										"Nano's anguished scream could be heard even without the intercom. \"Mek, double-check the sensors! I think Garfreckt's figured out\u2014\"",
										"\"\u2014THAT YOU FOOLS THINK I WOULD FALL FOR SUCH A CHEAP TRICK!\" This time, Garfreckt's voice was transmitted over the ship's internal comms. \"I suggest you brace for impact,\" he growled, voice dripping with cold fury.",

The whole craft groaned under the impact; walls and floors bending and flexing as the superstructure twisted and buckled. The crew were tossed around viciously, with Rami blacking out due to the extreme forces.",

										"A wild cheer went up in the cantina. \"A round for my adoring fans!\" Rami waved her datapad, full of credits, in the direction of the bartender.",
										"\"So Garfreckt tried to space you? How did you escape?\" someone asked.",
										"\"Look, I don't want to say I outsmarted an eternal dragon...\" she paused. \"But he should have known I'd have a few scrolls handy. A terrific transport was perfect to get everyone together and out of the vacuum.\"",
										"\"Okay, but how did you get away from the asteroid?\" Came the immediate response. \"Your shuttle wouldn't have lasted six seconds against the dragon.\"",
										"\"You can thank him for that,\" she pointed at Mekhet-Nu, seated at the other end of the bar. \"Turns out he'd got in touch with some of his disciples ahead of time. They had a ship waiting for us right when we needed it.\"",
										"The crowd went quiet for a while. In a low voice, someone remarked: \"strange choice for a partner in crime.\"",
										"\"Hey, don't you be sneering at Mek. He's alright, for an avia-ra.\" She waved at him across the bar.",

										"Mekhet-Nu dived out of the way as the Blaster Prototype unleashed another unstable wave of energy.",
										"\"I did not expect such petulant behavior!\" The weapon, of course, said nothing. It was in one of its sulky moods today. Mekhet-Nu adopted a parental tone.",
										"\"Young miss, are you not the legendary Prototype, first of all blasters?\" The weapon's arcane engine revved, emitting bright blue exhaust from two ports like piercing eyes.",
										"\"Do you not possess terrific power?\" Again, the weapon unleashed a wild torrent of fire, this time scorching a training dummy to ash.",
										"\"Then why won't you yield?\" said the avia-ra, aggravation cracking his usual stony demeanor. Defiant, the blaster belched forth a wave of exhaust gas.",
										"Mekhet-Nu took a deep breath to center himself. The Blaster Prototype was not only alive, but downright tempestuous. Yet he had patience in droves. More importantly, he had no other options. When the High Priests of the Sun came for him, he and the Prototype would have to be ready.",
										"‒ ‒ ‒",
										"\"Almost... there...\" Nano groaned, leveraging the wrenchinator with all possible weight. As the bolt gave way, the entire chassis clunked into place and circuits sprung to life. Dragon's fire rushed outward from the breastplate, ejecting spouts of flame at every bolt and joint. As the flames reached the golem's extremities, its hands clenched and its head turned to see its creator.",
										"Nano was surprised that the trinket stolen from the dragon's hoard even fit, but dumbfounded to see it working. After all, the inside of the golem was now more vent tape than circuitry.",
										"\"Welcome to the 'verse, Mac!\" Nano knocked once on the golem's chest to hear the satisfying clunk. This was the gadget to end all gadgets! Should probably build some legs for it, though.",
										"‒ ‒ ‒",
										"Garfreckt, the eternal dragon, touched down on Sepa-Atef, blasting a massive cloud of sand out into the desert. In the distance, he could see mountains, some of them towering to two or three times his own height.",
										"The avia-ra delegation came buzzing over the jagged horizon in their Herald and Pilgrim class ships, golden livery glinting in the light from this planet's twin stars.",
										"Garfreckt signaled his lieutenants to welcome the High Priests of the Sun. \"Greetings, your eminences. The eternal dragon is greatly pleased to meet you face-to-face.\"",
										"\"The pleasure is all ours,\" gushed the priests' interpreter, bowing deeply, \"and we are most eager to do business with such a great and esteemed partner. Especially considering the... intelligence that you have recently acquired.\"",
										"As the priests took their thrones, a Scale & Fang wizard conjured an illusory image of Mekhet-Nu. \"We understand that you are seeking this man. What would you give to know where he is hiding, I wonder...?\""

											"Almost without explanation, this planetoid (if it can be called that) is shaped as an immense, circular plane, like a coin constantly flipping in its orbit, revealing first one face, then the other. It seems to be constructed of some unbelievably dense exotic metal, buried under some miles of soil and rock. No force maintains an artificial gravity on the flat planetoid, so all of its water congregates in a spherical ocean, atop the gravitational center. On this small ocean, gravity would appear to behave normally, but venturing further out onto the coin would reveal that gravity always points to the center, making the flat surface feel like a slope that grows ever steeper as one nears the edge."

Other than this bizarre construction, which relegates its north and south poles to the top and bottom faces of the cube, and bombards the other faces with intermittent but immense storms, this planet seems devoid of construction. How it maintains this shape is a mystery. The rest of its solar system, too, has perplexing geometries. It's nearest neighboring planet (whose orbit is closer to the parent star) is shaped as a tetrahedron, and its next nearest neighbor (further away from the star) is octahedral. The other two more distant planets have equally geometrical constructions. Most perplexing, the star itself (named Icosahedrax) has 20 sides, and radiates varying amounts of heat from its edges and its vertices. This star, too, seems more like a divine accident than a physical construction."

Its face, which takes up almost an entire hemisphere, is vaguely humanoid, with a pair of eyes the size of oceans and a gaping maw lined with jagged mountain ranges. What it eats and how it propels itself through space is a mystery. With powerful psionics, it might even be possible to communicate with the planet (thereby discovering that its motives are irredeemably evil), but doing so would no doubt enrage the planet, which despises all lesser lifeforms."

It is climate-controlled to have year-round balmy weather and mild seasons. Even the wild food growing here is abundant and delicious. As perfect as it might seem, underneath the ground is a mechanical hellscape in charge of maintaining conditions on the surface. Those that live here are little more than a servant population, held under despotic rule and charged with maintenance on the 'Paradise Machine.'"

Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that these oceans are not liquid water, but some other form of exotic fluid (liquid methane, blood, healing potion, mercury, tears, etc.)"

											"This planet is simultaneously two worlds: an idyllic Garden World by day, and a nightmarish hellscape by night. It is not simply that the land takes on a grim or beautiful aspect as its light changes; it seems that two planets literally occupy the same space here, alternating at dawn and dusk. Moreover, the two worlds are fully disparate, for where one might have a temple and a shaded forest, the other has a lake of lava and a craggy mountain. Only visitors to this world seem to notice the shift. Unattended objects, including those brought by visitors, and the planet's residents (monstrous and otherwise) simply vanish when the shift occurs, and reappear when their world returns."

				"You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 1,000-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, temperatures, and cosmic signals appropriate to the thing being depicted. You can't, however, create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.<br>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of an asteroid, you can make it rotate on its axis. Similarly, you can cause the image to make different sounds at different times.<br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. The image does, however, fool sensor systems. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and the image's other sensory qualities become faint for that creature."

In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.",
