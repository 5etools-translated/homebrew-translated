						"I remember the first time I saw a tabletop role-playing game book, more than twenty years ago. It was an exotic strange thing and after flicking a few pages... it hit me, I could finally re-live the adventures of the Lord of the Rings and of Final Fantasy VII with my friends, around a table, no limitations whatsoever, just us and pure imagination. I was hooked, and I have been ever since.",

						"But that was not the end of the story, something was missing. For many years, every character I created and almost every NPC and culture in my stories did not look like me. For a long time I did not question this, I just accepted it as a fact: people who looked like me simply did not belong to Fantasy.",
						"As I grew older, I saw how this happened in basically every facet of our society, certain voices are systematically left unheard, or worse.",
						"So eventually, I had a second awakening. I have been blessed with being the son of a single African woman that, in spite of all adversities, always made sure her children proudly knew where they came from. It is time for me to take this blessing and bring it to games.",
						"Wagadu does not come from a place of anger but rather from one of love. When you love something you want more of it, and you want to make it better. This book is just a first step, a first little step that I wish my awkward 14 years old me had been able to witness; I wish that, as he was planning the next adventure with his friends, those wonderful books had whispered to him \"Black and queer is beautiful, be the hero you truly want to be!\". Well now I am screaming it at the top of my lungs, enjoy.",

								"No one knows exactly why people fall into Wagadu but what is clear is that it's an irreversible process and that the only thing that the Fallen can do is band together to survive the beautiful and harsh world of Wagadu.",

That is because the Fallen constantly bring ideas and cultures with them when they get thrown into Wagadu.",
										"On average though, one can expect Wagadu's versions of things to \"wilder\" more fragmented and adventurous. For instance where as an Asiman Empire might stand for 2000 years in the Upper Worlds, its Wagadu reincarnation would span a few cycles, falling into ruins in between and maybe even being overrun by Spirit overlords for a couple of centuries\u2013additionally it might be much more diverse that its \"original\" counterpart, with people of all lineages flocking to its safety."

										"Wagadu is inhabited by all sorts of people, members of every lineage from all walks of life, but every single wagadian you'll meet in your adventures was not born there: they all \"fell\" from the Upper World.",
										"To those who remember it, the Fall felt like losing their senses while being about their activities in the Upper World, to others it felt like entering a vivid dream while asleep.",
										"To people in Wagadu, new Fallen appear like bright stars, burning through the sky before plummeting to the ground. The Fallen are usually protected by an egg-shell which cracks after impact, allowing the naked, slimy and confused person to make their way out. Unfortunately not all Fallen survive the impact either dying in the egg or crawling out to be greeted by one of the dangers of Wagadu before any help can make it on time.",
										"One thing that all people in Wagadu share is the memory loss that follows the Fall. For some people it is just big gaps in their life and for others it is as bad as not even knowing their name. Additionally recollections from the Upper World cannot be 100% trusted: they could be \"egg memories\"; the Fall is known to scramble people's minds and there is more than one story of old friends from the Upper World finding each other in Wagadu only to discover that they have very different versions of their shared experiences.",
										"It's an ancient and unbroken tradition for people of all cultures to offer help to the freshly Fallen and when falling stars brighten the sky someone is usually dispatched to find and help the new arrivals.",
										"If such parties don't find the Fallen and help them with food and equipment, very often ancestors and more rarely spirits, offer help. Yellow simple robes are typically given to the newly fallen.",
										"Falling patterns are mysterious but do not seem to be entirely random. Sometimes a disproportionate number of Asiman might fall in the vicinity of an ancient oasis city for instance, other times the patterns are indiscernible and some are even known to have fallen in the middle of the ocean (without being water-breathing Ikakis or Ndyams).",
										"Children born in Wagadu invariably grow up to join the spirit world which means that the only way to replenish cities and villages is through new Fallen; when people stop falling a slow decline sets in which leads inexorably to the extinction of every living person in Wagadu.",
										"After an extinction, whenever someone falls, a new Cycle begins. A cycle can last one generation or in some rare cases even centuries, as long as people keep falling and replenishing Wagadu. People typically fall in \"showers\" which means irregular waves of people at different times and places.",
										"The only reason why some cities and civilisations in Wagadu sometimes spans through Cycles is because they either reflect some ongoing state of things in the Upper World or because ancestors in Wagadu bestow the new Fallen with knowledge to carry on specific legacies and traditions."

During the dry season, many waterways shrink or dry up, grass withers and some trees shed their leaves while in the rainy season, lakes and rivers swell and nature grows lush and verdant.",

Lore-wise slavery is currently rare in Wagadu, and was mostly practiced by Spirits in the 6th era (and, according to some legends, in the first two eras as well), Wagadu's Spirits' slavery is closer to pre-colonial African serfdom/ slavery than to American chattel-slavery: most of Wagadu's slaves have some rights and some can even become rispected and wealthy community leaders (though always under the ownership of some Spirit). The spirits that enslave people justify this an \"orderly way\" to manage the \"intrusion\" of the Fallen in Wagadu and \"offer protection\" to the enslaved against some (often manufactured) threat.",
										"If you decide with the party to run a game in the 4th era instead then you might encounter many cycles that have \"conservative\" views on gender roles and sexuality: drums can be beaten only by men, only women carry things on their head, non-procreative sex might be frowned upon. Such type of close-mindedness might not be only patriarcal but could be matriarcal or even queer, such as in a society where heterosexual couples are entirely banned and the majority cannot express their affections freely.",
										"In most cycles of the following eras, such rules are largely forgotten and communities who uphold them would usually do that because of the influence of some very old but active ancestors from the 4th era (who could turn into an interesting villain for the players). Wagadu is an open-minded and diverse place and with forethought, these exceptions can enhance and highlight it, rather than undermine it."

								"Wagadu's lineages are not races: all Fallen are humans. In the Upper Realms and Wagadu ancestral and spiritual influences are so powerful that they end up affecting people's appearances and supernatural powers. This is what a lineage is, a physical manifestation of an ancestral and spiritual influence on you.",
								"For most individuals, lineages are typically \"inherited\" from one parent but that is not always the case, some children spontaneously manifest a lineage from a grandparents or from seemingly \"nowhere\" (Wagadu's scholars argue that if you dig deep, everyone is ultimately related to everyone, so every Fallen has ancestry in all lineages). Most babies are born with a visible lineage but a few are born \"latent\" with no discernable traits till they grow older (these late bloomers usually manifest a lineage by when they are teenagers). Some people switch between lineages during their life as well, realising they identify more with a different lineage than their family's. Most of the time such change is influenced by other members of that lineage but it can sometimes happen even without any contact with their new lineage. In such rare cases it's the attunement with a specific aspect of their existence that helps transform them (e.g. an isolated seafaring Ironblood that eventually turns Ikaki).",
								"Belonging to a lineage does not simply affect your looks; the new ways Ancestors and spirits behave with you and the changes to your body have such an impact that two members of the same lineage, even if from very different cultures, will always have something in common. The lonely Emere that was born out of an entirely Swala village will still have the same basic understanding of magic (\"Juju Knowledge\") that a magic trained Emere from the distant rainforest city has, thanks to mystical dreams and visits from Emere Ancestors\u2013even if she still identify as culturally part of the Rain Clouds, the dominant Swala culture of those grasslands, and loves taking out her cattle for pasture in between her magical studies."

										"It is said that the ancient Emere were weak and scared and that the animals and the spirits of the forest hunted them down mercilessly, forcing them into hiding.",
										"One of these dark days, a mother, while cooking for her twin sons, spilled millet seeds from her calabash and while she was picking them she noticed patterns. As she focused, the seeds floated upwards to the skies, becoming stars and laying bare the very threads that explain the universe\u2013she saw the past and she could see the future\u2013The other Emere saw fate reflected in her eyes and named her \"Alawo\".",
										"She was the first Seer of the Emere. With her power and the one of the Alawos who followed her, the elves began to unlock the secrets of reality and to develop the magic to fight back predators and then eventually the forest Spirits themselves.",
										"And so after many generations, High Elves became the kings and queens of the rainforests, their cities towering so high that it's said their tallest roofs were taller than Mahogany trees.",
										"The elected royals of those days were said to be Alawos, the Seer-Queen and Kings: their power was vast but their minds were troubled, they could see a terrible storm coming to strike the people of the forest and they did not know how to stop it.",
										"In their quest to secure the survival of their kingdoms, the Seer-Queen and Kings began to covet the magic of their peers; they believed that becoming more powerful would allow them to solve the mystery of the upcoming upheaval and save their people. This resulted in a terrible war which pitted Emere against Emere and led to the destruction of countless cities: the Seers Wars.",
										"From the smoldering ruins the surviving Seer-Royals realised they had brought destruction upon themselves in a terrible self-fulfilling prophecy. Surviving Emere of all walks of life got together below an ancient Iroko tree and decided to start the Ogboni society, elves sworn to advise the rules of Emere cities in the eras to come.",
										"The first Ogboni planted a Kapok tree to seal the pact, this tree is massive today and still stands tall in the Upper Realms, it's called the Ogboni Kapok.",
										"Additionally, this ancient Council split the magic of the Emere into half. Only half to the Alawos so they will never be as powerful as those who cause the Seers Wars, the other half they gave to a number remarkable animal and plant spirits which they elected as their forest gods\u2013these would help keep the Emere on the right path.",

								"Ancient Swala history claims that Nalangu, an Emere queen of those early days, was famous for her intellect and bravery. She was very strong and could run and hunt better than most men.",
								"One day queen Nalangu, during a very long hunt for a violent spirit, stumbled out of the rainforest, into a miombo forest and saw the sunrise at the edge of the savannah.",
								"She was mesmerised and moved by the view and she knew that that place had to become the home of her people.",
								"Initially she did not know how to accomplish the move: the food, the trails and the spirits she knew were all deep in the woods, not in the grasslands, so she spoke with elders, who tried to dissuade her and eventually, as her duties piled up, she almost forgot about the savanna.",
								"One night, as she slept, a magnificent female Eland appeared in her dream, brown silky fur and warm glowing eyes, and told her \"The grasslands have god-like spirits, seek and befriend them and you'll find a home for your people\".",
								"Nalangu, touched by the vision and confident she had been blessed by this Eland spirit, left her beadcrown to her brother and went into the Savanna.",
								"Inspired by the dream, she tried to speak with as many grassland spirits as she could:",
								"The spirits of grass themselves were so many and tiny that speaking with them was fruitless.",
								"The big cats tried to hunt her down and she met lionbloods that did not help her.",
								"The acacia and baobab trees listened to her but were too slow to deliberate.",
								"Many of the other spirits asked too much and offered too little.",
								"Just as Nalangu began to despair, a cow spirit offered to help and the queen realised that the most receptive spirits were cow, goat and other docile animals, who needed mortals to thrive and were happy to see her come to the grasslands.",
								"She did uncountable deals with these spirits, sealing bonds that would last for eras to come.",
								"Followed by cattle, the queen returned to gather her people and to leave the forest for good.",
								"Well provisioned, Nalangu's people marched into the middle of the savanna. They walked for days until they found a beautiful blue lake surrounded by giant Ironwood trees.",
								"There they all rested and quenched their thirst and even considered to make that peaceful corner a home for themselves. Unbeknownst to them, the Spirit of that lake had a rotten heart: it took the people's offerings but told them in an unintelligible spiritual language that it was not offering protection, deceiving them.",
								"During the night, it hovered like a mist over all the people and when they woke up, everybody was bound in iron chains.",
								"Neither Nalagu nor her fighters and sorcerers could do anything to stop the cruel water Spirit, since it never slept and constantly gazed upon his possessions with cold eyes.",
								"After many moons of slavery, just as people started to lose fait in the queen, a horned woman, somehow unseen by the water Spirit, appeared from the grasses to meet with Nalagu.",
								"It was as if time had stopped, the two spoke all night, not just about how to break free, but they connected in a way that most mortals and spirits don't connect. A special love blossomed in that windy and starry night.",
								"The following day, when Nalagu woke up, the woman was gone and in her heart she knew that that was the same being which had appeared earlier in her dream as an Eland.",
								"Suddenly everyone had gained horns and a newfound strength: they knew they were finally true children of the savanna. They all rose against the cruel Spirit and banished it deep into the lake.",
								"Victorious, Nalangu and her people reclaimed their cattle and possessions and broke free from their last chains, never to look back again."
