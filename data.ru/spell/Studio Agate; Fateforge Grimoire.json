The width of the outskirts will usually range from 300 to 1500 feet depending on the circumstances. Orientation in the outskirts requires one or several Wisdom (Survival) checks against your spell save DC, even for rangers in their favored terrain. In addition, neither the domain itself nor its outskirts are perceptible from the outside. Through a phenomenon of illusion, they simply appear as the continuity of their surroundings. Within the outskirts, part of the wondrous domain's features may be effective, at the leader's discretion.",

There, it is possible to build gravity-defying buildings, unmelting ice sculptures, eternally flowing fountains, etc. Such feats will still require appropriate skills and a suitable workforce, but the nature of the domain will considerably facilitate them.",
