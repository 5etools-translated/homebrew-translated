						"Inspiration can come from anywhere: a musician's song, the advice of a close friend, or just the trust that another being places in you. In my experience, few things can compare to the surge of joy and motivation that being inspired gives.",
						"I have often found inspiration in fantasy worlds and books of adventure, mystery, and magic. I grew up devouring every novel I was handed, seeking to lose myself in the words of another mind, channeling the images they evoked in my mind into my sketchbook. But it wasn't until I discovered tabletop roleplaying games that I felt truly empowered to create my own worlds, places like the ones that I so often found myself lost in. Even better, it let me share all the ideas in my head with my friends, and they could do the same with me. I was spellbound.",
						"It's been about twenty-five years since my first game. Since then, I've drawn endless inspiration from the imaginations of my friends and loved ones as we tell heroic stories around a table with dice and paper. I've found a circle of friends who share my love of dramatic storytelling, my belief that failure in games is just as exciting as success (maybe even more so), and my delight in being inspired by moments of improvisational brilliance. It's still surreal that we found a way to share that with the world; {@i Critical Role} has become a phenomenon that's surpassed my wildest dreams. Over the past few years, we've built the magical world of Exandria together, warts and all, and somehow it's become a world that millions of others have engaged with and invested their imaginations in. I hope it's inspired you to create your own adventures, stories, and joyful memories. Through Vox Machina's epic tale, the land of Tal'Dorei became a landscape rife with intrigue, conflict, and endless possibility... and we wanted to share it with you.",
						"Years ago, I had an opportunity to bring Tal'Dorei to the page and invite the world to tell their own stories in Exandria. The thrill of the opportunity was incredible, but the immense pressure and fear of failure (given my absolute lack of experience doing something like this) made it a strenuous journey on an incredibly short timeline. I was incredibly blessed to have become friends with the immeasurably brilliant James Haeck around that time, and I asked him to join me in this task. My good fortune found him agreeing, and with his help and inspiration, it somehow came together. With that, a limited run of the {@i {@loader Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting|collection/Matthew Mercer; TalDorei Campaign Guide.json}} went into the world.",
						"Time has passed, both in our world and within the world of Exandria. Vox Machina's greatest adventures came to a close. Looking two decades later (within Exandria), we embarked on a new adventure with the Mighty Nein in the land of Wildemount...but Vox Machina and Tal'Dorei remained deeply dear to my heart. The question arose: what would Tal'Dorei look like these two decades later? What changes would have taken place in the recovery following the Chroma Conclave and the ascension of the Whispered One? How would the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have adjusted to life after the end of their story? What dangers and threats, both old and new, would the next generation of heroes need to rise up against?",
						"Inspiration struck once more, and now that {@i Critical Role} had the means to do so...we needed to answer these questions for both ourselves and the numerous Critters who often conjectured as we did. \"{@book Who is on the Tal'Dorei Council?|TDCSR|3|Tal'Dorei Council}\" Well, we can finally answer that! I immediately called James Haeck back to the fray, and we were joined this time by the extraordinary mind and talents of Hannah Rose to elevate these ideas into something better than I could have hoped. Between us, Tal'Dorei was Reborn. We invite you to get lost in this world, learn of its intricacies and secrets, and, I hope, be inspired to make this world yours as well.",

Every civilization, from the largest empire to the tiniest nomadic clan, has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with history, but there is no known definitive story.",

Vasselheim became Exandria's oldest surviving city by virtue of not just being built long ago, but by enduring the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity} (which shall be elucidated presently), a miraculous feat that few other charted settlements can claim to have accomplished.",

												"From the divine hands of the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart} sprung forth the First Children, the {@book elves|TDCSR|5|elves}. It is thought that they were made in their creator's image, yet it is just as likely that the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}, and all the gods who shared their ideas with them, actually adopted forms inspired by the image of their creations. The First Children walked the lush Green and gazed upon the heavenly Blue as the gods tamed Primordial Creation around them.",
												"Not long after, in the scale of the cosmos, a second mortal creation was wrought by the divine {@deity The All-Hammer|Exandria|TDCSR|All-Hammer}: the {@book dwarves|TDCSR|5|dwarves}, a hearty people imbued with the desire to continue the gods' work\u2014taming a primordial world filled with the craft and invention of the divinity that lay beyond the ashen void.

												"As a note from the High Curator of {@book Emon's|TDCSR|4|Emon, the City of Fellowship} Cobalt Reserve, the chronicle of Vasselheim states that the gods were given form and name only when the peoples of Exandria began to worship them\u2014yet many of the various races of the world ascribe their creation to a single god or group of gods. It would be remiss to not at least conjecture that while the Protean Gods lacked distinct form, they still had unique thoughts, emotions, and motivations that were later codified through the worship of the people.",
												"As inspiration flowed from the Protean Gods, other creations followed, giving life to Exandria's many peoples. Here the mythic record of Vasselheim grows unclear, for while the {@book elves|TDCSR|5|elves}, {@book dwarves|TDCSR|5|dwarves}, and {@book humans|TDCSR|5|humans} were undeniably Exandria's first races, the identities of the many Children of Creation that followed were left unrecorded by the Dawn City's chroniclers.",
												"These myriad young races explored their freshly founded world. As their knowledge grew, they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the lives of the children were extinguished mercilessly by the still-chaotic world. Sorrow is said to have filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against a land that rebuked them. The gods ultimately lent their children tiny fragments of their own power, gifts with which they might shape the world around them.",
												"This small mercy of the gods was the birth of magic, and with it the people of Exandria learned to bend the angry earth to their will, to temper the wrath of its explosive mountains, to tame its unyielding floods, and to make the hard earth soft and bountiful. Wandering peoples settled, language became commonplace, survival gave way to art, and governance replaced anarchy. The Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good\u2014but fragile, and in need of guardians.",
												"Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Tal'Dorei. These Protectors pledged themselves to defend the weak against tyrants. It is here that the mythic tales connect to the oldest, most fragmented passages of recorded history as civilization's reach stretched across the world. The people praised the gods for their newfound safety, and their prayers gave them forms, names, and purpose."

Underneath each land mass are blue crystals\u2014it's these that cause the land to float. Upon each piece of land is a large colorful city consisting of many towers, parapets, and domes."

												"Ages passed, and society flourished. Great kingdoms sprung up. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power. Even though magic could be used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new forms of life and power.",
												"Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the very magic which allowed mortalkind to prosper also instilled a deep rot within their civilizations. The arcanists of the world grew arrogant. They came to see their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, and that with a sophisticated enough command of magic, they could become as powerful as the gods themselves. Though this hurt and surprised the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} who had imprisoned their kin for the sake of their children, they sought to sympathize with the willfulness of their creations, remaining out of love and hoping that the mortals would learn the error of their ways.",
												"The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty, but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Rather than universal goodwill and comfort for all, the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|2|Age of Arcanum} came to be defined by endless petty squabbles over wealth and power among the elite, while those without magic hunted for their scraps. Tantalizing rumors of a path to immortality slithered through the most decadent circles of magi and nobility. One mortal mage, her name lost and presumed to be struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making of her the first and only living mortal to ascend. The name of this original death god was likewise lost to history. Only the title of his now-godly successor, the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens}, survives.",
												"Her victory over divinity was a catalyst for many of the horrors of the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|2|Age of Arcanum}. An archmage named Vespin Chloras, renowned throughout ancient Vasselheim for his wealth, skill, and cruelty, was inspired by this display. He sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the Betrayers into the mortal world.",
												"In their imprisonment, these Gods of Hatred and Despair had warped their prisons into reflections of their depravity. The Abyss, once a formless place of chaos, a byproduct of the gods' Creation, was twisted into a place of evil. Countless other planes of cruelty were born from the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} hatred, and those realms' evil depths endlessly churned forth horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed.",
												"Released unto the mortal world once more, the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} urge to ruin was supplanted by the desire to dominate, and they turned their sights first to the archmage who had freed them, making Vespin the first of their many mortal thralls. Records of diabolical texts safeguarded within the libraries of the {@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|4|5. Alabaster Lyceum} suggest that Vespin, now long dead, serves the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} to this day\u2014now as a devil at the left hand of the {@deity The Lord of the Hells|Exandria|TDCSR|Lord of the Hells}. These corrupt gods sought out the shattered remnants of the devils they had crafted and the demons they conscripted, and secretly created with them a fearsome new kingdom on the far end of the world, the capital of which was named Ghor Dranas, the Gathering of Shadows.",
												"In this land, where the twisted power of the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} corrupted planes seeped into the world, the lords of evil welcomed mortals whose heartlessness and lust for power made them susceptible to the gods' grand promises. The most fertile soil of all for these noxious seeds lay in mortal hearts obsessed with the infinite power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods} soon made their presence known to the world with a surprise assault on Vasselheim itself.",
												"Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of their protectors, the metallic dragons, and even a number of the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} themselves. The creators descended to trade blows with their former brethren. The battle, which pitted gods against mortals and heroes against demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights, until the dark forces were forced to retreat, their surprise attack thwarted.",
												"Yet this victory was a tainted one. Evil had been repulsed momentarily, but the revelation of such a terrible foe incited an arcane arms race. Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|3|Betrayer Gods}, who could be true allies? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of divinity, what value did mortal lives hold? Fearing all powers but their own, the most self-interested and singular human arcanists warped their greatest creations, magical instruments of prosperity and joy, into arms and armor of horrific power. The {@book dwarves'|TDCSR|5|dwarves} fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed further into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. {@book Elves|TDCSR|5|elves} used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never before seen.",
												"For the first time since the awakening of the Primordials, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity}."

One tale even tells of a champion blessed by three of the gods in their times of greatest need. Now all but forgotten, this Apotheon was forced by fate into terrible battles across the world.",

Even the ley lines that direct the flow of magic across Exandria like veins direct blood through the body show signs of being warped by the raw power that the Calamity unleashed. Some well-preserved ruins of the ancient civilizations remain, such as the Drowned City of Cael Morrow in the lands of {@book Marquet|TDCSR|4|Marquet}, but for the most part, all traces of the old world were erased from the face of Exandria.",
										"So great was the loss of life during the war that even liberal estimates suggest no more than a third of Exandria's population survived it. This unthinkable devastation inspired some civilizations to flee Exandria entirely and seek refuge on other planes, scattering the Children of Creation across the multiverse. By the war's end, the only bastion of civilization left on the face of Exandria was the Dawn City itself: Vasselheim."

This proclamation shocked the other {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|3|Prime Deities} and the beleaguered survivors of the war in equal measure, but while mortals railed against this announcement, the other gods quickly realized that the decision of the two most dutiful and self-sacrificing of their number was unimpeachable and just.",

It was the hardy, dependable {@book dwarves|TDCSR|5|dwarves} who best weathered the war between gods and mortals, beneath the {@book Cliffkeep Mountains|TDCSR|4|Cliffkeep Mountains}. Dozens of dwarven redoubts rose and fell in the tumult of the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|2|The Calamity} and the uncertain era that followed it.

Proud of their grand new home, the dwarf clans were content to remain beneath the earth. They saw the war-scarred surface world as a source of naught but misery and death, and their new underground domain as a place of undiscovered prosperity. This city was dug underneath the mountains, and its deep roots, though young, survived where more ancient ancestral halls were annihilated. Clan Jaggenstrike were the architects of {@book Kraghammer's|TDCSR|4|Kraghammer} hardy, unassailable redoubts, and easily became the first ruling clan of the {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|4|Kraghammer} {@book dwarves|TDCSR|5|dwarves}.",

They returned at the turning of the ages under the guidance of an elven sorceress named Yenlara Alderwreath.",

A ruler must know sacrifice, for how else are they to know those who till the fields, who tend to the cattle, and who raise our children? A ruler should know pain and sorrow, for war is bloody and cruel. A ruler who asks their people to fight is one who asks them to die, and no person should die for a selfish king or an unjust cause. A ruler should know justice, but also mercy, for not all crimes are committed with evil intent, but rather in grief and shame. I am no king. I am the peasant in the fields. I am the painter at the easel. I am the young soldier donning their father's rusted armor. You will not find me sitting upon a bejeweled throne disdaining my supplicants, but working beside your mothers and fathers, fighting beside your valorous children, and aiding those who have suffered in the name of unjust kings.",

A creature from the Elemental Plane of Ice slunk into the Material Plane through a hitherto unknown rift between the planes. It appeared in a mystical forest of eternal winter known today as the {@book Frostweald|TDCSR|4|The Frostweald}. From its hibernal abode, this elemental spirit spied upon the untested realm of Tal'Dorei and saw an opportunity. The spirit dove back to its extraplanar home and informed its master of a land ripe for conquest. Errevon the Rimelord, a cruel elemental so mighty that he is speculated to have been a scion of the Primordials, one that escaped the gods' wrath in the {@book Founding|TDCSR|2|The Founding}, seized this opportunity.",
												"On the next winter solstice, Errevon tore wide the {@book Frostweald|TDCSR|4|The Frostweald} rift and commanded the endless blizzards of his home plane to ravage the prosperous land around it. Tal'Dorei's southern reaches, thus weakened, were easy pickings for the Algid Legion, a mighty army of frost giants and animate blizzards led by the Rimelord himself. Their relentless advance covered all they touched in snow and death.",
												"Countless brave warriors and civilians alike fell to the invaders' gelid weapons, for they were unprepared for such an onslaught so soon after the {@book Drassigs'|TDCSR|2|The Iron Rule of Drassig} protracted war. The storm of ice widened year by year, consuming the Tal'Dorei heartland as Errevon claimed all lands that fell beneath the ice as his own. North of the rift, he built a towering citadel of frost, forcing those he conquered to swear fealty in exchange for warmth and liquid water. The Rimelord's tyranny lasted for three long years as the nascent {@book Council of Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|3|Tal'Dorei Council} struggled to convince {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|4|Syngorn} and {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|4|Kraghammer} to ally for the sake of the realm.

It was in this time of need that the druidic Ashari people first revealed themselves to the people of Tal'Dorei, and used their unrivaled elemental magic to seal the rift once and for all. The snow began to melt, the fortress toppled into the nearby {@book Foramere Basin|TDCSR|4|Foramere Basin}, and the people celebrated their freedom from the oppressive cold.

This {@book Council of Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|3|Tal'Dorei Council} worked alongside their sovereign to rebuild the realm following the end of {@book Drassig's|TDCSR|2|The Iron Rule of Drassig} line, and were instrumental in the following prosperity of the nascent Tal'Dorei Empire.",

												"If a spell has a component cost that consumes the component, its caster can substitute the required component for an amount of {@item residuum|TDCSR} of an equal value.

												"{@item Residuum|TDCSR} can also be heated and blown into glass, forming a shimmering, greenish surface. Residuum slates or orbs can be used in stationary enchanting tables. Archmages willing to pay exorbitant rates\u2014easily 20,000 gp or more\u2014may acquire an {@item Residuum enchanting slate|TDCSR|enchanting slate} that can be used to expedite the creation of all magic items. Using such a table allows anyone crafting a magic item to do so in one-quarter of the usual time."

Few outlanders from the north, known as orfindes to the Orroyen, have been allowed into any of the dozens of Orroyen tribes, and the elders have little intention of changing this, for they have heard distant tales of the ancient tyranny of {@book Drassig|TDCSR|2|The Iron Rule of Drassig} and the supernatural horrors the people of northern {@book Gwessar|TDCSR|2|Gwessar} invite upon themselves.",
										"Nevertheless, the Orroyen are practical, not prideful. They trade often with the Free Folk of Mornset, and sometimes even travel as far north as {@book Byroden|TDCSR|4|Byroden} to trade rare goods. There, some Orroyen meet people from {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|4|Syngorn} or beyond and share stories of their lands. Love can bloom in these meetings of separate worlds, and sometime results in an orfinde being brought into an Orroyen clan. And sometimes curious Orroyen leave simply to see the world beyond the jungle."

There is no doubt that this jungle is as magical and mysterious as Tal'Dorei's temperate forests, for the jungle's greenery is home to countless mystical spirits, ferocious monsters, and arcane mysteries. The vine-strangled floors of the jungle are clustered with swollen trunks, spine-laden ferns, and carnivorous plant life that waits for the unknowing wanderer to make an incorrect step.",

Clusters of venomous insects buzz through the mist-shrouded trees, alongside large lizards, and wild beasts in search of carrion. Sunken valleys lead to pockets of marshland or quicksand pit traps, while others are wrought with a dire, spreading fungus. Those who have lived all their lives in this environment know its dangers well and have hundreds of years of precautions to take against them. On the other hand, those who venture into the jungle from northern Tal'Dorei rarely return, and those that do warn others to never make the same mistake.",
