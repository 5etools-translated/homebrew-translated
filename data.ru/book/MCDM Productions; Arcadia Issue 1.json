Uqaviel, known for his love of the dawnfire and framed for the sin, was left to take the blame for the slaughter. His protestations of innocence were ignored by his once-friends; with archdevil magic empowering each twisting word, Anahita spoke truth to the host's holy ears, and Uqaviel could not escape judgment.",

For the betrayal of Anahita and the celestials, Uqaviel hopes to sever the ties between the Material Plane and the celestial realms, creating a catastrophic unbalance that would destroy them both. In doing so, he would ruin the perfect balance he spent so long maintaining as punishment for his fall. See \"A Severed World\" below for more details about this sundering.",

When playing Uqaviel, it's helpful to keep his deeper motivations in mind. He is entrenched in rage, but the deepest part of him has a strong spark of goodness.
