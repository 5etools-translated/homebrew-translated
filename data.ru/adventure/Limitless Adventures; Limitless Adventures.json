These encounters were purposefully not designed for a certain level range. Some encounters may require players to come up with solutions other than combat. The world is a scary place and sometimes you may have to run for your life.",
								"These modules can be used to craft a random encounter table for travel and exploration, to fill in the hexes of a sandbox, or whenever your players wander to a location for which you had not yet prepared. Feel free to change the names, treasures, and the number of creatures as you see fit.",

These hooks are merely suggestions for continuing a plot and should be used or ignored at your discretion. For example, if a hook suggests that the Duchess was the murderer, that is a just a possible twist you could build from and needn't be acted upon if it would disrupt your campaign."
