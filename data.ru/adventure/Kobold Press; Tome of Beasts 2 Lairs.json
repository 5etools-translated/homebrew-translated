With a new supply of coins and valuables, the greed swarm reconstituted. The valkruung is delighted with its new companion, treating it as a shiny, jingly pet.

However, after the greed swarm reconstituted, the robberies increased in frequency and value, attracting more attention.",

The crocotta believed the fort would make an ideal home, but the gates were still barred shut. Determined, it started digging beneath the palisade, encouraging the hyenas to assist. The digging undermined a section of wall on one of the buildings, causing a partial collapse and disturbing a pestilence swarm, the original bearers of the disease that killed the fort's inhabitants. The swarm, its cozy shelter now exposed to daylight, flew off. The pestilence swarm eventually attacked a nearby village (see {@area Pestilence Descends|tffpd|x}). Meanwhile, the crocotta and its hyena allies settled into their new home.",

A month ago, a group of clerics traveled to the obelisk and conducted a ritual that sought to bend the magic of the obelisk to their will in an effort to contact a powerful fey lord. To their dismay, the ritual backfired, forcing them to retreat and corrupting the natural world around them. Ilkarayda was killed in the backfire, enraging her bonded vine golem (see {@area 6|ttw6|u}). The golem then attacked and drove off the remaining pilgrims. Since then, the Twisted Wreath has turned into a dangerous garden filled with monstrous creatures.",

A week ago, necrotic power surged out of the rift, transforming the fallen Ilkarayda into a tree skinner (see {@area 7|ttw7|u}) and drawing the attention of a local circle of druids."
