				"Shrouded in a cloak dark as pitch, a female halfling skulks through the night, hiding in the shadows of a sleeping city. She clutches a crescent-moon amulet strung around her neck and exudes a whispering sigh. The halfling's blackened chain link armor makes not a sound, and she skirts undetected past a trio of patrolling guards with preternatural ease.",
				"A human woman wearing heavy black armor and a mantle adorned with the head of a raven holds her ground against a cadre of skeletal warriors. Silhouetted by the light of a full moon, she flourishes her cloak and instantly vanishes before her attackers. Reappearing behind the undead, the skeletons stagger blindly as a rain of silver-burning smites fall amongst them.",
				"As he springs away from his pursuers, a male tiefling in dusky leather armor grasps an ornamental spiked chain bound around his wrist. Tendrils of darkness seep from his fingers, swimming out to blind and engulf his foes.",
				"The Oath of the Midnight Hour is a pledge to serve as the weapon of a dark patron that eschews the light of day. This patron can be of any alignment or agenda, and it is said the first paladins to swear this Oath swore it to the night itself, to defend night travelers from those that would prey on them. Paladins that take this oath are most frequently known as night-watchers, shadowguards, or darksworn.",
				"Most paladins that pledge this Oath are lawful and loyal to the decrees of their patron, be their patron god or monster. Chaotic paladins of this oath do exist, however, and occasionally find themselves at odds with their own master, struggling for freedom or redemption against the very force they swore to obey. For their part, particularly evil patrons with ties to undeath (such as Strahd, Vecna, or Tenebrous) may visit mortals on the verge of dying and require that they undertake this Oath of service to continue living. Good and neutral patrons often merely have the paladin swear this Oath at midnight under a portentous lunar auspice (usually a new, full, crescent, or blood moon) before they enter service.",
				"Paladins of the Midnight Hour universally wear shades of dark brown, grey, and black, and are equally at home in leathers as they are in mail or plate. Always a foreboding sight, even good-aligned paladins of this Oath sometimes find themselves the target of fear, suspicion, and prejudice from those afraid of what they represent.",
