Upon casting, all the clothing you're wearing transforms into your magical uniform and grants you your Magical Tiara, which is necessary to cast the Radiant Tiara cantrip. Your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier. While in this form, you become unrecognizable to every other creature, regardless of how well they know you, although your appearance barely changes. Only those that witness the actual transformation will be able to discern your secret identity. In addition to these features, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Sorcerer level. The spell ends if you don armor, or if you dismiss the spell as an action."
