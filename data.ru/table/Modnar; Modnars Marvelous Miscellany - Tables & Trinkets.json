The party is hired by fearful authorities to stop the revolt that threatens to scale into a civil war, but one of the tenants in the rebel building is a PC's distant relative.

Will the party surrender their treasure to tax or will they risk it to a theft?"

					"37",
					"\"Psst, do you want to buy a crystal ball that really works? It's cheap!\" says a shady character while sneaking up on the PCs from an alley. The price really is cheap, and you might even lead the PCs to believe the ball works when they try to use it for petty things, but it is unreliable, maybe even cursed.

For example, the item could be a signet-ring or seal of a noble or royal (maybe it's a high-end fake, maybe it's the real-deal that was recently stolen), or perhaps just a small bag of very valuable gems. No matter what it actually is, you have it now, and boy are there people who are going to try to make you regret it."

					"Gorgon Roast: While not technically edible itself, the rocky/metallic remains of a Gorgon Bull Male am excellent oven for the smart, open minded adventurer. Lighting a fire beneath an I damaged portion of the bill allows you to turn it into a giant cooling vessel. Always aim to remove the head cleanly for the best results. Once slain, it will become perfectly hollow, but always allow to air for one hour to allow any remnants of its vapours to escape.

You should now have a filling, spicy dish that will revitalise you and leave you feeling refreshed and ready to carry on, night or day!"
				],
				[
					"40",
					"Manticore Skewers: Slightly dangerous. Never break the spines, and only ever use unbroken spines to begin with. Cut the manticore meat into bite sized pieces before skewering. Roast on an open fire. If the spine explodes, do not eat the meat. If prepared correctly, the spicy, fiery toxin will denature and become something akin to a sauce or marinade as it leaches out of the skewer and into the meat as it cooks. Not for the faint of heart."
				],
				[
					"41",
					"Dragon: A notoriously difficult meat. Dragons are normally sentient creatures, but the lesser dragons (including wyverns and wyrms) are considered fair game. Excluding the alchemical ingredients, such as the eyes or heart (which must always be consumed raw if used in magical recipes or rituals), most of a dragon is meat, just like any animal. After the arduous task of scaling (best done with the beasts own claws or teeth), the meat must be cooked on an incredibly hot flame, regardless of species. It is believed to be physically impossible to overlook dragon. Also, the dragons tongue is entirely edible. Often considered an alchemical ingredient, it can be cooked or dried into jerky. It often holds a little innate magic, transferring the knowledge of languages the creature knew in life, if any. An interesting (and tasty) way to learn some new words."
				],
				[
					"42",
					"Gryphon sirloin: Often utterly ruined by the casual adventurer, the Gryphon should be butchered by a professional whenever possible. A well prepared, fresh Gryphon sirloin will often fetch as much money as the party will receive from felling the beast in the first place! Surprisingly tender and flavourful, the meat is a strange combination of white and red, fusing the best of both into some of the best meat known to men or elves."
				],
				[
					"43",
					"Fried Goblin Ears: Works with a variety of ears, so long as the adventurer isn't picky or is desperate. Favourite snacks of the bandit tribes of the south, the fried ears of their foes are enjoyed by all ages after the rest of the corpse has been robbed, stripped and butchered... maybe skip this recipe..."
				],
				[
					"44",
					"Whole Roast Dire Boar: Wild pigs have nothing on the elusive Dire Boar. Even Dire Wolf packs think twice before attempting to bring down one of these colossal swine! Often as big as a small elephant, the only way to enjoy this is to roast it whole. Make it a celebration. The whole hunting party should help gathering wood and building a large enough spit to cook the kill. Carve away meat once cooked like kebab meat and enjoy with the whole village!"
				],
				[
					"45",
					"Roast potatoes in Troll Fat: No duck fat for these crispy adventurers favourites! Simply roast in a clay oven after cutting into quarters and covering liberally with Troll fat."
				],
				[
					"46",
					"Kraken caviar: Incredibly rare and extremely expensive, only the richest of kings and emperors will ever be able to dine on the freshly laid eggs of a Kraken. These things are released en masse and grow rapidly to try and combat the multitude of oceanic predators that feed on their young. These must be caught and consumed less than 5 days after being laid. After that, if exposed to water, these regular looking roe will rapidly expand to the size of a cannonball and continue to absorb nearby water until it holds a pocket of water roughly 5ft in diameter."
				],
				[
					"47",
					"Hydra Eggs: With a similar property to their adult counterparts, the yolk of a hydra egg will appear to split up to 5 times while being beaten. If fried, the yolk turns a deep amber colour."
				],
				[
					"48",
					"Owlbear Steak: Very ‚Äògamey', but perfect for jerky. Plenty of meat on an Owlbear too."
				],
				[
					"49",
					"Roast Behir: The only way to enjoy the multi-legged dragon lookalike. After removing the electric glands and other organs, the meat of a Behir should be either smoked or roasted. Most adventurers miss out on the best flavour of this mountain dwelling creature. Properly cooked, Behir meat should have a taste reminiscent of the air after a lightning storm. Pairs well with cheese, oddly enough."
				],
				[
					"50",
					"Ants on a Log: Raisins and peanut butter slathered on beholder eyestalks (replaces celery stalks)."
				],

				],
				[
					"67",

This dished is traditionally served in a family style fashion by dumping in a large pile on a table and dumping additional spices directly on top."
				],

					"Fondgoo: An insane eccentric aspiring gourmet turned adventurer developed this after a horrific adventure in a ooze laboratory. Combining the jelly of a gelatinous cube with copious amounts of cheese and wine over high heat, you are able to neutralize most of the acidic elements to create an amazing dish. A mild anesthetizing effect tickles and numbs the mouth, preventing speech for a minute after consumption. Some consider this a boon and it is a frequent dish at many upper-class family reunions."
				],
				[
					"69",
					"Flesh Fondgoo: Captured by a human from beyond the stars with an unnatural hunger, the chef only had servitude as a survival option. Becoming comforter and preparer of meals, the new take on the fondgoo proved to be delectable with the right ingredients. Thin slices of half-orc proved to be the most popular with the star cannibal and his crew, wildly rich with only mild game flavor from the mixed heritage. The gourmet would never admit it to anyone, but his refined palate preferred the gnoll. The terror only ended after discovering what they thought was a holy grail, a Hungering Flesh that went from cornucopia to consumer in no short order."

The Stirge is prepared on a campfire, but because of the many types of blood that it sucks, it often leads to the eater contracting some sort of disease."

					"Remorhaz Stew: Remorhaz is a wonderful meat for stews in that it retains heat forever! The Heat immune properties of the Remorhaz become fallible after their death, but they still require extremely high temperatures to be able to cook. Think smelting furnace, not oven. With such high temperatures required, Remorhaz needs to be cooked by eye due to the limited availability of such heat sources. Dice into evenly sized chunks and cook until very slightly crisp on the outside, tossing as you go before adding to a stew. Sufficiently heated Remorhaz meat will stay hot for hours, even up to a day or two, keeping any stew it is added to hot as long as you wish."

Cut the flank steaks off of the body and marinade them for at least a full day before roasting while continuously basting with the drippings.

					"Honeyed Siren's Tongue: The tongue of a siren produces the most wonderful sound when chewed, bards will often accompany instrumental performances with the chewing of a Siren's tongue in order to woo crowds even further.

The longest rib cage you will find, gather up your town, or the local goliath tribe, and you'll make a killing off of these. Flay the scales and smoke at a low heat over hickory logs for 2 days, slowly rotating the ribs through. A nice baste of dwarven ale mixed with citrus, or a rub of an orcish spice blend will make this a meal to remember. Just keep in mind the smell will travel for miles, so you might attract a nearby Roc."
				],
				[
					"100",
					"Roc Stock & Balor: While not actually made with Balor flesh, this demonic delicacy is as the name implies a stew made from Roc stock and any sort of demonic flesh. Due to the hellish nature of the flesh, the stew does not need any outside heat to work itself to a hearty temperature. Good for those in survivalist situations, assuming you can ignore the faint brimstone smell."
