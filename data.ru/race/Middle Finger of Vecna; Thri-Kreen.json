Dasl weapons are very fragile, and must be remade every 24 hours to maintain effectiveness. A non thri-kreen character is not proficient with dasl weapons. When you roll a 1 on an attack made with a dasl weapon, the weapon shatters and becomes unusable. dasl gythkas, spears, and javelins that shatter in this way become ordinary quarterstaves."
